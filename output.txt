Bharadwaja Goes to indra to Learn the Science of Life
3. Bharadvaja, the mighty ascetic, in search of the science of longevity (Dirgha Jivita—dīrgha-jīvita) approached Indra, having deemed him, the lord of the immortals, worthy of suit;
4-5. Daksa Prajapati, the progenitor, first obtained the Science of Life in its entirety as promulgated by Brahma the Great one i.e., the Creator and from him, in turn, the Ashwin Twins obtained it. From the Ashwin Twins the god Shakra (Indra) acquired it. Therefore Bharadvaja bidden by the sages approached Shakra.
When diseases arose like so many impediments to the austerity, fasting study, continence and vows of embodied souls, the great sages—the doers of good—keeping compassion for creatures foremost, met together on the sacred slopes of the Himalayas.
8-14½. Angiras, Jamadagni, Vasishtha, Kashyapa, Bhrigu, Atreya, Gautama, Sankhya, Pulastya, Narada, Asita, Agastya, Vamdeva [Vāmadeva], Markandeya Ashvalayana, Parikshi, Atreya the Mendicant, Bharadvaja, Kapinjala, Cyavana, Abhijit, Gargya, Shandilya, Kaundilya, Varkshi, Devala and Galava, Sankritya, Vaijavapi, Kushika, Badarayana, Badisha, Sharaloma, and both Kapya and Katyayana, Kankayana, Kaikasheya, Dhaumya, Marica, Kashyapa. Sharkaraksha, Hiranyaka, Lokaksha and Paingi: likewise, Shaunaka, Shakuneya, Maitreya, Maimatayani, the forest-dwelling hermits, Valakhilyas, and likewise other great sages—all of them veritable mines of the Brahmic lore, and of restraint and discipline and resplendent with the glow of austerities like to fires fed with oblations—seated at ease there, initiated the following inquiry
15-16½. “Health is the supreme foundation of virtue, wealth,enjoyment and salvation. Now, diseases are the destroyers of health, of the good of life, and even of life itself. Thus has arisen the great impediment to the progress of humanity. What shall be the means of remedying it?” Having observed thus, they sat in meditation.
17-17½. Then, they saw with the eye of understanding, their refuge in Indra, “He, the lord of the immortals, shall tell us rightly the means of overcoming disease.
18-18. Who will go to the abode of the thousand-eyed Indra in order to inquire and learn from him the lord of Shaci?” “I should be charged with this mission”;—The first to speak these words was Bharadvaja. Hence was he commissioned by the sages.
20. Having gone to the abode of Indra, he saw him, the slayer of, Bala, seated amidst celestial sages and shining like fire.
21. Having approached the chief of the gods, and saluting him with benedictory cries of ‘Victory’, he, the intelligent one, delivered with humility the excellent message of the sages.
22. “Diseases have arisen, which are the terror of all human beings. Tell me, O Lord of the immortals I the appropriate means of remedying them.”
Indra Imparts the Science to Bharadvaja
23. Unto the sage, the great Lord Shatakratu (Indra), knowing his wide understanding, propounded in a few of Life.
24. He taught the science of causes, symptoms and medication, the supreme refuge of both the healthy and the ailing, the tripartite science, eternal and holy, which the Great Father, Brahma, knew.
25. He, the sage of great understanding, soon learned correctly, by single-minded devotion, the whole Science of Life, tri-based and extending without end.
26. Bharadvaja thereby acquired unmeasured life endowed with happiness, and in his turn, taught the science to the sages, without either adding or withholding any part.
The spread of the Science on Earth
27. And the sages, desiring longevity, received from Bharadvaja that science, beneficial to humanity and promotive of life.
28-29. These great sages perceived this science in its_true nature with the eye of discernment; the nature of the genera and the particular; the substances, their qualities, action and coexistant relation; and understanding it and conforming to the rules laid down in the system. they attained the highest happiness and enduring life.
30. Thereafter, Punarvasu the most benevolent,. moved by compassion for all creatures, bestowed the science of life on his six disciples.
31. Agnivesha, Bhela, Jatukarna, Parashara, Harita, and Ksharapani received the teaching of that sage.
32. It was the excellence of his own understanding and not any difference in instruction by the sage whereby Agnivesa became the foremost compiler of the Science.
33. Thereafter Bhela and the rest-made each his own compilation of the science; and these talented ones read them out to Atreya and the assembly of the sages.
34. The sages, having listend to the presentation of the subject by these holy men, rejoiced acclaiming that the science had been truly presented.
35. All of them, pursuant of the welfare of all creatures, extolled the authors exclaiming together, “Great is your compassion for creatures.”
36. The celestial sages, together with the immortals stationed in Heaven, heard that auspicious cry of the great sages, and hearing rejoiced greatly.
37. “O, well-done!”—that ovation, generous and profound, echoed with joy by all creatures in the sky, resounded throughout the three worlds.
38. The winds blew salubriously; all the quarters expanded with radiance; and divine showers of blossoms together with rain, descended.
39. Thereafter, the goddesses of Enlightenment, Understanding, Achievement, Memory, Genius, Resolution, Eloquence, Forgiveness and Compassion entered, into Agnivesa and the rest.
40. The compilations of these disciples, which were thus approved by the great sages, obtained currency in the world for the well-being of the multitudes of living beings.
What Is the Science of Life?
41. That is named the Science of Life, wherein are laid down the good and the bad of life, the happy and the unhappy life, and what is wholesome and what is unwholesome in relation to life, as also the measure of life.
The Synonyms for ‘Life’
42. Life is spoken of by such synonyms as “the union of the body senses, mind and spirit”, “the support”, “animation”, “the flux”, and “the link” between the past life and the future one.
The Superior Excellence of the Science
43. The science relating to Life is regarded by the philosophers as the most meritorious of all the sciences, because it teaches mankind what constitutes their good in both the worlds.
The General and the Particular
44. The ‘General’ is the cause of the increase of all things at all times and the ‘Particular’ is the cause of their decrease, whereas the application of these principles in the treatment of the body leads to increase or decrease of body-elements.
45.The General combines; the Particular differentiates; for, the element of agreement is the General, while the Particular is the reverse.
The Subject Matter of the Science
46. The mind, spirit and body are together, as it were, the tripod; the world endures by reason of cohesion, and on that are all things established.
47. That aggregate of the mind, spirit and body is Man; he is the conscious agent. He is regarded as the subject-matter of this science; and it is indeed for his sake that this science has been promulgated.
Substances and their Two Classifications
48. The five proto-elements, ether and the others, together with the spirit, mind, time and space, constitute the totality of substances. Possessed of the senses, a substance is animate; devoid of the senses, it is inanimate.
Qualities and Actions
48½-49. The sense-objects, the qualities such as heaviness etc., the intelligence, the list of qualities ending with effort, and the qualities ‘higher’ etc.—these are the qualities.
Behaviour such as effort etc., is described as ‘action’.
Coexistence Defined
50. Samavaya—or coexistence is defined as that inseparable relationship which subsists between earth and other proto-elements and their qualities. This relationship is eternal; for, wherever the substance exists the coexistent quality is never absent.
Substance, Quality and Action Defined
50½. That which is the substratum of action and qualities and is the ' coexistent cause is ‘substance.’
51. ‘Quality’ is the coexistent and inactive cause.
52. ‘Action,’ which is the cause of conjunction and disjunction, resides in the substance. Action is the performance of what is to be done. It depends on nothing else.
Thus has been defined, ‘Cause’.
The Objective of the Science
53. The action here i.e. in medicine, is establishing “the equilibrium of the body-elements,” and the procedure of maintaining the equilibrium of the body-elements is the objective of this science.
The Complex of Disease-Factors
54. The complex of causes with reference to disease—psychic and somatic—is either erroneous, absent or excessive interaction between time, mind, senses and sense-objects.
The Two Resorts of Disease
55. The body and that which is called the mind are both considered to be the abodes of disease, likewise of well-being; the cause of well-being is their harmonious or concordant interaction.
The Nature of the Spirit
56. The spirit, which is changeless and transcendental, becomes the cause of consciousness when united with the mind, sense-objects and the senses. It is the eternal witness observing actions.
Somatic and Psychic Disease-Factors
57. Vata, pitta and kapha are said to be the complex of pathogenic factors in the body; and passion and delusion are considered to be the complex of pathogenic factors of the mind.
The Humors, their Qualities and Corrective Measures
58. The former type of morbidity is quieted by medications, divine and physical and the latter by spiritual Knowledge, philosophy, fortitude, remembrance and concentration.
59. The Vata is dry, cold, light, subtle, unstable, clear and rough; it is quieted by substances of the antagonistic qualities.
60. The Pitta is slightly unctuous, hot, acute, fluid, acid, mobile and pungent; it is readily quieted by substances of the antagonistic qualities.
61. The Kapha is heavy, cold, soft, unctuous, sweet, stable and viscid; it is quieted by substances of the antagonistic qualities.
62-62½. The disorders, classed as curable, disappear when treated with therapeutic agents of the antagonistic qualities, with due consideration to climate, dosage and time.
The treatment of incurable diseases is. however, not contemplated.
63. Now, a further description of qualities and actions with reference to individual substances will be given.
Taste, its Manifestation and Variety
64. Taste is the sense-object of the tongue; and source-substances for its general manifestation are the two proto-elements, water and earth; its variations are determined by the other three proto-elements, ether etc.
65. The group of tastes is described as the hexad of sweet, acid, salt, pungent, bitter and astringent tastes.
Taste in Relation to Humoral Provocation
66. The sweet, acid and salt tastes subdue the vata; the astringent, sweet and bitter tastes subdue the pitta; the astringent, pungent and bitter tastes subdue the kapha.
66(1). The pungent, acid and salt tastes provoke the pitta; the sweet, acid and salt tastes provoke the kapha; and pungent, bitter and astringent tastes provoke the vata.
Drugs; their Potency and Source
67. Substances are classified into three groups:—(1) some rectify the discordance of body-elements (2) some vitiate the body-elements, and (3) some are considered to be conducive to the maintenance of good health.
67. Again, they are classified differently into three groups as animal, vegetable and mineral.
Animal Substances
68-69. Honey, milk, bile, fat, marrow, blood, flesh, excrement, urine skin, semen, bone, sinews, horns, nails, hooves, hair, down and inspissated bile are the substances used in medicine from the animal world.
Mineral Substances
70. Gold, ores, the five metals, sand, lime, red and yellow arsenic, gems, salt, red ochre and antimony are the mineral products used in medicine.
The Vegetable Group
71. The vegetable group is divided into four classes—the direct fruiters, the creepers, the flowery fruiters and the herbs.
72. The direct fruiters bear fruit directly without passing through the flowering stage; the flowering fruiters are those which bear fruit after passing through the flowering stage; the herbs are the annuals namely, those that die just after seasonal fructification; and the creepers are those that creep or twine.
73. Root, bark, pith, exudation stalk, juice, sprouts, alkalis, milk, fruit, flower, ash, oils, thorns, leaves, buds, bulbs and off-shoots are the plantproducts used in medicine.
74-76. The rooters are said to be sixteen and the fruiters nineteen. The principal groups of unctuous substances are four; similarly the principal salts are five. The principal urines are eight in number, and eight are the principal milks. The trees prescribed for use by Punarvasu in the purification therapy are six in number. He only who, knows how to use all these indiseases, is the knower of the science.
The Sixteen Rooters, their Names and Actions
77-79. Oblong-leaved croton, white sweet flag, black-turpeth, turpeth, elephant creeper, soap-pod, white mussel shellcreeper, red physic-nut, colocynth, staff-plant, scarlet-fruited gourd, flax hemp, stinking swallow wort, wild carrot, physic-nut and hiritz are the sixteen rooters.
(1) Flax hemp, (2) scarlet fruited gourd and (3) white sweet flag are used as emetics.
(1) White mussel shell-creeper and (2) staff-plant are to be administered as errhines.
The Nineteen Fruiters, their Names and Actions
80. The remaining eleven are to be used as purgatives. Thus have been described the names and actions of the rooters.
81-851 Now listen to the names and actions of the fruiters.:—
(1) Clenolipis, (2) embelia. (3) bitter common cucumber, (4) emetic nut, (5) sponge gourd, (6) bottle gourd, (7) bristly luffa, (8) bitter luffa, (9-10) liquorice which is said to be of two kinds—aquatic and terrestrial, (11) Indian beech, (12) prickly brazil wood, (13) rough chaff tree, (14) chebulic myrobalan, (15) elephant creeper, (16) the autumnal fruits of Hastiparni (17) kamala, (18) Purging cassia and (19) kurchi. Of these, (1) sponge gourd, (2) bottle gourd, (3) bristly luffa, (4) bitter luffa, (5) emetic nut, (6) kurchi (7) the bitter common cucumber and (8) the fruits of the Hastiparni are used in emesis and corrective enema, while rough chaff is prescribed as errhine. The remaining ten are prescribed as purgatives. The names and actions of the nineteen fruiters have thus been described.
The Tetrad of Unctuous Substances
86. The principal groups of unctuous substances described as being four, are ghee, oil, fat and marrow. They are, each of them, used in combination with other drugs as potion, inunction, enemata and nasal medication.
They increase unctuousness, vitality, complexion, strength and plumpness. They are laid down as curatives of vata, pitta and kapha.
The Pentad of Salts
88. (1) The sanchala salt, (2) the Rock salt, (3) the bid salt, (4) the efflorescence salt and (5) the sea salt comprise the five principal kinds of salts.
89. They are unctuous, hot, acute and the foremost of digestive-stimulants.
90-91½. They are used, for external applications, in the oleation and sudatioi) therapies, in cleansing the upper and lower parts of the gastrointestinal tract, in evacuative and unctuous enemata and in inunction. They are used also as food, as errhine, in operative work, as suppository, as collyrium, in friction massage, in indigestion, in constipation, in disorders of vata and gulma, in colic, and in abdominal diseases. Thus has been described the use of salts.
The Octad of Urines
92-93½. Now listen to me as I describe the eight principal urines which are enumerated in the system of Atreya. They are the urines of the ewe, she-goat, cow, she-buffalo, cowelephant, she-camel, mare and she-ass.
94-94½. They are hot, acute, not ununctuous, pungent and saltish; and are used for friction massage and external application.
95-95½. They are also used in corrective enema, purgation and sudation and also in constipation and toxicosis;
96-96½. And in abdominal diseases, piles, gulma, dermatosis and in leprous lesions; also poultices and affusions.
97-97½. They are prescribed as digestive-stimulants,as antidotes to poison and as vermicides; they are also aids to be used as excellent remedies for persons affected with anemia.
98-99. When they are administered internally, they sedate the kapha, regulate the peristaltic movement of vata and draw pitta downwards. The actions of urines in general have thus been described by me; now they will be described individually.
100. The urine of the ewe is slightly bitter, unctuous and not antagonistic to pitta; the urine of the she-goat is astringent, sweet, wholesome and dispels the discordance of the humors.
101.The urine of the cow is slightly’ sweet, alleviative of humoral discordance to some extent and curative of helminthiasis and dermatosis; it relieves pruritus and, taken internally in the proper manner, is beneficial in abdominal diseases.
102.The urine of the she-buffalo is curative of piles, edema and abdominal diseases and is saltish and laxative, the urine of the cow-elephant is saltish; it is beneficial for those suffering from helminthiasis and dermatosis.
103. It is also recommended in cases of retention of feces and urine, in toxicosis, in disorders of kapha and in piles. The urine of the she-camel is said to be slightly bitter and curative of dyspnea, cough and piles.
104-104½. The urine of the mare is bitter and pungent and is curative of dermatosis, wounds and toxicosis. The urine of the she-ass is curative of epilepsy, insanity and seizures. Thus have been described the urines and their uses according to their actions.
The Octad of Milks
105-106. Now, we shall describe the milks, their actions and properties. The milk of the sheep, the goat, the cow, the buffalo, the camel, the elephant, the mare, and the woman are the eight principal varieties of milk.
107-109. Milk is said to be generally sweet, unctuous, cooling, galactogogue pleasing, roborant, aphrodisiac, brain-tonic, strengthening, exhilerating, vitalizing, refreshing, curative of dyspnea, cough ana hemothermia, a synthesizer in injuries, wholesome to all living creatures, sedative, purificative, adipsous, digestive, and most beneficial in emaciation due to pectoral lesions.
110-111. It is recommended in anemia and acid dyspepsia, consumption, Gulma, abdominal diseases, diarrhea, fever, burning and particularly in dropsy, in vaginal and seminal disorders, in oliguria, and in scybalous stools. It is wholesome to patients suffering from disorders of vata and pitta.
112. Milk is used in every way, namely, in nasal medications, external applications, baths, emesis, enemata, purgation and oleation therapy.
113. We shall give a further and exhaustive description of the action and uses of each of the milks in due order, in the chapter on Diet and Dietetics.
The Triad of Milky Plants and their Actions
114. We shall now describe three other plants, besides the fruiters and rooters:—the thorny milk-hedge plant, mudar and heart-leaved fig; their respective actions are as follows:—
115. The heart-leaved fig is used in emesis, and the milk of the thorny milk-hedge plant in purgation; and the the milk of the mudar, it should be known, is used both in emesis and purgation.
The Triad of Barks and their Actions
116. There, are three more plants whose bark is said to be useful in medicine, viz. The bonduc, drumstick and tilvaka.
117-118. The bonduc and tilvaka should be used in purgation; and the drum-stick in acute spreading affections, edema piles, ringworm, abscesses, swellings, dermatosis and boils. The wise physician should acquire the knowledge of these six purificatory plants as well.
119. Thus have been described the fruiters, the rooters, the unctuous subtances, the salts, the urines, the milks and the six plants whose milk and bark are used.
The Virtues of the Knowledge of Drugs
120. The goatherds, the shepherds and cowherds and other foresters are acquainted with the names and forms of plants.
121. No one can claim to have a perfect knowledge of the use of medicinal herbs by the mere acquaintance with the names or even with the forms of them.
122. If one who knows the uses and actions of herbs, though not acquainted with their forms, may be called a knower of the science, then -what need be said of the physician who has a knowledge of the herbs in all their aspects?
123. He is the best of physicians who knows the science of the administration of drugs with due reference to clime and season, and who applies it only after examining each and every patient individually.
The Evils of Ignorance
124. A drug that is not understood perfectly is comparable to poison, weapons, fire and the thunderbolt; while, the perfectly understood drug is comparable to ambrosia.
125. The drug whose name, form and properties are not known, or the drug which, though known, is not properly administered, will cause disaster.
126. Even acute poison is converted into an excellent medicine by the right method of preparation; while, even a good medicine may act as an acute poison if improperly administered.
127. Therefore, the intelligent man who desires health and long life, should not take any medicine prescribed by a physician who is a stranger to the art of application.
128. One may survive the fall of a thunderbolt on one’s head, but one cannot expect to escape the fatal effects of medicine prescribed by an ignorant physician.
129-130. The vainglorious charlatan who administers medicine, though ignorant of it, to the ailing bed-ridden patient who has implicit faith in him, is lost to all sense of duty and is sinful, wicked aud death incarnate. Even by converse with him does one fall into hell.
131-132. It is better for the person who has put on the garb of the physician to quaff the venom of the cobra or molten copper or to swallow heated iron balls than to extort food, drink or money from a man who is afflicted with disease and has sought his aid.
The Qualities of the Medical Man and of Medicine
133. Therefore the intelligent person who is aspiring to be a good physician should always persevere to his best in the acquisition of the true qualities of a physician, so that he may be a real giver of life to people.
The Right Medicine
134. That is the right medicine which makes for health; and he is the best of physicians who relieves people of disease.
The True Physician
135. Success in treatment signifies the correct application of all therapeutic measures, and success also indicates that the physician is a foremost one endowed with all the qualities of the physician.
Summary
Here are the recapitulatory verses:—
136. The advent of Ayurveda; the cause of its advent; its promulgation; the approbation of the aphoristic compilations; the definition of the science;
137. a complete definition of Cause and Action; the object of the Science of Life; etiology, pathology, and therapeutics in brief;
138. the tastes and the proto-elements as the cause of their manifestations; the three-fold classification of substances; the rooters and the fruiters, the unctuous substances,and the salts;
139. the urines, the milks, and the six plants whose milk and bark are used in medicine; the actions of all these; the merits and demerits of the right and wrong administration of them;
140. the denunciation of quacks; and what indicates the best qualities of the physician:—all these, have been fully expounded in the first chapter, by the great sage.
1. Thus, in the section on General Principles in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the first chapter entitled “The Quest for Longevity (Dirgha Jivita—dīrgha-jīvita)” is completed.
The Virtues of Errhination
3-6. The seeds of rough chaff (apamarga), long pepper, black pepper, embelia, drumstick, rape-seed, Indian tooth ache, cumin, wild carrot, toothbrush tree, cardamom, fragrant piper, black cumin, holy basil, white mussel shell creeper, shrubby basil, sweet marjoram, seeds of shirish, garlic, turmeric and Indian berberry, rock-salt, black salt, staff and dry ginger:—these should be given as errhines in conditions of heaviness of the head, head ache, coryza, hemicrania, parasitic infections of the head, epilepsy, anosmia and fainting;
Emetic Drugs
7-8. Emetic nut, liquorice, neem, bristly luffa, bitter luffa, long pepper, kurchi, bottle gourd, cardamom and sponge gourd:—these drugs should be used as emetics by the physician, in a way not harmful to the body, in gastro-genic disorders characterised by morbid accumulations of kapha and pitta.
Purgative Drugs
9-10. Turpeth, the three myrobalans, red physic nut, indigo, soap-pod, sweet flag, kamala, colocynth, hiritz prickly brazil wood, toothbrush tree purging cassia, grapes, physicnut, and hijjal:—these should be prescribed for purgation when the morbid humors have accumulated in the colon.
Drugs Used in Corrective and unctuous Enemata
11-13. Trumpet-flower, windkiller, bael, Indian calosanthes, white teak, tick trefoil, painted-leaved uraria, yellow-berried night-shade, heartleaved sida, small caltrops, Indian night-shade, hog’s weed, castor-oil plant, barley, horse-gram, jujube, guduch, emetic nut, palash [palasha], ginger grass, unctuous substances and salts should be used in misperistalsis and constipation, and in corrective enemata.
14. Out of these groups of drugs should be prepared unctuous enemata curative of vata. Thus, has been described, the compendium of the drugs required for the five purificatory procedures.
15. When the morbid humors have been aroused by the preliminary preparation of the patient with the oleation and sudation procedures, these five modes of purification should be earned out, with due consideration to dose and time.
The Virtue of Pharmaceutical Knowledge
16. The art of prescription depends on the knowledge of dosage and time, and on this art, in turn, depends success; hence, the skilful physician stands ever superior to those possessing merely a theoretical knowledge of drugs.
The Twenty-eight Gruels
17. Henceforth we shall expound the subject of various medicated gruels used for the relief of the various disorders that are curable.
18. The gruel prepared with long pepper, piper root, piper chaba, white flowered leadwort and dry ginger is a digestive-stimulant and pain-killer.
19. The gruel prepared with wood apple, bael, yellow-wood sorrel, buttermilk and pomegranate is digestive and astringent. The gruel prepared with penta radices should be given in diarrhea of the vata type.
20. The gruel prepared with tick trefoil, heart-leaved sida, bael and painted-leaved uraria, and acidified with pomegranate juice, is beneficial in diarrhea of the pitta or kapha type.

Summary
Here is the recapitulatory verse:—
34.Thus have been described the twenty eight gruels and the compendium of drugs pertaining to the quinary purificatory procedures.
35. The drugs that were described before with the object of imparting the knowledge of the rooters and the fruiters, are again mentioned here with the object of imparting the knowledge of drugs required in the five purificatory procedures.
36. The physician endowed with a good memory, well versed in diagnosis and the application of therapeutic agents, self-controlled and prompt in taking right decisions, is entitled to undertake treatment by prescribing these drugs.
2. Thus, in the section on General Principles in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the second chapter entitled “The Seeds of Rough Chaff (Apamarga-Tanduliya—apāmārga-taṇḍulīya)” is completed.
The Fifteen Applications in Dermatosis
3. (1) The Purging cassia (aragvadha) with the fetid cassia, Indian beech, vasaka, guduch, emetic nut, turmeric and Indian berberry; (2) pine-resin, deodar catechu, crane tree, neem, embelia and Indian oleander bark;

6. These six groups of drugs mentioned in each of the six distichs, when soaked in ox-bile and pounded again, have proved very efficacious. These powders should be prescribed by the physician to be used as external applications mixed with rape-seed oil.
7. These when administered, quickly cure persons of obstinate skin diseases, recent leprous lesions, alopecia, keloids, ringworm, fistula-in-ano, piles, scrofula and papules.
8. Costas, turmeric and Indian berberry, holy basil, wild snake gourd, neem, winter cherry, deodar, drumstick, rape-seed, Indian toothache, coriander, rush nut and angelica the powders of these should be taken in equal quantity.
9. They should be rubbed into paste with buttermilk and rubbed over the body which has been previously smeared with oil; this gives relief in pruritus, pimples, wheals, dermatosis and edema.
10. Costus, blue vitriol, Indian berberry, green vitriol, kamala, nut grass lodh, sulphur, yellow resin, embelia, red and yellow arsenics and oleander bark:—
11. These should be pulverised and used as dusting powders over the parts previously anointed with oil. It relieves ringworm, pruritus, keloids, papules and bullous eruption.

17. The ointment, prepared of the leaves of purging cassia or black night-shade or Indian oleander and buttermilk, should be rubbed over the skin lesions of the person who has been previously anointed with oil.
The Five Applications in vata
18. Indian jujube, horse gram, deodar, Indian groundsel, black gram linseed, oil-seeds, costus, sweet flag, dill and barley flour—these, acidified and warmed, make a good application for those afflicted with vata disorders.
19. The warm application of the minced and prepared flesh of wetland animals and fishes will cure vata-disorders; the application of decaradices and drugs of the fragrant group, prepared in the tetrad of unctuous-substances, cures vata-disorders.
20. Barley powder and alkali mixed with buttermilk, and administered warm, relieves pain in the stomach. Costus, dill, sweet flag and barley-flour, mixed with oil and acid articles are prescribed in vata-disorders.
The Five in Rheumatic Conditions

29.Rubbing the body well with the powder of shiris, geranium grass, fragrant poon and lodh cures morbidity of the skin and hyperhidrosis; the salve of cinnamon leaves, fragrant sticky mallow, lodh, cuscus grass, and sandalwood removes body fetor.
Summary
Here is the recapitulatory verse:—
30. Here in this chapter entitled “The Purging Cassia”, the son of Atri, revered of the great sages of attainment, has described for the good of the world, the thirty-two most efficacious powders and unguents that are dispellers of manifold diseases.
3. Thus, in the Section on General Principles, in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the third chapter entitled “the Purging Cassia (Aragvadha—āragvadha)” is completed.
Their Six Sources
5. There are six sources of purgative preparations (Virecana-Ashraya) namely, milk, root, bark, leaves, flowers and fruits of plants.
The five substrata of Decoctives
6. The substrata of decoctives from five categories of taste as described in this text, are the decoctives belonging to the categories of sweet, acid, bitter, pungent and astringent tastes. (The salt taste is excluded.)
The Five Modes of their Preparation
7.-(1) There are five modes of pharmaceutical preparation of these decoctives, viz., expressed juice, paste, decoction, cold infusion and hot infusion.
7.-(2) The fresh juice extracted by mechanical pressure from a herb is called ‘expressed juice.’ The soft mass prepared by rubbing the drug along with its juice is known as paste. The physicians give the name of “decoction” to that fluid which is obtained by boiling over a fire.
7.-(3) That is called cold infusion which is obtained by crushing a drug and keeping it overnight in boiled water; and that is called hot infusion which is obtained from a crushed drug by pouring hot water over it.
7.-(4) The potency of each of these five preparations is superior to its succeeding one i. e., each preceding one is more powerful than the succeeding one. Hence the preparation should. be so made as to accord with the strength of the disease as well as with that of the patient. Hence, any and every preparation may not be made use of, in any and every case indiscriminately.

The innumerability of Possible Decoctives and the Medium Course of Exposition
19. This is the exposition of the five hundred decoctives classified into fifty principal groups of decoctives with a view to illustrate their actions.
20.-(l) While there is no limit to the number of possible dec actives, too brief an enumeration would not be of help to the physician of limited intelligence; therefore it is, that we have given an enumeration that is neither too brief nor too extensive.
20-(2) This is quite adequate for the mediocre for the practical purpose of treatment; and for the highly intelligent who are proficient in the art of inference from innate qualities, it will serve as a guiding principle for the comprehensive knowledge of drugs not mentioned here.
Five Hundred Decoctives in All
21. To the worshipful Atreya who had thus spoken, Agnivesha said “O Lord! these five hundred decoctives do not comprise five-hundred drugs, because some common constituent decoctives keep recurring in these principal groups.
22. The worshipful Atreya replied to him “O Agnivesha! the wise should not see things in that light. Though single, a thing may have many appellations owing to its diverse actions.
22.-(2) Thus a man is able to perform various actions. He is given that particular appellation which is characteristic of the actions which he does, either as an agent or instrument or doer. The same thing is observed in the case of drugs.
22.-(3) If we could indeed find any one drug possessed of all the properties, and capable of meeting all requirements, who would then put himself to the trouble of committing to memory or imparting to his disciples the names and qualities of any other drugs?
Summary
23. Here are the recapitulatory verses—
Here are described in brief the 600 purgative preparations, the names of the drugs and the number of preparations from each of them, as well as the six sources of these drugs.
24. The preparations made from articles of all the categories of taste except the salt, are called decoctives; hence, the substrata of decoctives is said to be of five kinds.
25. Similarly, the mode of preparation of these is described as of five kinds; the fifty principal groups of decoctives are also enumerated.
26. Five hundred decoctives are severally described for illustration; there is no limit to the expansion of the subject.
27-28. Over-brevity will not do for, it will not be of help to mediocres; therefore neither an over-brief nor an over-extensive description is given; and this will be of practical use to mediocres and aid the enhancement of the knowledge of the talented; thus the fifty-fold classification of decoctives has been described.
29. He is the best of physicians, who knows the art of combination as well as the systematic administration of these preparations, both internally and externally.
30. Thus, in the section on General Principles, in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the fourth chapter entitled Six hundred Purgative Preparations (Virecana-Ashraya—virecana-āśraya), is completed.
Thus ends the tetrad of chapters on drugs.
Measure Relative to the Gastric Fire
3. One must eat in measure (Matrashin—mātrāśin) and the measure of food is determined by the strength of one’s gastric fire.
The Measure of food
4. That should be known as the proper measure of food which, when-taken, is digested in due time without impairing one’s health.
The Measures of heavy and Light Articles
5.-(1) In view of this, shali rice, shashtika rice, green gram, common quail, grey partridge, antelope, rabbit, wapiti, Indian sambar and such other articles of food, though light by nature, need to be taken in measure.
5.-(2) Similarly pastry, sugarcane juice, milk, til, black gram, the flesh of aquatic and wetland animals and other similar articles of food, though heavy by nature, are also to be taken in measure.
6.-(1) However, from the above classification, one should not conclude that heaviness or lightness in an article of food is mentioned without reason. The light articles contain predominance of the qualities of air and fire.
6.-(2) The others, the heavy ones, contain more of the properties of earth and water. Consequently, the light articles are stimulative of the gastric fire owing to their innate quality and are considered to be least harmful even if they are eaten to a surfeit.
6.-(3) On the other hand, the heavy articles are by nature non-stimulative of the gastric fire owing to their dissimilar nature.
6.-(4) A surfiet-meal of them is markedly harmful unless the gastric fire is increased by hard exercise.
6.-(5) Thus the measure in food depends upon the strength of the gastric fire.
7. It is not that the quantity of a substance does not count. From the point of view of quantity, it is laid down that heavy articles should be taken in one-third or one half measure of the full meanwhile even light articles should not be taken in excess and should accord with the strength of the gastric fire.
The Virtues of Measured Diet
8. The measured diet not only does not impair one’s health but positively promotes one’s strength, complexion, health and life.
The Measure of Articles of Pastry
Here are verses again—
9. One should never, accordingly, eat such heavy articles as pastry flattened rice, etc., on top of a meal. Even while hungry, one should take such articles in right measure.
The andes of Diet to Be Eschewed
10. Dried meat, dried vegetables, lotus rhizomes and lotus stalk, being heavy, are not to be taken habitually, nor should the flesh of an emaciated animal be used.
11. Coagulated milk, cream cheese, pork,cow’s and buffalo’s flesh, fish, curds, black gram and wild barley should not be used habitually.
The Articles of Diet to Be Practised
12.Shashtika rice, shali rice, green gram, rock-salt, emblic myrobalan barley, rain water, milk, ghee, flesh of jangala animals and honey may be habitually taken.
Hygiene in Brief
13. That should form the daily diet, which not only helps to maintain present well-being, but serves as a prophylactic against coming disease.
The Use of Collyrium
14. From here onwards, keeping in view the art of healthful living, we shall explain the personal regimen including such observances as painting the eyes with eye-salves, with reference to its benefits.
15. The antimony-collyrium which is beneficial to the eyes should be used daily and the extract of Indian beberry should be used once in every fifth or eighth night for the drainage of the eyes.
16. The eye is of the element of light. So, it is specially liable to be adversely affected by kapha i.e. watery element. Therefore measures curative of kapha are beneficial in keeping the vision clear.
16½-17½. Strong collyrium should not be applied to the eyes during day time, because the eye sight, weakened by drainage, gets impaired on exposure to sunshine. Therefore, the draining by collyrium is indicated exclusively by night.
18-19½. Just as various kinds of tarnished gold ornaments etc. get cleansed by being washed with oil, cloth, brush etc., even so, by the use of eye-salves, eye drops etc, in the eyes, the vision of mortals shines brightly like the moon in the clear sky.
The Articles Used in the Smoking Bougie and the Method of Preparing Cigars
20-24½. Fragrant piper, perfumed cherry, great cardamom, fragrant poon, shell, fragrant stickly mallow, sandal-wood, cinnamon leaf, cinnamon bark, cardamom, cuscus grass, Himalayan cherry, ginger grass, liquorice, nardus. gum guggul [guggula], eagle wood, sugar, barks of the banyan, gular fig and holy fig trees, and of yellow barked fig tree and lodh tree, rushnut sarja sal, sal resin, nut grass, lichen, lotus, blue water lily, pine resin, olibanum and angelica:—all these should be ground and made into a paste by the physician. It should then be plastered over a piece of reed and moulded into cigar resembling the shape of a barley-grain, and having the thickness of the thumb and a length of eight fingers’ breadth. When it is dried, the central reed should be pulled out, and the cigar put into the smoking pipe and smeared with unctuous substance. It should then be ignited and smoked at leisure as a habitual smoke.
Articles Used in the Unctuous Cigar
25-25⅛. Preparing a c:gar from animal fat, ghee and wax combined skilfully with the best drugs of the sweet group, one should use it for unctuous smoke.
Articles Used in Errhine-Smoke
26-23½. The smoke of white mussel shell creeper, staff plant, yellow arsenic, red arsenic, eagle-wood, cinnamon leaf and other perfumes, acts as errhine.
The Virtues of Smoking
27-31½. Heaviness in the head, headache, rhinitis, hemicrania, earache, eye-ache, cough, hiccup, dyspnea, throat-spasm, weakness of the teeth, discharge from the ear, nose and eye due to morbid condition, nasal and oral fetor, dentalgia, anorexia, rigidity of jaw and neck, pruritus, worms, pallor of the face, mucoid discharge from the mouth, cacophonia, Galashundi, Upajihvika, alopecia, greyness, falling of hair, sternutation, excessive torpor, stupefaction of the mind and hyper somnia:—all these are alleviated by smoking, and the strength of the hair, bones of the head, sense-organs and voice becomes augmented.
32-32½. Those who resort to oral smoking will not be troubled even by severe vata and kapha, or disorders affecting the supra clavicular part of the body or the head.
The Eight Proper Times for Smoking
33-33½. Eight specified times are laid down for habitual smoking, because during these periods, the rise of vata and kapha is observed.
34-34½. That is: after taking the bath, after tongue-scraping, after sneezing, tooth cleansing, nasal toilet and the use of eye-salve and at the end of sleep, the self-controlled man should resort to smoking.
35-35½. Thereby, the vata and kapha-born diseases affecting the upper supraclavicular parts of the body, do not afflict him. Smoking should be done thrice, in three puffs each time,

The Method of Cleaning the Teeth and its Virtues
71-71½. A green tooth-twig which is crushed at the proximal end and is of the astringent, pungent or bitter taste, should be used twice a day without injuring the gums.

87. The vata is the prodominant element in the sense of touch; and the sense of touch resides in the skin. Inunction is the greatest dermic tonic; therefore, a person ought to practise it daily.
88. A person’s limbs accustomed to daily inunction are not liable to be affected seriously by injury due to external trauma or by violent exertion.
89. By daily inunction a person becomes smooth in his limbs and plump, strong and good looking, and escapes the effects of age.

5. Thus, in the section on General Principles, in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the fifth chapter entitled “Measure in eating (Matrashitiya or Matrashita—mātrāśitīya or mātrāśita)” is completed.
The Regimen of Man
1. We shall now expound the chapter entitled “the Seasonal dietary and Regimen of Man (Tasyashita or Tasyashitiya—tasyāśita or tasyāśitīya).”
2. Thus declared the worshipful Atreya.
Seasonal Homologation
3. The seasonal dietary and regimen (Tasyashita) practised by a man who knows the seasonal homologation with regard to behaviour and diet, promote his vigor and complexion.
The Seasonal Divisions of the Year
4. Now the year, it should be known, consists of six parts when divided according to the seasons. From among these, the three seasons from the dewy season to the summer represent the suns northern course and his period of absorption; while the three seasons from the rains to the winter represent the sun’s southern course and his period of liberation.
Seasonal Characteristics
4. (1) During the period of liberation, the prevailing winds are not marked by excessive dryness; it is otherwise with the period of absorption. During the former, the moon with unabated vigor aggrandizes the earth by surcharging it with her cool radiations and nourishes it constantly; therefore, the period of liberation is characterised by the predominance of the water element. On the other hand, the period of absorption is characterised by the predominance of the fire element.
5. In this manner, the sun, the wind and the moon, governed by time as well as their own special natures and orbits, are spoken of as the causative factors of the manifestation of the periods, seasons, tastes, humors and bodily strength.
The Debilitating Effect of the Season of absorption
6. During the first period, the sun with his hot rays absorbs the moisture from the earth, and the piercing dry winds further dehydrate it; thus the sun and the winds, giving rise to progressive dryness and promoting the formation of the three dry tastes, bitter astringent and pungent respectively, lead to the gradual waning of strength in men.
The Strengthening Effect of the Season of Release
7. From the season of the rains to the autumn and the winter, however, the sun who has set his face to the south, being shorn of his glory by the cumulative influence of the period, orbit, clouds, winds and rains, the moon remaining undiminished in power, and the summer heat having been quenched with the descent of rain, the tastes sour, salt and sweet, increase in the given order. During this period, the strength of man waxes.
The Developing Order of the Two Seasons
8. In the beginning and the end of the sun’s period of liberation and absorption respectively, the bodily vigor of men is at its lowest; in the middle of these periods, it is moderate; while, it should be known, that at the end of the former and the beginning of the latter period, the bodily vigor is at its highest,
The Regimen During the Winter
9. In the cold season or winter, the gastric fire in strong men, hemmed in by the cold air. all rounds, becomes greatly enhanced and capable of digesting heavy food intake, both as regards measure and quality of the articles.
10, If such a gastric fire does not get sufficient amount of fuel, then it consumes the bodyfluids and thus the vata, possessed of cold quality, is provoked in the cold season.
The Regimen During the Dewy Season
11. Hence in the season of the snows, i.e. winter, one should take unctuous, acid and salt juices of the flesh of fatty animals of the aquatic and wet land groups.
12. One should take the spit-roasted flesh of the burrowing and the tearer groups of animals, followed by a potion of madira and seedhu wines and honey.
13. One who uses habitually in winter milk, preparations. of sugarcane juice, animal fat, oil, new rice, and warm water, protects his life-span from diminution.
14. One should resort to inunction, oil massage, oil shampoo, hot house sudation, sun-baths, warm cellars and warm inner apartments in winter.
15. In the cold season, one should have vehicles, beds and seats well covered, and seats with thick quilts and deer skin or tiger skin, silk sheet, gunny cloth sheets or with variegated blankets.
16-17. when winter begins, one should always wear warm and thick clothing and should have one's body anointed with thick paste of eagle wood. Lying in bed with a plump and passionate woman of broad and well-filled breasts, who has anointed herself with the paste of eagle-wood, one should, warmed up by aphrodisiac wines, spend the night in her embraces. In the season of winter, one may indeed indulge in sexual enjoyment to one’s heart’s content.
18. On the advent of the cold season, one should give up eats and drinks that are light and provocative, of vata, and should avoid draughts, restricted diet and diluted demuilcent [demulcent?] drinks.
19-19½. Winter and the dewy season are similar in nature; yet there is a slight distinguishing characteristic in the dewy season, namely, the dryness born of the sun’s absorbing period and the cold born of clouds, wind and rain.
20-21. Therefore, the entire regimen prescribed in winter is to be observed in the dewy season as well. In fact, the rule as to residence in draughtless and warm apartments is to be observed even more stringently in the dewy season. One should avoid eats and drinks that are pungent, bitter, astringent, provocative of vata, light and cold.
The Regimen During the Spring
22. The accumulated kapha, getting liquefied by the hot rays of the sun in the spring, affects the body-heat and thus gives rise to many diseases.
23. Therefore, in the spring, purificatory procedures such as emesis ets., should be performed and one should avoid heavy, acid, unctuous and sweet articles, as also day sleep.
24. On the advent of the spring, one should resort to physical exercise, dry massage, smoking, gargles, collyrium and frequent ablutions with genially warm water.
25. One should anoint one’s body with sandal wood paste, eat a meal prepared of barley or wheat, flesh of wapiti, rabbit, Indian antelope, grey quail and grey partridge.
26. One should drink wholesome seedhu or honey wine and enjoy the youthful loveliness of women and the woods.
The Regimen During the Summer
27 In summer, the sun drinks up the unctuous element of the earth. During this season, therefore, foods and drinks that are sweet, cool, liquid, and unctuous are conducive to health.
28. By recourse to a diet of cold demulcent drink mixed with sugar, the flesh of animals and birds of the jangala group, ghee, milk and shali rice, one escapes the enervating effects of the season.
29. Little or.no wine should be drunk or it should be drunk diluted liberally-with water. One should, further, give up foods that are salt, sour pungent and hot, as also exercise.
30. Smearing oneself with sandal paste, one should court sleep by day in the cool apartment of the house, and, by night, on the terrace cooled by the rays of the moon and open to the breezes.
31. Adorned with pearls and gems, one should seek the couch, being ministered to by the waving of fans and by the caresses of tender hands which are cool with sandal water.
32. In the summer season, one should abstain from sexual intercourse, and seek the coolness of the woods, waters and flowers.
The Regimen During the Rains
33. In the body that has been impoverished, by. the effects of the sun during his period of absorption, the digestive power too grows weak. On the advent of the rainy season, the digestive power readily succumbs to the morbid effects of vata and other humors.
34-34½. The humors in their turn, finding the strength of the gastric fire weakened, get provoked aided by the effects of moist—hot exhalations from the earth, the precipitation of the rains and the tendency to acidity in water that occurs in the rainy season. Accordingly, the general rule, that is. laid down for the rainy season is moderation.
35-36. One should, in particular, avoid watery demulcent drink, daysleep, frosts, river-water, exercise, sun and sexual intercourse during this season. One should, as a rule, take foods and drinks that are well seasoned, iu combination with honey.
37. On very cold days marked by stormy winds and rain, one should, even in the rainy season, take unctuous articles with pronounced acid and salt tastes, for the sake of alleviating vata.
38. Taking care to preserve one’s gastric fire, one should take old barley, wheat and shali-rice together with the flesh and well-seasoned soups of the jangala-group of animals.
39. One should drink, mixed with honey, a small measure of decocted honey-wine or rain-water, well-water or lake-water that has been boiled and cooled.
40. In the rains, one should have recourse to friction-massage, dry massage, bathing, wearing of perfumes and garlands, light and clean habiliments, residing in the rain-house i.e., house designed for residing in the rains free from damp.
41. When the body which has become habituated to the cold of the rains, is suddenly heated by the rays of the sun in the autumn, the accumulated pitta in the body is generally provoked.
42. In this season one should partake of eats and drinks that are sweet, light, cooling, slightly bitter, and curative of pitta, in due dose and when really, hungry.
The Regimen During the Autumn
43. In the beginning of the autumn, one should take the flesh of grey quail, grey partridge, black buck, wild sheep, wapiti and hare, shali rice, barley and wheat.
44. When the rain clouds have disappeared, one should resort to a potion of ghee medicated with bitter articles, to purgation and to depletion of blood, and one should avoid exposure to the sun.
45. One should avoid, in this season animal fats, oils, exposure to frosts, flesh of aquatic and wet land animals, alkalis, curds, day-sleep and easterly winds.
The Nature of the ‘Hasmodaka’, the Celestial Water
46-47. The water of the autumn which is well heated by the rays of the sun during the day and well cooled by the rays of the moon by night, ripened and freed from impurities by the course of Time and detoxicated by the radiations of the star Agastya (Canopus), and which is clear and pure, is called Hamsodaka i.e. pure water which is beloved of the swans. This autumnal water is crystal clear and clean, and the use of this water for bathing, drinking or immersion is as beneficial to the body as ambrosia.
48. Garlands of autumnal flowers, spotless garments and exposure to moonlight in the early part of the night are recommended in the autumnal season.
The Nature of Homologation
49. Thus has been described the seasonal homologation with reference to behaviour and diet. That which becomes homologatory by habitual use is said to be “acquired homologation.”
50. The knowers of the principles of homologation consider it desirable to acquire homologation regarding food and behaviour to things which are antagonistic to the characteristics of the country and the causative factors of the diseases prevalent there.
Summary
Here is the recapitulatory verse:—
51. In this chapter entitled “The seasonal Dietary of Man,” has been explained with reasons, what should be and what should not be used by a man in each season, as also the principle of homologation.
6. Thus, in the section on General Principles in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the sixth chapter entitled “The Seasonal Dietary and Regimen of Man (Tasyashitiya or Tasyashitiya—tasyāśita or tasyāśitīya)” is completed.

38. By gradual withdrawal, addictions do not revert and wholesome habits, gradually acquired, become firmly implanted.
Men that are Always or Never Ailing
39. From the moment of conception some men are equibalanced as regards the three humors, vata, pitta and kapha; some have a predominance of vata, some of pitta and some of kapha.
The Nature of Habitus
40. Of them the first alone enjoy perfect health, while the rest are ever liable to disease. Their body habit is is named according to the continual predominance of a particular humor in the body.
The Homologation to All Tastes Equally of the healthy Man
41. Having regard to the rules of healthful living in the case of those who are characterised by the predominance of one humor, the use of things antagonistic in quality to that particular humor is beneficial; while in the case of persons with equibalanced humors, the balanced use of the articles of all tastes is recommended as being homologatory to them.
The Excretory passages
42. There are two excretory orifices in the lower part of the trunk; there are seven cavities in the head and innumerable openings of sweat-glands all over the body; the emunctories are impaired by morbid or excessive formation of excretory products.
The Signs of the increase and Decrease of Excretion
43. The excessive or scanty formation of the excretory products is known by the enlargement or contraction of the emunctory concerned, as also by excessive discharge or suppression of the excrement.
The Treatment of Diseases thereof
44. Diagnosing these disorders by their characteristic signs and morbidity, the physician should treat curable diseases by remedies which are antagonistic to the diseases and their causative factors, with due consideration to dose and time.
The Object of Practising the Wholesome Conduct
45. These and other diseases occur in those who do not observe the rules of healthful living. Hence, the healthy man should be diligent in the observance of the rules of healthful living.
The Method of Warding off Endogenous Diseases
46. One should eliminate the accumulated morbid matter in the months of Caitra, Shravana and Margashirsha.
47. The wise physician should, after preliminary preparation of the body with the oleation and sudation procedures, carry out the purificatory procedures of emesis, purgation, enemata and errhines, according to the season.
48. Thereafter, the physician skilled in the science of climatology should administer alterative and virilific remedies of tested efficacy systematically and as indicated.
49. Thus, the body-elements being restored to the normal state, susceptibility to disease disappears, the body-elements get aggrandized and the pace of age is slackened.
50 Such is the procedure laid down for the prevention of the endogenous diseases. As regards the prevention of other types of diseases, we shall instruct separately.
Volitional transgression the Cause of Exogenous Diseases
51. The exogenous diseases of human beings, proceeding from evil spiritis, poison, air, fire, trauma and such other things, are due to “volitional transgression.”
52. The psychic disorders, such as jealousy, grief, fear, anger, vanity, hatred and such others, are also said to be the result of “volitional transgression.”
The Method of Warding off Exogenous Diseases
53. Avoidance of “volitional transgression” control of the senses, recollection, knowledge of clime, season and the self, and observance of the rules of good conduct—
54. These are laid down as the course of prevention of exogenous diseases. The wise man should observe, much before the onset of disease, as a prophylactic measure, such things as he considers good for his well-being.
55. The knowledge of authoritative instruction and its right application are the two factors necessary for the prevention and cure of diseases.
Avoidable Men
56-57. Those who are sinful of conduct, speech and disposition, backbiters, quarrelsome, sarcastic and niggards; those who are envious of others’ prosperity, and cheats; those who delight in scandal-mongering and are fickle-minded, those who have a foot in the enemy’s camp, those who are without compunction, and apostates; all such, the scum of humanity, should be shunned.
Associable men
58-59. While those who are mature in understanding, learning, years, character, courage, memory and one-mindedness; those who frequent the company of such; those who are endowed with insight into the nature of things; those who are free from all ailments; those who are well-disposed towards all creatures; those who are tranquil of heart; those who are of commendable character; the teachers of the right path; and those who hear and see only that which is meritorious, are to be sought.
One Should Strive in Wholesome-practices
60. The wise man who seeks happiness both here and hereafter, should exercise the highest care in selecting what is wholesome in the matter of food, conduct and behaviour.
Directions in the Use of Cruds
61. Curds should not be taken at night nor should they be taken without ghee and sugar, nor without green-gram soup, nor without honey, nor hot, nor without emblic myrobalans.
The Evils of Violating these Directions
62. The curds-lover who violates these rules would be affected with fever, hemothermia, acute spreading affections, dermatosis, anemia giddiness and severe jaundice.
Summary
63. Here are the recapitulatory verses—
The natural urges (vega), the diseases born of their suppression, their treatment, the urges that should be controlled, what is wholesome and what is unwholesome and for whom;
64. the withdrawal from bad habits and the development of good habits, diet according to habitus; diseases of the emunctories and their medication;
65. prophylactic measures for the prevention of diseases; who are to be shunned and who are to be sought by the wise man, who is keen on achieving his welfare;
66. In what way curds should be taken and why so—all this the son of Atri has described in this chapter entitled “Natural Urges should not be suppressed.”
7. Thus in the section on General Principles in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the seventh chapter entitled “Natural Urges (vega) should not be suppressed” is completed.
The Description of the Senses
3. According to this science, there are five sense-faculties (Pancendriya—pañcendriya), five sense-materials (Pancendriya-dravya—pañcendriya-dravya), five sense-organs (Pancendriya-adhishthana—pañcendriya-adhiṣṭhāna), five sense-objects (Pancendriya-artha—pañcendriya-artha) and five sense-perceptions (Pancendriya-buddha—pañcendriya-buddha). Thus it has been laid down on the subject of the senses (indriya).
The indication of the Mind
4. The mind which is super-sensual is designated “Sattva” or Psyche and some call it “Cetah” [Cetas] (consciousness). Its function is dependent on the presence of the mental object and the spirit. It is the cause of the activity of the sense-organs.
The Cause for A Variety of Manifestations in one and the Same Mind
5. On account of the multiplicity of mental objects, sense-objects and impulses, as also of the combinations of the qualities of Rajas, Tamas and Sattva, the mind appears as multi faceted in one and the same person. There is no multiplicity of minds, because a single mind cannot have contact with many sense objects simultaneously. Hence, all sense-organs do not function at one and the same moment.
The Determination of the Sattvic and Other Temperaments
6. Whatever trait manifests most frequently in a man’s mental make up, of that mentality he is said to be by the wise, on account of his predominant association with it.
Perception Possible only for Senses Linked to the Mind
7. The sense-organs when led by the mind, are capable of contacting the sense-objects.
The Five Sense-Faculties
8. Sight, hearing, smell, taste and touch are the five sense faculties?
The Five Sense-Materials
9. The five sense-materials are ether, air, light, water and earth.
The Five Sense-Organs
10. The five sense-organs are the eyes, the cars, the nose, the tongue and the skin.
The Five Sense-Objects
11. The five sense-objects are sound, touch, shape, taste and smell.
The Five Perceptions
12. The five perceptions are the visual perception etc. These perceptions are the results of the coordination of the senses, sense-objects (Indriyartha—indriyārtha), mind and soul; they are fleeting and are of the nature of decisions. These then are the five pentads.
The Aggregate of spiritual Elements
13. The mind, the mind-objects, the understanding and the spirit constitute the aggregate of spiritual elements and qualities. This aggregate is the source of good or bad activity or inactivity. Action which is also called Therapeusis, depends on the substance.
The Designation of the Senses by their Predominant Composition
14. Although the senses, which are recognised by means of inference, are in general aggregates of all the five proto-elements, yet light in the eye, ether in the ear, earth in the smell, water in the taste, and air in the touch are found to predominate.
14-(1). From among these, each sense, predominant in one element in particular, contacts objects which have a similar predominance of that element, owing to innate affinity and ubiquity.
Causes for the Impairment and Enhancement of Understanding
15. By over-contact, non-contact and mis-contact of the senses with their objects, the senses, together with the mind, getting vitiated, lead to the impairment of understanding in their own respective spheres. On the other hand right contact, regaining the normal state, conduces to the enhancement of understanding in due manner.
The Object of the Mind
16. The object of the mind is that which is thinkable. The right, as well as excessive, deficient and erroneous perceptions are the causes respectively, of the order and the disorder of the mind and understanding.
Preservation of the Normalcy of the Mind
17-(1). For preserving the normality of the sense-organs and the mind, and for protecting them from abnormality, effort should be made by the following means.
17-(2). The wholesome contact of the sense-organs and their objects, the proper performance of actions after intelligent and repeated scrutiny, and resorting to the habitual use of agents that counteract the prevailing traits of clime, season and one’s own constitution.
17-(3). Therefore, all those desirous of their welfare should always remember and put into practice all the rules of right conduct.
The Objects of the Good Life
18-(1). By the observance of these rules, one achieves at once both the objects viz. health and the conquest of the senses (indriyavijaya).
18-(2). O, Agnivesha! we shall now describe the entire code of right conduct.

Summary
Here are the recapitulatory verses:—
30. In this chapter entitled “The discipline of the senses (indriya-upakrama)” are related the five pentads, the mind, the tetrad of causes, and the regimen of good conduct in detail.
31. He who rightly observes the rules of health laid down here will not be deprived of the full measure of the hundred years of diseaseless life.
32. The man, approved of good men, fills the world of mortals with his fame, attains both wealth and spiritual merit and becomes the friend of all creatures.
33. He of virtuous deeds, attains the supreme world of the doers of good. Therefore, this regimen should always he observed by all.
Atreya’s Opinion on the Subject
34. Whatever other observances there may be that are not spoken of here, provided they are good, are always to be respected, in the opinion of Atreya,
8. Thus, in the section on General Principles, in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the eighth chapter entitled “The Discipline of the Senses (indriya-upakrama)”, is completed.
2. Thus, the second tetrad of chapters concerning healthful living is completed.
The Definition of Health and of Disease
4. The discordance of body-elements is called disease, and their concordance is said to be normal health. Being characterised by a sense of ‘ease’ is the state of freedom from disease; while disease is always of the nature of pain.
The Definition of Therapeusis
5. Therapeusis is the name given to the combined operation of the four factors viz. the physician and the other three factors of commendable qualities with the object of bringing about the concordance of body-elements, when pathological changes have occurred in them.
The Qualifications of a physician
6. Clear grasp of theoretical knowledge, wide practical experience, skill and purity of body and mind: these are to be known as the tetrad of desiderata in a physician.
The Desiderata as Regards Drugs
7. Abundance, applicability, usability in multifarious modes and richness of quality—these four are said to be the tetrad of cesiderata as regards drugs.
The Qualifications in a Nurse
8. Knowledge of nursing, skill, affection for the master (patient) and cleanliness—these four are the tetrad of desiderata in the attendant.
The Qualifications in A Patient
9. Recollection, obedience to instructions, courage and ability to describe his ailments are considered the tetrad of desiderata in a patient.
The foremost Place of the Physician
10. The four basic factors, endowed with the above-mentioned sixteen qualities (comprising the four tetrads of desiderata) are responsible for success in treatment. Of these four, the physician occupies the chief place, being at once the knower of disease and drugs, the instructor of the attendant and patient and prescriber of medicine and regimen.
11-12. As the utensils, fuel and fire are to a cook in cooking, or as the terrain, army and weapon are to a conqueror in obtaining victory, so are the other three factors in relation to the physician in accomplishing the cure. Hence is the physician the foremost factor in treatment.
13. As the clay, rod, string, wheel, etc, are ineffective in the absence of the potter, so do the three other factors of treatment, in the absence of the physician, fail to accomplish the cure.
14-14½. The other three factors being given, if serious diseases, demanding attention and treatment, are sometimes seen to vanish like “a city of illusion” and at other times to get aggravated, the cause is to be found in the physician who is wise in the first instance and ignorant in the second instance.
The Risks attendant upon Treatment by A Quack
15-18. It is better for the quack to offer himself up in the fire than enforce his treatment (cikitsa) on the patient. Like a blind man groping about with his hands in fearful uncertainty, or like a rudderless canoe left to the mercy of the winds, the ignorant physician proceeds in his work full of uncertainty and fear.
17. Emboldened by meeting with providential success in his treatment of a patient destined to survive, the pretentious quack hastens to death a hundred others whose tenure of life is not so definite.
18. Hence, the physician who possesses the fourfold accomplishment consisting of theoretical knowledge, clear.interpretation, right application and practical experience, is to be regarded as the redeemer of life.
19. He, who possesses the fourfold knowledge of etiology, symptomatology, therapeutics and prophylaxis of diseases, is the best of physicians and deserves to be honored by the king. He alone is fit for being the royal physician.
20. Weapons, learning and water are wholly dependent for their merits and demerits on their holder. Hence, it is the understanding that should first of all be rendered immaculate and worthy of holding the knowledge of medicine.
21. Knowledge, imagination, comprehension, memory, promptness and action; for him who possesses these six qualities, there is no curable disease that cannot be cured.
22. Knowledge, intelligence, experience, practice, accomplishment and guidance: any single one out of these suffices to give its possessor the name of. “physician”.
23. Hence, one who has all these good qualities, knowledge etc., deserves the prefix of “good” before “physician” and he becomes a benefactor of humanity.
The Duty of the Physician
24. The science is the light for elucidation; the vision is one’s own intellect. Thy physician, well endowed with both, errs not in treatment.
25. In as much as the other three factors in treatment are dependent on himself, the physician must ever strive to enrich his qualities.
The Physician’s Conduct
26. Friendship towards all, compassion for the ailing, devotion to curable patients, and sense of resignation towards the dying constitute the four-fold nature of the physician’s profession.
Summary
Here are a couple of recapitulatory verses—
27. The fourfold basic factors of treatment, each again fourfold in itself; why the physician is the chief in the four factors; his qualities;
28. His various branches of learning or his fourfold spiritual disposition in professional work:-all this, is dealt with in this minor chapter of “The Fourfold Basic Factors of Treatment”.
29. Thus, in the Section on General Principles, in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the ninth minor chapter entitled “The Fourfold Basic Factors of Treatment (Cikitsa—cikitsā)” is completed.
The Adequacy of the Basic Factors of health
3. “The physicians speak of therapeusis as being four pillared and sixteen-faceted; the same was spoken of in the previous chapter as having sixteen attributes. Now this therapeusis applied skilfully, is sufficient for the restoration of health”. Thus said the worshipful Punarvasu, the son of Atri.
Maitreya’s Proposition
4-(1). “No”, said Maitreya, “But why? Because there are seen some patients possessed of means, having attendants, self-controlled and treated by expert physicians, recovering, while some others, though enjoying similar amenities, dying nevertheless. Thus, treatment becomes a thing of no consequence.
4-(2). It is comparable to a few drops of water sprinkled in a pit or lake, or to a handful of dust scattered on a flowing river or on a dust-heap.
4-(3). Conversely, we see others, devoid of means, with no attendants, no self-control, and treated by unskilled physicians, regaining health; and yet others, similarly circumstanced, dying all the same.
4. Thus, recovery follows treatment, death too follows treatment. Similarly, recovery follows in the absence of treatment, and in the absence of treatment, death too follows. Hence it is to be concluded that treatment is in no way better than no treatment.”
Atreya’s Decision on the Subject
5-(1) “Maitreya! you think wrongly”, said Atreya; and “how? Because what has been stated by you that patients, though given the systematic treatment possessed of all the sixteen qualities, die, is not sound. Treatment does not become inconsequential in regard to diseases amenable to treatment.
The Basic Principle of Treatment
5-(2). And, again, as regards those who recover without the aid of any treatment, even in their case, there is a special reason for giving them the complete course of treatment.
5-(3). Just as a man, by lifting another who has fallen although the latter is able to rise by himself, gives him support in consequence of which he rises sooner and without difficulty, in like manner do patients, receiving the aid of a complete treatment, recover more easily and without difficulty.
5-(4). As regards those patients who die in spite of full treatment, not all of them could be expected to recover by the blessings of treatment. For, not all diseases are amenable to treatment and yet, of those diseases as are amenable to treatment, cure cannot be accomplished except by treatment. However, the whole pharmacopeia will fail in curing irremediable diseases; and no physician, however clever, is able to save a dying patient.
5. Hence, only those that act after investigation are considered wise. As a bowman who is a good marks-man and given to constant practice, taking up a bow and releasing an arrow, does not fail in hitting a big target that is not too far off and achieves his purpose, so does a physician of accomplishment and means, who starts treating a curable disease alter full investigation, without fail bestow health on the patient. Hence, it cannot be said that treatment is no better than non-treatment.
6. This much is evident to us all, viz., we treat a disease-ridden man with disease-removing measures and the depleted man with impletion. We nourish the emaciated and the feeble; we starve the corpulent and the fatty, and treat the man afflicted by heat with cooling measures, and with hot things him who is afflicted with cold. We replenish body-elements that have suffered decrease, and deplenish those that have undergone increase. By treating disorders properly with what are antagonistic to their causative factors, we restore the patient to the normal condition. In our hands, administered in this manner, the pharmacopeia shows itself to the best of its excellence.
Here are verses again—
7.The physician who knows the differential diagnosis between the curable and the incurable among diseases and begins treatment with full knowledge of the case and in time, obtains success in his effort with certainty.
Loss of Reputation By Taking Up incurable Cases
8. But, the physician who undertakes to treat incurable diseases will invariably suffer loss of income, will tarnish his learning and fame, and earn for himself disrepute and taboo in society.
Further Divisions of Diseases
9. The curable diseases are of two kinds: those that are easily cured and those that are cured with difficulty. The incurable diseases also fall into two categories: those that are palliable and those that are absolutely irremediable.
10. The curables are, again, classed into three fresh categories by reason of their requiring mild, moderate or strong treatment. The incurable ones, being inexorable, admit of no such classification.
Easily Curable Diseases
11-13. The characteristics of an easily curable disease are: the causes, premonitory symptoms and symptoms are mild; the morbific factor is homologatory neither to the affected body-element nor to the habitus of the patient, nor. to the traits of the prevailing season; the place of disease is not inaccessible to treatment; the course of disease is localised in one system, is recent, has no complication and is born of the predominant morbidity of only a single humor; the body is in a condition to withstand all treatment and the fourfold requisites of treatment are at hand. These are the circumstances in which a disease is easily curable.
Formidable Diseases
14-16. The formidable diseases are those wherein the causes, pre-monitory symptoms and symptom are of moderate strength; when any one of the triad viz., season, habitus and susceptibility of body-elements is homologatory to the morbific factor the ailments of a gravida and of the aged and of children; those that are not much aggravated by complication those requiring operative, caustic and cauterizing procedures; those that have gone beyond the incipient stage; those that are located in a part difficult of access; those whose course is localized in one system; those in which the full complement of the four-fold medical equipment is not available those which have spread through two body-systems but have not become very chronic; and those due to the predominant morbidity of only two humors.
Mitigable ones and incurable ones
17-20. The diseases of the following description are to be regarded as incurable but palliable: viz. those in which the patient, being still possessed of a part of life-span needs to be kept going by means of strict regimen; those which admit of slight relief, but which get readily aggravated from slight causes; those which are deep-seated; those which affect many body-elements; those which have lodged themselves in vital parts and joints; those which are constantly relapsing; those which are long standing and those which are born of the discordance of only two humors.
The following diseases are both incurable and immitigable; those which are similar to the above with the exception of those wherein the expectation of life is still left and the possibility of some relief; which are born of the discordance of all the three humors, which have gone beyond the stage of treatment, which have spread to all the systems of the body, which give rise to sudden and extreme excitement, restlessness and stupefaction, which destroy the sense-faculties, which, afflicting weakened constitutions, get greatly aggravated, and which are accompanied with the fatal prognostic signs.
The Advantages of the Differential Diagnosis
21. A wise physician should first examine the signs and symptoms of the disease and only then commence treatment of curable ones.
22. One who knows the differential diagnosis between curable and incurable diseases, as also the right mode of application, will not fall into such erroneous mode of thinking as Maitreya and others did.
Summary
Here are a couple of recapitulatory verses—
23-24. Here in this Major chapter on the “Fourfold Basic Factors of Therapeusis”, have been laid down treatment, its composition and character, the result proceeding from treatment, the difference of opinion between Atreya and Maitreya, the decision concerning this doctrinal difference, and the fourfold classification of curability and incurability of diseases, together with the characteristics of each class.
10. Thus, in the Section on General Principles, in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the tenth Major chapter entitled “The Fourfold Basic Factors in Therapeusis (Cikitsa—cikitsā) ” is completed.
The Pursuit of Life
4-(1). From among these pursuits (eshana), the pursuit of life is to be given priority. Why? Because, the giving up of life means the giving up of everything.
4-(2). The preservation of life is done thus; by the healthy by observing the rules of health and by the ailing, by being diligent in the alleviation of abnormal symptoms. These two aspects have been touched upon and will be dealt with hereafter.
4. By following what has here been laid down, a person husbanding his vital resources, attains long life. Thus, the first pursuit has been dealt with.
The Pursuit of Wealth
5-(1). Next, the pursuit of wealth should be taken up. For, after life, wealth is the end to be sought. Surely there is no wretchedness more wretched than that of the man possessed of long life but lacking the appurtenances that make life worth living. Therefore, effort should be made to acquire these appurtenances.
5-(2). We shall indicate the means of acquiring these necessaries of life. They are agriculture, rearing of cattle, trade and service of the king, etc. In addition to these, one may resort to such other occupations as, to one’s knowledge, are not disapproved of by the righteous and provide both livelihood and opulence.
5. Conducting himself in this manner, a man lives for long and with dignity. Thus the second one, the pursuit of wealth, has been dealt with.
The Pursuit of the after-Life
6-(1). Lastly, the third pursuit-that of the other world should be taken up. This is beset with doubt. How? Thus, namely, shall we continue to exist after we have slipped from this life or shall we not?
6. But wherefore this misgiving? We shall explain. There are some who, in their exclusive idolatry of direct observation, reject the rebirth of the spirit, because it is outside senseobservation. There are others who believe in the spirit’s rebirth solely on the authority of scripture. Tradition also differs on this matter. Thus, some hold that the mother and father are the actual authors of one’s birth; others that it is the law of nature; some others that it is divine handi-work and still others that it is mere accident. It is thus that doubt arises. Is there, of a truth, rebirth or is there not?
The Proof of the Existence of the Soul
7. On this question, the wise man should give up the negative attitude and even scepticism. Why? Because the visible is limited; while there exists invisibly a vast unlimited world of which we know by the evidence of scripture, inference and reason. As a matter of fact, even the very senses by whose agency direct observations are obtained are themselves outside the range of observation.
8.-(1) Further, even a perceivable object escapes observation under the following conditions—viz., when it is either too close or too remote from the observer, when it is obstructed by other objects, when there is some defect in the perceiving sense-organ, when the observer’s attention is elsewhere, when the object is merged in the mass, when it is over-shadowed by something else, or lastly, when it is microscopic.
8. Hence, it is an unfounded statement to make, that only the wimble exists and nothing else.
9-10. The various traditional beliefs, referred to earlier, are to be set aside as they conflict with reason. Thus, if the soul of either the father or the mother transmigrates into the offspring, it should do so in one of two ways, viz., either totally or in part. If the transmigration were total, then it should mean the immediate death of either the father or the mother. As regards partial transmigration, this alternative is overruled on account of the soul being an indivisible substance.
11. Since the intellect and the mind are as indivisible as the soul, the same objection as that set out in the case of the soul’s transmigration applies in their case also. Besides, according to the parental theory, there could be no possibility of the fourfold method of generation which is observed in Nature.
12. In reply to those who maintain that life is a natural phenomenon needing no extraneous causation, we say that, only that is natural which is innate, like the unique characteristics of the six elements. There can be no life unless these come together and in all operations of conjunction and disjunction, the sole factor is antecedent action which is not accounted for in the Nature theory.
13. The element of consciousness-the soul, which is beginningless, can not be the product of anything. If what is meant is that, the soul itself is the ultimate cause of everything else, then we have no quarrel with the theory of “Divine handiwork”.
14-15. In the creed of the nihilist, whose understanding is obscured by the theory of accident, there can be no investigation, no data to be investigated, no agent, no cause, no gods, no seers, no adepts, no action, no fruit of actions, and of course, no soul. Surely this nihilistic persuasion is the most sinful of all sins.
16. Hence, the wise man should give up this blind creed, and, by recourse to the lamp of the wisdom of the saints, strive to see all things in their true nature.
The Four-Fold Test
17. Everything falls into the one or the other of the two categories ‘true’ and ‘untrue’. The method of investigation is fourfold: authoritative testimony, direct observation, inference and reason.
The Nature of the Authoritative Persons
18-19. The authorities are the Men:who have freed themselves from passion and ingorance by means of spiritual endeavour and knowledge, whose understanding, embracing the past, present and future, is pure and at all times unclouded; it is these that are the authoritative, the learned, the enlightened; their word is unimpeachable and true. Why will such men, devoid as they are of passion and ignorance, give utterance to untruth?
Sense-perception
20. Preception or observation is defined as the cognition, definite and immediate, arising from the conjunction of the soul, senses, mind and sense-objects.
Inference
21-22. Inference is that, which having its basis in observation, enables one to conclude in three several ways and with reference to all the three parts of time. Thus we infer the unseen fire from the observed smoke as also the past act of mating from the present signs of pregnancy. In this manner, the wise infer the past from the present, the unborn fruit of the future from the seed, having observed the fact that fruit is like unto the seed.
Correlation (Yukti)
23-24. That is the correlative reason by which we form such judgements as the following:—From the conjoint operation of water, tillage seed-sowing and season the crop will spring up; from the coming together of the five proto-elements and the soul, the sixth element, the embryo will take its rise; from the combination of the churner, the churning poles and the churning act, the fire will burst forth; from the excellent four basic factors of treatment, when these are rightly linked together, the cure of the disease will proceed.
25. That faculty of the mind which assesses the contribution of the various factors at work in a given case and which takes into account the past, the present and the future is to be known as correlation. It is by the exercise of correlative reason that the three ends of man—virtue, wealth and happiness, are achieved.
26. These four methods, and there is none other left, constitute the means of proof by which all things, whether true or false, are examined. Judged by them, there is rebirth.
Rebirth Based on Authority of Scripture
27-(1). Now the dignity of authoritative testimony belongs, in the first place, to the Vedas. It has been enlarged to include all such other writings as are not against the trend of the Vedas and have been compiled by scientific investigators and are for the good of the men of good-will everywhere. These, too, constitute authoritative testimony.
27. From such authoritative testimony, we learn that charity, austerities, sacrifices, truthfulness, practice of non-violence and Brahmacharya are the the means of attaining well-being and final emancipation.
28. Further exemption from recurrent birth is not promised by the blameless sages, in the scriptural texts to any but those that have won release from spiritual failings etc.
29. Therefore, the believers in scriptural texts should consider rebirth as established truth in conformity to the teaching of the great sages of the earliest times all of whom were free from fear, desire, hate, greed, delusion and pride, devoted to spiritual knowledge, trustworthy, skilled in religious observances, unclouded of spirit and understanding, and possessed of divine insight.
Rebirth Based on Direct Evidence
30. Observation also bears this out. Children are often dissimilar to their parents. Though coming into life under identical circumstances, children differ from one another in complexion, voice, appearance, disposition, intelligence and fortune. Some are born in high and some in low families. Some are condemned to servitude and some enjoy lordship. Some lead happy and some miserable lives. There is also disparity in the life-span of people. One reaps the rewards of deeds not done in this life. We find the infant performing such acts as crying, sucking the mother’s breasts, crowing and registering fear untutored. Dissimilar birth-marks indicative of different fortunes are noticed in different people. Even when the effort is similar, the reward is often dissimilar. There is aptitude for some type of work and inaptitude for others. People sometimes recall their past births saying, “We come here after passing through such and such existence”. People who look alike evoke affection and aversion in an unlike manner.
Rebirth Based on inference
31. From all this we infer the existence of an individual’s action, inescapable and indestructible, done in a previous birth, to which is given the name of destiny and which follows him, and the fruit whereof he is now seen to enjoy. Similarly, we infer that the action done in this life will bear its fruit in the next. The seed is inferred from the fruit and likewise, the fruit from the seed.
Rebirth Based on Correlation
32. Reason, too, argues to the same effect. Thus, the birth of the embryo is from the coming together of the six elements. Action is the result of the conjunction of agent and instrument. The result springs from an act performed and not from an unperformed act. There is no seedling in the absence of the seed. The result is commensurate with the effort. One kind of fruit is not born from another kind of seed. Thus argues reason.
The Need for Righteous Conduct
33-(1). Since all the four methods of investigation bear out the existence of rebirth, it behoves one to be diligent in the performance of the scriptural observances, viz., in waiting upon the teacher, in study, in the observance of vows, in taking a wife, in begetting children, in the maintenance of one’s dependants, in hospitality to the guest, in charity, in noncoveting, in the performance of austerities, in refraining from envy, in blameless activity of the body, speech and mind, in introspection concerning one’s body, senses, mind, thoughts, understanding and the soul, and lastly, in the concentration of the mind.
33-(2). Whatever similar activities there are, which to one’s knowledge, are approved of by the righteous, ennobling and capable of providing one with the means of sustenance and opulence, such too, should be undertaken.
33. Thus striving, one attains good report in this world and, after death, heaven. In this manner, we have set forth the third pursuit relating to the other world.
The Seven Triads
34. Now in the body there are three sub-supports; three-fold is the strength, three are the causative factors of. diseases, three are the types of diseases and three the systems for the occurrence of disease. Further, three are the classes of physicians and three the categories of medicine.
The Triad of Sub-supports
35. First, as regards the three subsupports, they are:—food, sleep and continence. The body being sustained by the right use of these three subsupports grows in strength, complexion and size, and endures for the full pre-ordained span of life, provided that no indulgence in unwholesome things, such as pointed out in this treatise, is practised.
The Three Kinds of Strength
36. Regarding the three kinds of strength, they are natural, periodic and acquired. Inherited strength of body and mind is called natural. Periodic strength is that which is dependent on the variations in season and age. Acquired strength is, again, that which accrues from diet and exercise.
The Triad of Disease-Factors
37-(1). Regarding the three causative factors of diseases: they are overuse, disuse and misuse in relation to sense-objects, activity and seasons.
37-(2). Thus, with reference to sight, it is overuse to gaze inordinately at excessively luminous objects; it is disuse not to look at anything at all; while it is misuse to gaze at objects that are either too close or too remote, awe-striking, terrible, prodigious, hateful, frightful, monstrous, alarming etc.
37-(3). Similarly, with reference to hearing, it is over-use to listen inordinately to such sounds as loud thunder-claps, beating of kettle-drums, loud cries etc.; it is disuse not to listen to any sound at all, while it is misuse to listen to sounds that are harsh, joy-killing, afflicting, humiliating, terrifying etc.
37-(4). Similarly with reference to the sense of smell, it is overuse to smell inordinately keen, rank and deliquescent odors; it is misuse not to smell anything at all; while it is misuse to smell odors that are putrid, hateful, unclean, putrifying, poisonous, cadaverous etc.
37-(5). Similarly, with reference to the sense of taste, it is overuse to indulge the palate inordinately; it is disuse to abstain altogether from all tastes; as regards misuse, we shall describe it in the section on the rules dealing with diet, leaving aside the question of quantum.
37. Similarly, with reference to the sense of touch, it is overuse to expose oneself inordinately to extreme cold and heat, as also to indulge overmuch in baths, oil-massage, friction-massage etc; it is disuse to refrain from all tactile stimuli; while it is misuse to resort to baths etc., and to cold and hot applications without reference to their right sequence; it is also a misuse of the tactile sense to let the body suffer contact with uneven surfaces, trauma, unclean things and evil spirits.
The Correlated Unity of the Organisms
38-(1). From among the senses, the sense of touch pervades all the others and has the mind inherent in it; for, the field of the mind is coextensive with that of the tactile sense.
38. Accordingly, all sensory response, referable ultimately to the ubiquitous sense of touch, when it does not subserve the general ends of the organism, falls into the five-fold tripartite classification of non-homologatory combination of the senses with their sense-objects. For, whatever subserves the purpose of the organism as a whole, is homologatory combination of the senses and their objects.
The Three Kinds of Action
39-(1). Action comprises the activity of speech, mind and of the body. Now, excessive action of anyone of these is overuse with reference to it while their total lack of action is disuse.
39-(2). Misuse with reference to the body consists of forced suppression or forced excitation of natural urges; also awkward stumbling, falling or posturing of limbs, abusing the body, injuring the body, violent kneading of the limbs, and forced holding of the breath and other kinds of self-mortification.
39-(3). Misuse, with reference to speech, is indulgence in language that is insinuating, untrue, untimely, quarrelsome, unpleasant, incoherent, unhelpful, harsh etc.
39. Misuse with reference to the mind, consists of giving way to fear, grief, anger, greed, infatuation, self-conceit, envy, deluded thinking etc.
40. In brief, all activity of speech, mind and body, which, while not coming under the heads of overuse and disuse, is yet unwholesome, though it may not have been specifically mentioned here, should be known as misuse.
41.In this manner, the threefold activity that is, pertaining either to speech, mind or body falling under the three heads of overuse, disuse and misuse, should be regarded as ‘volitional transgression’.
The Three Periods of the Year
42-(1). The year consists of the three periods of Winter, Summer and the Rains, characterised respectively by cold, heat and wetness. This constitutes time.
42. Now if a season is marked with an exaggeration of its characteristics, it is spoken of as “seasonal excess”; if it is marked with a deficiency of its traits, ii is spoken of as “seasonal deficiency”; and if the season is marked with traits that are contrary to its true nature, then it is spoken of as “Seasonal abnormality”. Time is also spoken of as“Change”.
Conclusion With Reference to Disease-Factors
43. Thus these three i.e. non-homologatory contact of senses and their objects, volitional transgression and change, each sub-divided again into three, constitute the causes for disease. Right co-ordination, on the other hand, is the cause of well-being.
Good and Evil Relative to their Respective Causes
44. The well-being or ill-being of anything is never independent of right co-ordination in the one case and absent, excessive or wrong coordination in the other; for, well-being and ill-being depend on the presence of their respective causative factors.
The Three Types of Disease
45. Regarding the three types of disease, they are endogenous, exogenous and psychic. Among these the endogenous disease is that arising from the discordance of the bodily humors, and the exogenous from spirit-possession, poisonous winds, fire, injuries etc.; while the psychic disorders arise from the gain of undesired as well as desired things.
The Treatment of Psychic Diseases
46-(1). Now the intelligent man when he finds himself afflicted with even psychic diseases, should, with right understanding, examine over and over again as to what is wholesome and what is unwholesome. He should then endeavour to abstain from whatever is not conducive to virtue, wealth and pleasure, and devote himself to such action as is conducive to the use of these three objectives. For, outside these three objectives of life, there is nothing in the world which is capable of giving pleasure or pain to the mind.
46. Hence one should conduct oneself in the above manner. One should strive to court the association of those learned in the knowledge of good and evil and also do one’s best to acquire the knowledge about one’s own self, country, family, age, vitality and ability.
Here is a verse again—
47. Contemplation of the three objectives of life, service of those who are versed in the knowledge concerning these three objectives, and the knowledge of one’s own self etc. in all respects, constitute the remedy for psychic disorders.
The Three Body-Systems Subject to Disease
48-(1). Regarding the three systems subject to the occurrence of disease: they are—(1) The peripheral system, (2) the vital parts and the bone-joints and (3) the alimentary tract.
48-(2). Among these,the peripheral system consists of such body-elements as the blood etc., and the skin. This is the external system for the occurrence of disease.
48-(3). The vital parts are again the viscera contained in the abdomino-pelvic, thoracic and cranial cavities etc., while the bone-joints are the articulations of bones and the tendons, and sinews covering these parts. This represents the. medial system for the occurrence of disease.
48. As regards the central system which is referred to in medical parlance by such synonymous terms as the great channel, the central part of the body, the great cavity, and the seat of digestion and assimilation, this is the internal system for the occurrence of disease.
49-(1). Among these, tumors, pimples, boils, scrofula, warts, granuloma, moles, dermic lesions, freckles and similar lesions, as well as the external types of acute spreading affections, edema, gulma, piles, abscesses and similar diseases are instances of the diseases occurring in the peripheral system of the body.
49-(2). Hemiplegia, tonic and chronic convulsions, facial paralysis, wasting, consumption, pain in bone-joints, prolapse of rectum and similar conditions, as well as the disease of the viscera contained in the cranial, and thoracic abdomino-pelvic cavities are the diseases that occur in the medial system.
49. Fever, diarrhea, vomiting, intestinal torpor, acute intestinal irritations, cough, dyspnea, hiccup, constipation, abdominal affection, splenic disorders etc., as well as the internal types of acute spreading affections are instances of diseases that occur in the internal or central system of the body.
Three Kinds of Physicians
50. Regarding the three kinds of physicians: three kinds of medical practitioners are found in the world; firstly, the impostors in physician’s robes; secondly, the vain-glorious pretenders, and thirdly, those endowed with the true virtue of the healer.
51. Those, who by parading their medical paraphernalia, books, models, smattering of medical texts and knowing looks, acquire the title of physician, are the first kind, viz., the ignoramuses and impostors.
52. Those, who by laying claim to association with persons of established wealth, fame, knowledge and success, while they themselves have none of these things, arrogate to themselves the designation of physicians, are the vain-glorious pretenders.
53. Those, who are accomplished in application, theory, knowledge of allied sciences and success of treatment, are the true healers. In them is the glory of the physician fully manifest.
The Three therapies
54-(1). Regarding the three kinds of therapy: they are divine therapy, scientific therapy and mind-control.
54-(2). Amongst these, divine therapy consists of incantations, herbs, gems, propitiatory rites, oblations and offerings, sacrifice, vows, ceremonial penitence, fasting, auspicious rites, prostrations, pilgrimages and such other things.
54-(3). Scientific therapy consists of the line of dietetic regimen and medication.
54. Mind-control consists of restraining the mind from the desire for unwholesome objects.
55-(1). When the humors in the body have become morbid and provoked, three kinds of therapeutic measures are mainly recommended: namely, internal purification, external purification and operative treatment.
55-(2). Of them, that procedure wherein medicine taken internally cures the disorders born of dietetic faults, is internal purification.
55-(3). And that procedure, which cures the disorders of the body and consists of inunction, sudation, application, affusion, massage etc., applied to the external surface of the body, is external purification.
55. The procedures of excision, incision, puncturing, rupturing, erasion, eradication, plastic operation, suturing and sounding as well as the application of caustics and leeches constitute operative treatment.
The Wise and the Ignorant Among Men
Here are verses again—
56. On the appearance of disease, the intelligent man immediately obtains relief by recourse to external or internal medication or by means of operative measures.
57. But the ignorant man fails from stupidity or negligence to note the incipient state of a disease, just as a simpleton fails to recognize a potential enemy.
58. Disease, from atomic beginning, assumes enormous proportions. Having become firm-rooted, it undermines the strength and life of the witless man.
59. The stupid man fails to recognize the seriousness of a disease till he is tormented by it; only after he is fairly in the grip of suffering, does he make up the mind to get the disease under control.
60. Then calling his sons, wife and kinsmen, he cries, “Get a physician to treat me at any cost.”
61. But where is the physician who can help a patient, reduced to such a plight, grown weak, tormented by disease, emaciated with waning faculties, given to despair and all but dead.
62. Finding no saviour, the wretched man relinquishes his hold on life, like an iguana that is laid hold of by the tail and is relentlessly dragged out of its hiding by a stronger creature.
63. Therefore, before ever diseases, show themselves or while yet they, are in the incipient stage, one who cares for one’s happiness should endeavour to have them treated with proper medications.
Summary
Here are the two recapitulatory verses—
64-65. The pursuits of man together with the sub-supports, strength, cause of disease, diseases, disease-systems, physicians and therapeutic measures—all these eight categories, each tripartite, have been laid down in this chapter on the “Three Pursuits” by the sage Krishna Atreya, unattached to the categories wherein everything is established.
11. Thus, in the Section on General Principles, in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the eleventh chapter entitled “The Three Pursuits (Eshana—eṣaṇa) of Man” is completed.
The Discussion Among the Safes
3-(1). Desirous of knowing one another’s opinion concerning the salutary and unsalutary aspect of Vata, the great sages, having assembled together, discussed among them selves thus—
3. “Of what character is Vata? What is its provoking factor? What again are its allaying agents? How do the exciting or allaying factors, unable as they are to come into contact with Vata which is incorporeal and unstable, succeed either in exciting or allaying it? What again are the doings of Vata moving within bodies and outside bodies, both when excited and when quiescent, both within the body and when at large in the universe?”
4. Then spoke Kusha, the son of Sankritya, “The characteristics of Vata are six, viz., dryness, lightness, coldness, hardness, roughness and clearness.”
The Exciting Factors of Vata
5-(1). Hearing this statement, Bharadvaja, known as Kumarashira, said, “It is even as your honour has said; such, to be sure, are the characteristics of Vata.
5. It is by the repeated use of such like qualities, such like substances and actions of such like potencies that Vata becomes excited. For, verily, the increasing factor of the body-elements is the repeated use of homologatory things?
The Sedating Factors of Vata
6-(1). Hearing this observation Kankayana, the physician from Bahli-ka country, said, “It is even as your honour has observed. Such, indeed, are the exciting factors of Vata.
6. The opposite of these are the allaying agents of Vata. For, surely, the alleviative factors in relation to the body-elements are just the opposite of the exciting factors”.
The Working Process of These Factors
7-(1). Hearing this remark, Badisha Dhamargava said, “It is, indeed, as your honour has declared. Such, of a truth, are the exciting and allaying agents of Vata.
7-(2). As regards how these provocative and sedative agents, while unable to come into contact with Vata, which is incorporeal and unstable, succeed in provoking or allaying it, we shall now explain.
7-(3). The exciting agents of Vata, in human bodies are, of course, those that induce dryness,, lightness, coldness, hardness, and porousness.
7-(4). Vata, having effected lodgement in bodies of such, description and having gained strength, gets provoked.
7-(5). The sedative agents are, conversely, those that promote unctuousness, heaviness, heat, smoothness, softness, sliminess and compactness.
7. In bodies of such description in the body, the vata, wandering about without obtaining lodgement, drifts into tranquility.
The Functions of Normal Vata in the Body
8-(1). Having heard this pronouncement of Badisha, conforming to the truth and approved by the assembly of the sages, the royal sage Varyovida said, “It is all, as your honour has propounded, unexceptionable. Now, as regards the doings of vata moving within bodies and outside bodies, both when excited and when not excited, both when confined in the human body and when at large in the universe, we shall, so far as we are able, give a detailed exposition of them in the light of observation, inference and authoritative instruction, having made our obeisance to Vata. The vata is the upholder of both, structure and function of the body. It is the very self of the five forms of vata in the body viz. Prana, Udana, Samana, Vyana and Apana. It is the impeller of upward and downward movements, the controller and conductor of the mind; The inspiritor of all the senses, the conveyer of all the sense-stimuli, the marshaller of the body-elements, the synthesizing principle in the body, the impeller of speech, the cause of feeling and audition, the source of the auditory and tactile senses, the origin of all excitement and animation, the stimulator of the gastric fire, the desiccator of the morbid humors, the eliminator of excrement and deobstruent of the gross and subtle body channels, the modeller of the fetal form, the sustaming principle of life—all these, are the functions of the normal vata in the body.
The Actions of the Provoked Vata in the Body
8-(2). When, however, the vata becomes abnormal in the body, it afflicts the organism with diverse kinds of disorders, tending to impair its strength, complexion, well being and life; it depresses the mind, impairs all the senses, destroys the fetus in the uterus, produces deformity in it, or unduly prolongs the period of gestation, gives rise to fear, grief, stupefaction, depression of the spirits and delirium, and obstructs the vital fuhctions.
The Actions of the Normal Vata in Nature
8-(3). Of the vata, which is at large in the universe and is in its normal condition, the following are the works-upholding the earth, setting the fire ablaze, the governance of the procession and orbits of the sun, the moon, the constellations and planetary systems, formation of the clouds, the release of the atmospheric water, the propulsion of the streams, the production of flowers and fruits, the germination of seeds, the variation of seasons, the evolution into different elements, their differentiation in weight and shape, the fertilization of seeds, the growth of crops, and absorption and evaporation of moisture in plants and all processes of change that are normal.
The Actions of the Abnormal Vata in Nature
8-(4). Of the vata moving about in the universe in an enraged condition, the following are the works:—They are: the grinding down of the peaks of the mountains, the up-rooting of trees, the churning up of the oceans, the upsurging of the lakes, the reversing of the courses of the rivers, the quaking of the earth, the inflation of the rain-clouds, the releasing of snow, thunder, dust, sand, fish, frogs, snakes, alkaline substances, blood, stones and lightning; the un-settlement of the six seasons, the retardation of the crops, the visitation of the pestilences, the destruction of all things create, the releasing of the wrath of the clouds, sun, fire and winds, which marks the end of a world cycle of four ages.
In Praise of Vata
8. Vata is God, the author and everlasting one, the maker and unmaker of creatures, the dispenser of happiness and misery, the death, the ruler of the underworld, the controller, the lord of creatures, the undivided one, the universal artificer, the omniform, the omnipervading, the disposer of all processes, the subtlest of all things, the omnipresent, the immanent, the pervader of all the worlds; Vata alone is God.”
Marichi’s Question
9.After hearing this dissertation of Varyovida, Marici observed: “No doubt this is so; but what is the purpose of either retaining or acquiring such information in the coure of a medical discussion? For, it is in connection with the science of medicine that this discussion has arisen.”
Varyovida’s Explanation
10-(l). Said Varyovida: “if the physician is unable to predict the destructive Vata, exceedingly strong, exceedingly fierce and exceedingly swift-moving, how can he, withstanding all his vigilance, forestall its sudden outburst, with a view to safe-guarding the people from the the of destruction?
10. Besides, a truthful panegyric of Vata, in itself, tends towards freedom from disease, increase of strength and complexion, body-lustre, growth, attainment of knowledge and the blessing of maximum longevity.”
The Effects of the Pitta
11-(l). Marici said: “It is Fire alone that located in the pitta gives rise to good and evil consequences according as it is in a normal or an abnormal condition.
11. These consequences are digestion and indigestion; vision and loss of vision; the normality and abnormality of temperature; the healthy and the diseased look; intrepidity and fear, anger and delight, confusion and lucidity, and such other pairs of opposite qualities.”
The Effects of the Kapha
12-(1). Hearing this statement of Marici, Kapya said, “It is Soma, the water-element alone, located in the Kapha of the body, that gives rise to good and evil consequences, according as it is in a normal or in an abnormal condition.
12. These are: compactness and flabbiness, plumpness and emaciation, zest and lassitude, virility and impotence, knowledge and ignorance, understanding and stupefaction, and such other pairs of opposite qualities”.
Atreya’s Conclusion
13-(1). Hearing this statement of Kapya, the worshipful Punarvasu, the son of Atri, said: “All of you have spoken rightly except as to your making exclusive claims.
13-(2). To be correct, it is all the three-vat a, pitta and kapha, in their normal co dition that combine to make a man whole of his senses, possessed of strength, good complexion and ease, and assured of great longevity, even as the triad of Dharma, Artha and Kama, when properly cherished, secure for him the highest good both here and in the other world.
l3. The same three, if rendered morbid, bring upon the man great tribulation, just as the three seasons grown abnormal afflict the world with evil at the time of destruction.”
14. All the sages approved and applauded the words of the worshipful Atreya.
Here is a verse again—
15. Hearing the award of Atreya all the sages received and applauded it, just as the gods receive and applaud the words of Indra.
Summary
Here are the two recapitulatory verses:—
16. The six characteristics, the two kinds of affecting factors, the multifarious activity and the four distinct functional variations of vata, and the individual actions of kapha and pitta.
17. The opinion of the great sages and that of Punarvasu concerning these matters—all this, has been set forth in this chapter on “The salutary and the unsalutary influences of Vata”.
12. Thus, in the Section on General Principles, in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the twelfth chapter entitled “The Salutary and Unsalutary influences of Vata” is completed.
3. Thus, the tetrad of special chapters is completed.
Agnivesha’s Queries Regarding Oleation (sneha)
3. Unto Punarvasu, seated in the company of the masters of the numerical metaphysics, known as the Sankhya, who had counted all the existing categories of truth, Agnivesha made the following inquiry having in his view the world’s welfare.
4. What are the sources of unctuous substances? How many groups of unctuous substances are there? What are the properties of each group of unctuous substance? What is the season and what are the corrigents of each of them? How many and what are their preparations?
5. How many kinds are there of dosage and how are they measured? Which lose is recommenced in which case? Which group of unctuous substance is beneficial to whom? What is the maximum period of administration?
6. Who are fit subjects for oleation (sneha) and who are not? What are the signs of successful oleation, under-oleation and over-oleation? What is wholesome and what is unwholesome before, after and on full digestion of the potion of unctuous substance?
7. Who are soft-bowelled and who are hard-bowelled? What are the complications likely to arise and what are their remedies? What is the regimen to be observed in simple and in purificatory oleation?
8. Who should be given the preparations of unctuous substances? What is the method? O, Master, possessed of immeasurable knowledge! I desire to know the entire science of oleation (sneha).
The Two Sources of Unctuous Substances
9. Then Punarvasu, the dispeller of doubts, replied, “O, gentle one! the sources of unctuous substances are two: vegetable and animal.
10. Til, buchanan’s mango, Abhishuka, beleric mvrobalan, red physic nut, chebulic myrobalan, castor seeds, mahwa, rape seeds, safflower, bael, peach, garden radish, linseed, pistachio, wal-nut, Indian beech and drumstick.
The Animal Sources
11. All these oil-yielding substances belong to the vegetable group while the animal sources of unctuous substances are fish, beasts and birds. Their milk and cures, ghee, flesh, fat and marrow are prescribed in oleation procedure (sneha).
The Virtues of Til Oil
12. Of all the kinds of vegetable oils, the til oil is considered the best for imparting strength and for oleation purposes; the castor oil is the best of purgatives.
The Virtues of the Castor Oil
13.-(1) The castor oil is pungent; hot, heavy and curative of vata and kapha. In combination with astringent, sweet and bitter substances, it also, cures pitta.
The Superior Excellence of Ghee
13. Ghee, oil, fat and marrow are considered the best amongst all the unctuous substances; amongst these again, owing to its peculiar adaptability in pharmaceutic preparations, ghee is the best.
The Virtues of Ghee
14. Ghee is curative of pitta and vata, is beneficial to the nutrient bodyfluid, semen and vital essence; it is refrigerant and emollient, and clarifies the voice and complexion.
The Qualities of Oil
15. Vegetable oil is curative of vata, does not increase kapha, improves strength, is a dermic tonic, hot, stabilizing and a vaginal depurative.
The Qualities of Animal Fat
16. Animal fat is indicated in wounds, fractures, trauma, prolapse of uterus, ear-ache and head-ache; it is Used for increasing virility, as also in oleation procedures (sneha) and after exercise.
The Qualities of Marrow
17. Marrow increases strength, semen, nutrient body-fluid, kapha, fat and marrow. It is especially good for increasing the strength of the bones and in oleation procedure (sneha).
The Proper Seasons for Using Ghee
18. Ghee should be quaffed in the autumn, fat and marrow in the spring and oil in the first rains. A man should not take oleation during the very hot and the very cold seasons
Indications and Contra-indications with Reference to Oleation
19. A man who has excess of vata and pitta may take the oleation (sneha) dose at night even in very hot weather, and a man who has excess of kapha, may take it by day even during the cold season, when the sun is clear and bright.
The Evils of the Violation of Rules
20. But if the oleation (sneha) is taken in the day, either in the excessively hot season or by a person suffering from excess of vata and pitta, it causes fainting, thirst, insanity or jaundice.
21. And if oleation (sneha) is taken at night, either in the excessively cold season or by one suffering from excess of kapha, it causes obstipation, anorexia, colic or anemia.
The after-Potions in Oleation  (sneha)
22. Warm water should be drunk after the potion of ghee; soup is recommended after oil; rice-water after fat and marrow; and warm water after all kinds of oleation doses.
The Twenty-four Oleous Preparations
23. Cooked rice, thick gruel, meat-juice, flesh, milk, curds, gruel, pulse-soup, vegetables, simple soup, curd-soup, curry-soup;
24. roasted grain flour, til-paste, wine, linctus, confections, inunction, enemata and vaginal douches;
25. gargles, ear-fill and nasal, aural and ocular medications—these twenty-four are the preparations used in oleation procedure (sneha).
26. An unctuous substance taken purely by itself is not called a ‘preparation’. It is the basis of all the preparations made of unctuous substances.
27-28. By a process of permutation and combination of the six categories of taste, oleation preparations are of sixty-three varieties while the pure draught of the unctuous substance added to it makes one more. Thus they make sixty-four preparations of oleation in all. They should be prescribed by the physician who is expert in recognising habitus, season, disease and vitality of the patient.
The Three Dosages in Oleation (sneha)
29. The maximum, moderate and minimum doses of oleation (Snehamatra—snehamātrā) are the quantities which take for their digestion twenty-four hours, twelve hours and six hours respectively.
30. Thus have been described the three kinds of doses according to the time they take in digestion. Now I shall explain to you the method of using them in various types of individuals.
Indication for the Maximum Dose
31-32. Persons who are habituated to heavy oleation or hardened to hunger and thirst, who have very strong digestive power, who are very vigorous and who are suffering from gulma, snake-bite, actue spreading affections, insanity, dysuria and scybalous stools, should take the maximum dose of oleation  (sneha) .
The Virtues of the Maximum Dose
33-34. Now, listen to the benefits of the maximum dose. This dose, if properly administered, soon quells the above-mentioned disorders. This maximum dose is able to pervade every part of the body and draw out all the morbid matter. It is invigorating and revitalizing to the body, senses and mind.
Indication for the Moderate Dose
35-36. Persons afflicted with boils, vescicles, pimples, pruritus, papules and similar eruptions, as also persons suffering from dermatosis, anomalies of urinary secretion, rheumatic conditions, and those who are not heavy eaters, who are soft-bowelled, and those possessing average vitality, should take the moderate dose.
The Virtues of the Moderate Dose
37. This dose is not attended with severe complications. It does not reduce the strength very much, conduces to oleation  (sneha) with ease and is prescribed for purification.
Indication for the Minimum Dose
38-39. Those who are old, young, and delicate, given to easeful life, to whom the emptiness of bowels is unwholesome, whose digestive fire is low, who suffer from chronic fever, diarrhea or cough and are of low vitality, should take the minimum dose.
The Virtues of the Minimum Dose
40. This dose needs little aftercare, conduces to oleation, is roborant, virilific, invigorating and harmless and can be used for a long time.
Indication for the Potion of Ghee
41-43. Those who are of vata and pitta habitus or suffering from vata and pitta disorders, those who are keen on preserving their eye-sight, those who are injured, wasted, old, young or weak, who are desirous of longevity, improvement in strength, complexion, voice, plumpness, progeny, and youthfulness and increase of brightness, lustre, memory, talent vital, heat, understanding and power of the senses, those afflicted with heat and those that are injured by weapons, poison and fire should resort to potion of ghee.
Indication for Potion of Oil
44. Those who have kapha and fat in excess, who have pendulous and fatty neck and belly, who are overcome by vata disorders; who are of vata habitus,
45-46. who desire strength, lean; ness, lightness, firmness, stability of limbs and elastic, smooth and thin skin, who are infected with intestinal worms, who are hard-bowelled and, suffer from sinuses or fistulas and are accustomed to oils, should quaff oil in the cold season.
Indication for the Potion of Fat
47-49. Those who are inured to severe wind and sun and who are dry, emaciated by load-carrying and way-faring, whose semen, blood, kapha and fat have decreased, who have severe pain in the bones, joints, vessels, muscles, vital parts, and alimentary tract, and in whom the highly provoked vata, becoming localized, has obstructed the various orifices of the body, those whose digestive power is very great and to whom animal-fat is hpmologatory—in all these cases, where oleation  (sneha) is indicated, animal fat is prescribed.
Indication for Potion of Marrow
50-50½. Those whose digestive fire is very active, who are inured to hardships, who are gluttonous, and habitual takers of oleation  (sneha) , afflicted with vata, hard-bowelled and who need oleation, should use marrow for oleation. Thus has been described each group of oleation, as also which group is useful to which sort of patient.
The Two Courses of Oleation  (sneha)
51. There are two courses of oleation: one of seven days and the other of three days.
Persons to whom Oleation is Indicated
52. Oleation (sneha) is indicated in those who are to undergo sudation or purification procedures those who are dehydrated, suffering from vata disordors; those who are addicted to exercise, wine and women, and those who are given to mental exertion.
Persons in whom it is Contra-indicated
53. Oleation (sneha) is contra-indicated in those who have been advised, dehydration therapy without the purificatory procedure, and in those in whom kapha and fat have increased.
54. To those who have profuse mucus-discharge from the mouth or rectum, who have constantly low digestive fire, who are overcome by thirst, and fainting to a gravida, to those who have parched palate,
55-56. to those who have repulsion for food, vomit, to those who are afflicted with the diseases of the stomach, chyme disorders and chronic poisonings, to those who are weak and excessively attenuated, to those who have disgust for oleation who are suffering from chronic alcoholism and to those who are undergoing the procedure of nasal medication or enema, oleation (sneha) should not be given, for otherwise, the patient is liable to contract dreadful diseases.
Signs of Under-Oleation
57. Stools remaining scybalous and dry, the Vata not becoming regulated, the digestive power remaining weak, and roughness and dryness of limbs persisting—all these, are the signs of under-oleation.
Signs of Successful Oleation
58. The Vata becoming regulated, the gastric fire becoming activated, the stools being unctuous and loose, and the body becoming soft and smooth—these are the signs of successful oleation.
Signs of Over-Oleation
59. Pallor, heaviness, dullness, undigested condition of stools, torpor, anorexia and retching are the signs of over-oleation.
Preparation for Oleation (sneha)
60. A person desirous of taking oleation (sneha) the next morning, should take, in due measure, diet which is liquid, hot, not provocative of Kapha, not very unctuous and not promiscuous.
The Proper Time for the Purificatory and the Sedative Potions
61. The sedative dose of oleation (sneha) may be taken at the usual time of meals if a person is hungry; while the purificatory dose should be taken after the night-meal has been completely digested.
Indications and Contra-indications in an Oleated Person
62-64. He should use only warm water, observe celibacy, sleep only at night, refrain from suppressing the urges of feces, urine, flatus and eructation, avoid physical exercise, loud speaking, anger, grief, severe cold and sunshine, and should sleep and sit in a place free from draughts. Such is the regimen to be observed after and during the oleation course. Severe disorders ensue from wrongful regimen during oleation procedures (sneha).
The Nature of the Soft-Bowelled and the Hard-Bowelled Conditions
65. A soft-bowelled person gets oleated in three days by using pure oleation substances while a hard-bowelled person takes seven days to get oleated.
66-67. Gur, sugar-cane juice, curds, water, milk, churned curds, pudding, kedgeree, ghee, juices of white teak and the three myrobalans, grape-juice, juice of toothbrush tree, warm water and fresh wine—a soft-bowelled person is purged by a draught of any one of these.
68. These will however fail to purge the hard-bowelled person. The assimilative organs of a hard-bowelled person are affected by excess of Vata.
69. The assimilative organs of a soft-bowelled person are affected by excess of Pitta, meagreness of Kapha and mildness of Vata; hence such a man is said to be easilu purgeable.
Treatment of the Complication of Dipsosis
70. The oleation draught, quaffed by him whose assimilative region has an excess of Pitta and whose digestive fire is very powerful, is soon consumed to nothing by the heat of the digestive fire.
71. The strong gastric fire fuelled by oleation (sneha), having consumed the quantum of oleation and attenuating the vitality, creates acute thirst with many other complications.
72. Even a very heavy meal is not able to quench the digestive fire grown inordinate with oleation draughts. If this person does not get his thirst quenched with very cooling water, he gets very much heated, just as a serpent gets afflicted by the heat of its own venom when it is caught up in a closed hole.
73. A physician should give the patient emesis if the complication of thirst has arisen while the oleation draught is not digested. The patient may then drink cold water and take dry food; and he may be given emesis once again.
The Complications of Wrongful Oleation
74. Simple ghee should not be taken in conditions of Pitta and especially when it is associated with chymedisorder. It will give icteric tinge to the entire body (jaundice), and destroying consciousness, may even kill the patient.
75-76. Torpor, nausea, constipation, fever, stiffness, unconsciousness, dermatosis, pruritus, pallor, edema, piles, anorexia, thirst, stomach disorders and assimilation-disorders, rigidity, suppression of speech, colic and chyme-disorders are produced as the result of wrongful oleation procedure (sneha).
The Treatment thereof
77-78. In these cases, emesis, sudation and expectant treatment and laxatives are to be administered, after ascertaining the degree of severity of each complication. A course of butter-milk, wine, use of dry eats and drinks, various urines and the three myrobalans are the remedies for the complications arising from the wrongful procedure of oleation.
The Causes of the Complications
79. The oleation (sneha) taken at the wrong time, in contra-indicated conditions, in wrong dose, with wrong regimen or for too long a time, gives rise to complications
80. After taking the oleation dose and resting for three nights, and subsisting during these three days upon unctuous, liquid and hot meat-juice together with rice, the patient should take the purgative dose.
The Regimen in Sedative Oleation
81.-(1). The emetic dose may be taken after resting for one day in this manner.
81. The regimen in oleation (sneha) which is not to be followed by purificatory procedure, is the same as that laid down for the purificatory procedure.
82. Oleation (sneha) in the form of preparation should be given to those persons who have a disgust for oleation, who are addicted to unctuous articles, who are soft-bo welled, not inured to hardship and who are habitual drinkers.
83. Meat-juices of common quail, partridge, peacock, swan, boar, cock, ox,goat,wild sheep and fish are wholesome for administering in the oleation procedure (sneha) .
84. Barley, small jujube, horsegram, unctuous substances, gur,crystal sugar, pomegranate, curds and the three spices are the group of articles to be used with meat-juices.
85. Til, taken before meal together with unctuous articles and treacle will serve as oleation (sneha) ; and similarly will sumptuously unctuated kedgeree and curd-soup act, mixed with plenty of til.
86. The dehydrated man should take treacle, ginger and oil together with Sura wine; and, on this being digested, he should take a meal along with spit-roasted flesh.
87. The man of Vata-habitus gets oleated by taking oil together with the skim of Sura wine or animal fat or marrow, or milk mixed with treacle.
88. A man is oleated by taking udder warm milk mixed with unctuous articles and crystal sugar, or by taking cream of curds with treacle.
89. The thin gruel of Pancaprasriti and milk-pudding, containing black gram and generously mixed with unctuous articles, will quickly oleate a man.
90. The thin gruel of Pancaprasriti articles prepared with eight tolas each of ghee, oil, fat, marrow and rice should be taken by a person desiring oleation (sneha) .
91.-(1). The pork-juice mixed with unctuous substances and combined with ghee and salt, taken twice a day diligently oleates a man soon.
Contra-indications with Reference to Oleation (sneha)
91. Persons suffering from dermatosis, edema and anomalies of urinary secretion should not use for oleation (sneha), the flesh of domestic, wet-land and aquatic animals, gur, curds, milk and til.
92. They should be oleated as indicated, with oleation preparation made of articles preventive of all complications, as for instance, preparations made with long pepper, chebulic myrobalan or the three myrobalans.
93. The physician should prepare the oleation (sneha) with the decoction of grapes and emblic myrobalan mixed with sour curds and the pulp of the three spices; by taking this potion, a man gets oleated.
94. Ghee extracted direct from milk and prepared with the soup of barley, indian jujube and horse-gram, alkali, Sura wine and curds is the best of all ghees to be used in oleation (sneha).
95. Oil, marrow, animal fat and ghee prepared with the decoction of jujube and the three myrobalans should be prescribed in gynecic and seminal disorders.
96. Just as water saturates the cloth to its capacity and then drains off, so does the unctuous dose get digested according to the strength of the gastric fire and drain off when in excess.
97. Or, just as the water hurriedly poured over the lump of clay flows away without saturating it, so also does the hurriedly taken unctuous potion pass out without fully oleating the body.
The Virtues of Adding Salt
98. The unctuous substance mixed with salt hastens the process of oleation (sneha) , as salt has liquefacient, non-dry, subtle, hot and diffusive properties.
99. Oleation (sneha) should be done first; then sudation should be given, and when oleation (sneha) and sudation have been accomplished, the purificatory procedure or the sedative procedure should be given.
Summary
100. Here is a recapitulatory verse—
Unctuous articles, the full procedure of oleation (sneha), the likely complications and their remedies together with drugs required—all these, have been described by the worshipful son of Candrabhaga, in accordance with the questions asked.
13. Thus, in the Section on General Principles, in the treatise complied by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the thirteenth chapter entitled “The Oleation Procedure (sneha)” is completed.
The Virtues of Sudation Procedure (sveda)
3. Now we shall describe the various sudation procedures (sveda) which, if properly administered, alleviate such diseases of Vata and Kapha as are amenable to the sudation therapy.
4. If the morbid Vata in a man is corrected by oleation procedure preceded by oleation, his urine, semen and feces do not get inspissated.
5. Even dry inanimate sticks, treated with oiling and sweating, become soft and elastic. The same principle applies with" even greater force to animate human bodies.
The Effective Method of Sudation (sveda)
6. That sudation (sveda) is considered efficacious, which is well contrived, well-medicated and which is neither too hot nor too mild, and applied to the proper region with due consideration to the disease, season and vitality of the patient.
The Dosage Dependent on State of Morbidity etc.
7. Where the vitality of the patient and the condition of morbidity are very great and the season is very old, the maximum dose of sudation should be administered. Where these conditions are low, the dose should be minimum; where they are moderate, the dose should be moderate.
8. Sudation (sveda) is indicated in disorders of Vata-cum-Kapha or of Vata or Kapha. It should be prescribed unctuous-cum-dry, unctuous and dry respectively in the above conditions.
9. When Vata is localized in the stomach and Kapha is accumulated in the colon, the procedure of sudation in the first case should begin with the dry type and in the second with the unctuous type.
10. The testes, heart and eyes should be sweated mildly or not at all. The groins should be sweated moderately and the rest of the bodyparts as required.
The Protective Methods of the Cardiac Region Etc.
11. A person while being sweated should have his eyes shielded with a clear piece of doth or wheat-dough or with the leaves of the lotus plant or of bengal kino.
12. Cool strings of pearls, cool vessels, wet lotuses or wet hands should be applied to the cardiac region of the person who is being sweated.
The Signs of Successful Sudation (sveda)
13. The cessation of the sudation procedure is advised when the cold and the colicky pain have ceased, stiffness and heaviness of body have disappeared and softness and perspiration have set in.
The Signs of Over-Sudation
14. The symptoms of over-sudation are provocation of pitta, fainting, prostration of body, thirst, burning, weakness of voice and limbs-
The Treatment of the Evils of Over-Sudation
15. All the treatment advised in disorders due to excessive heat of summer, in the chapter on “Seasonal Dietary”, is to be given in condition of over-sudation, viz., the sweet, the unctuous and the cooling medications.
Persons in whom Sudation (sveda) is Contra-indicated
16-19. The physician should not administer sudation to addicts to astringent wines, to the gravida, to persons suffering from hemothermia, to persons of pitta-habitus suffering- from diarrhea, to those whose body fluid has been diminished, to those who suffer from glycosuria, to persons with sloughing or prolapsed rectum, to persons suffering from toxicosis or alcoholism, persons who are fatigued or unconscious or are obese, or who suffer from urinary anomalies due to Pitta, or from thirst, hunger, anger, grief and jaundice, and to those who suffer from abdominal diseases, helcosis, rheumatic troubles, debility, excessive dehydration, diminution of vitality or faintness.
Diseases Amenable to Sudation Therapy (sveda)
20-24. Sudation (sveda) is considered beneficial in coryza, cough, hiccup, dyspnea, heaviness of body, aching pain in the ear, neck and head, cacophonia, throatspasm, facial paralysis, paralysis of one limb or the entire body or hemiplegia or in flexures of the body, in distension of the abdomen, constipation and suppression of urine, pendiculation, stiffness of the sides, body, back, waist and abdomen; in sciatica dysuria enlargement of scrotum body-aches, pain and stiffness of feet knee, thigh and calves in edema, in neuralgia of upper and lower extremities, in disorders of chyme, in chills, tremors, ortho-arthritis, in contractions or extensions, colicky pain, in stiffness, heaviness, numbness and in diseases affecting the whole body.
Articles used in Lump and Hot Bed Sudations
25-27. The lumps for sudation (sveda) should be made of til black gram, horse-gram, acid substances, ghee, oil, meat and cooked rice, milk-pudding, kedgeree or flesh; or they may also be made of the excrements of cow, ass, camel, hog and horse, or of unhusked barley, sand, earth, stone, dry dung and iron powder. The first group is used for persons of the Vata habitus, while the second for those of Kapha habitus. The same articles are recommended to be used as required in hot-bed sudation too.
Articles Used in Cellar and Hot House Sudation
28. In the sudation-cellar, in the hothouse sudatorium, in warm enclosed central rooms, the person who is well anointed will sweat easily by the smokeless heat of live-coals.
29-30. The flesh of domestic, wetland and aquatic animals, milk, the head of a goat, the trunk, bile and blood of a hog, unctuous articles, til and rice—these should the wise physician, who is conversant with the nature of clime and season, make use of, in the right manner after they are well decocted, in kettle sudation.
31-32. By decocting in water, three leaved caper, guducb, castor oil plant, drumstick, garden radish, rape-seeds, leaves of vasaka, bamboo, indian beech, leaves of mudar, heart-leaved fig seeds of drumstick, common yellow nail dye, arabian jasmine, holy basil, and shrubby basil, the kettle sudation should be carried out.
33. Bishop’s weed, penta-radices, whey, urines, sour drugs and unctuous articles should be used in kettle sudation.
Articles Used in the Immersion and Affusion Sudation
34. These very decoctions i. e. the three mentioned above, may be used in preparing the tub-bath sudation. Ghee, milk or oil may also be used in the tub intended for bath-sudation.
Anticles Used in Poultice Sudation
35. Broken wheat, barley flour mixed with sour drugs, oleous articles, yeast and salt are recommended in poultice sudation.
36. Fragrant articles, Sura-yeast, cork swallow wort, dill seeds, linseed, and costus, combined with oil, should be used in poultice sudation.
The Bandages used in Poultice Sudation
37. The poultice should be covered with a hide, containing hair and free from bad smell and of a hot potency. If such is not available, silk or woollen cloth may be used instead.
The Procedures of the Application and Removal of the Poultices
38. If poultice is applied in the night it should be removed the next day, and if applied in the day, it should be removed the same night for preventing the irritation of the skin. The period of application of the poultice may be prolonged in the cold season.
The Thirteen Modes of Sudation Procedure (sveda)
39 40. Mixed fomentation, hotbed sudation, steam-kettle sudation, affusion-sudation, bath-sudation, Jentaka or hot house sudation, stone bed sudation, trench sudation, cabin sudation, ground-bed sudation, pitcher-bed sudation, pit-sudation and under-bed sudation—these are the thirteen varieties of sudation procedure. I shall describe all of them in detail in due order.
The Preparation of the Mixed Sudation
41. That should be known as the mixed (dry-cum-unctuous) local sudation which is carried out with the lumps prepared of articles mentioned above, either wrapped in a cloth or unwrapped.
The Preparation of the Hot-Bed Sudation
42. The bed should be spread either with corn, pulse and Pulaka grain or Veshavara pudding, milk-pudding, kedgeree and pancake and covered with either a silk or woollen cloth or leaves of castor-oil plant or red castor-plant and mudar. Sudation carried out on the person well inuncted over the whole of his. body and made to lie on such a bed, is called the hot-bed sudation.
The Preparation of the Steam-Kettle Sudation
43. Take the articles indicated in sudation viz., the root, fruit, leaves, buds etc., of the vegetable group or the carved flesh and the head of birds and beasts of hot potency or of the animal group, and mixing them with sour, salt and unctuous articles as are necessary or with urine, milk and similar other articles, decoct them in a pot closing the lid tightly so as not to allow the steam to escape. Make a tube of the shape of the elephant’s trunk with the leaves of either bamboo or leaves of indian beech or mudar. Its length should be one Vyama (6 feet) or half a Vyama (3 feet). Its circumference at the proximal end should be a fourth part of Vyama, while at the distal end an eighth part of Vyama; and throughout the entire length, it should be covered with leaves possessed of Vata-curing properties The tube should have two or three bends. The patient, having anointed himself with the unction prepared of Vata curing articles should inhale the steam from this apparatus. The steam, passing through the bends in a tortuous course, is deprived of its violence and without irritating the skin, it sweats the patient with ease. This inhalation is called the steam kettle sudation.
The Preparation of the Affosion Sudation
44. The above-mentioned drugs, which are curative of Vata and which are beneficial in conditions where Vata is predominant, decocted to a degree of genial warmth, should be filled in and affused from a pot or a shower or a douche-can over a person anointed with properly medicated unctuous substances ar:d covered with a cloth. This is called the affusion sudation.
The Preparation of the Immersion Sudation
45.Immersion in the decoction of substances curative of Vata, milk, oil, ghee, meat-juice and warm water is called the immersion or tub-bath sudation.
The Preparation of the Hot-House Sudation
46-(1). If one desires to administer the hot-house sudation, the place should be well selected, either on the eastern or the northern side. A pleasant and fertile piece of laud with black. sweet earth or golden colored soil should be selected. It must be on the bank of a pool, tank or reservoir of water having near to it a flight of steps on the southern or western side. A round chamber should be built on an even and well laid out plot with the frontage on its eastern or northern side, facing the water and about seven or eight cubits distant. Its height should be sixteen cubits at the most and the diameter also the same. It should be circular in shape. The walls and roof should be of earth and should be well plastered, leaving a number of air-holes.
46-(2). Within this chamber, there must be built all around, excepting at the entrance, a platform one cubit in height and in breadth. In this chamber, must be constructed with earth, an oven of four spans’ breadth and of a man’s height, with a multiple of small holes and a lid on its top. It should then be filled with the sticks of catechu, sal and other similar kinds of wood, and ignited.
46-(3). When it is known that the wood is fully burnt away, and the smoke is gone and the hot house has been heated to the degree of right temperature required for the sudation (sveda), then, the person, anointed with Vata-curative substances and covered with a cloth, should be made to enter it.
46-(4) While he enters, he should be told, “Gentle one, enter for gaining well-being and health. Having entered and getting on to the platform, lie down either on your right or the left side as is comfortable to you. Though overcome by sweating and fainting, you must not leave the platform. You must cling to it as long as life’s breath is in you. If once you let go your hold of the platform, being overpowered by perspiration and faintness you will be unable to find the doorway and immediately lose your life. So you should, on no account, leave the platform.
46-(5). When you feel yourself cleansed of inspissated impurities, well drained of viscid perspiration, well and copiously sweated, and your bodychannels have been well dilated and you have been rendered light, and you have known that all obstruction, stiffness, numbness, pain and heaviness have left you, then, should you, following the platform, reach the entrance.
46. Having emerged, do not rush straight to touch cold water, as it will harm your eyes. When you have got over the heat and fatigue, after the lapse of a muhurta (¾ hour), you must have suitable affusion in genially warm water and then, you may take your meal.” This is the procedure to be followed in the hot house-sudation.
The Preparation of the Stone Slab Station
47-48. Heat well a thick stone slab which is of the size of a bed with the fire of wood that is curative of Vata. Then, removing all the coals and cleaning the stone-slab with hot water, cover it with a silk or woollen cloth.
49. Then, the person should be inuncted over his entire body and covered with cotton cloth, deer-skin, silk-cloth or blanket and other kind of covering and should be made to lie on it. Thus, he will sweat happily. This is called the stone-bed sudation.
The Preparation of the Trench Sudation
50-51. The trench sudation will now be described. The man, who is well versed in the classification of land, should get a trench dug under the bedstead and fill it with smokeless live coal. The person lying over this bedstead gets well sweated. This is called the Trench Sudation.
The Preparation of the Cell Sudation
52. Prepare a thick-walled hut which is not of very great dimensions, which is round in shape and without any holes or windows, and smear its inner walls with costus and Mother fragrant articles.
53. In the middle of this hut, the physician should prepare a bed covered with cotton or silk sheet, deer skin or woollen rug and sack-cloth.
The Preparation of the Ground-Bed Sudation
54. Then, stoves full of live and smokeless charcoal, should be placed all around the bed and the patient well inuncted, should be subjected to sudation (sveda).
55. The ground-bed sudation also should be done in the manner prescribed for the stone-bed sudation. The site, it is advised, should be clean, even and free from draught.
The Preparation of the Pitcher Sudation
56-56½. Bury, to one third or half part, a pitcher filled with decoction curative of Vata, in the earth. A seat or bed not very thickly covered is to be placed over it.
57-58. Then, red hot balls of iron or stones must be put into the pot and by the heat emanating therefrom, the person, who is well anointed with unctuous substances curative of Vata and well covered, sweats comfortably lying on this bed.
59. A pit, of the size of the bed and double thereof in depth, should be made in a windless and pleasant place and the inside of it well cleansed.
60. The dry dungs of the elephant, horse, cow, ass and camel are to be burnt in it; and the patient, well anointed and well covered, if subjected to this method of sudation (sveda), sweats comfortably.
The Preparation of the Holaka Sudation
61-61½. Set fire to a heap of the dungs of the above mentioned animals heaped up to the size of the bed and place a bedstead over it, after the heap is burnt and has become smokeless.
62-63. Then, the person well anointed and well covered and made to lie on it, sweats happily. It is called the happy “Holaka” or happy under-bed sudation by the great sage. Thus the thermal methods have been described.
The Non-thermal Sudation
64-64½. Exercise, warm rooms, heavy clothing, hunger, excessive drinking, fear, wrath, plasters, war and sun-shine—these ten induce perspiration in a man without the agency of external fire.
The Regimen after Sudation (sveda)
65 66. Thus have been described the two varieties of sudation (sveda), the one thermal and the other non-thermal. Sudation—local or general, moist or dry—and thus the three dyads have been fully expatiated upon.
67. The person that has been subjected to sudation (sveda) after preliminary oleation and who has sweated well, must observe dietetic regimen. He that has undergone sudation must abstain from exercise that day.
Summary
Here are the recapitulatory verses:—
68-69. How sudation (sveda) becomes efficacious, unto whom and in what way it is so, what parts are to be protected and how the signs of successful sedation and of over-sudation, medications for over-sudation; those in whom sudation is not indicated; those iu whom it is indicated; the drugs used in sudation and their combination.
70. The thirteen modes of thermal and the ten modes of non-thermal sudation and the six fold grouping of sudation in brief, have all been described in the chapter on sudation (sveda).
71. All that has to be said in the matter of administering sudation procedure has been declared by the great sage. It is worthy of practice by the disciples as the teacher is none other than Punarvasu himself.
14. Thus, in the Section on General Principles, in the treatise compiled by Aguivesha and revised by Caraka, the fourteenth chapter entitled, “The Sudation Procedure (sveda)” is completed.
Purpose of the Armamentarium
3-(1). The physician who wishes to administer the procedure of emesis or purgation to a king or a person of kingly circumstance or a wealthy man, must keep ready, before beginning his treatment, his full armamentarium (upakalpa/upakalpana). If the procedure proves quite successful, the equipment will be of use in after-treatment, and if the procedure goes wrong, it will serve to help diagnosis and emergency treatment of complications arising during the course of treatment.
3. The equipment should be kept ready because it is not easy to obtain immediately the stock of remedies needed in the event of an emergency development of the disease, even if the means to buy them be available.
4-(1). Aguivesha said to the worshipful Atreya who had thus spoken—“O worshipful one! the wise physicians should administer medicine in such a way from the very outset, that it succeeds invariably. The proper application of remedies is always attended with the desired results of treatment while the ill effects result from improper application.
4. Under these circumstances, if treatment both well-administered and ill-administered, produces good or ill effects indeterminately, then knowledge and ignorance cease to have any distinction between them”.
5-(1). The worshipful Atreya replied to him, “O Agnivesha! it is given only to us or persons like us to administer remedies so as to make them infallible, and give exact instruction regarding their effective administration.
5-(2). But there is none who is able to grasp such instruction or having grasped it, is able to apply it or put it into practice.
5-(3). The difference in the variation of humoral discordance, drug, place, time, strength, body, food, homologation, mind, constitution and age are so minute that they baffle the understanding of even those whose intellect is clear and broad. It is needless, then, to speak about those whose understanding is only limited.
5. Therefore, both these viz., the correct application of drug and the means of emergency treatment in case of complicationsarising, we shall explain in detail, later on in the Section on “Success in Treatment.”
List of Accessories
6-(1). Here, therefore, we shall instruct, in brief, concerning the several accessories.
6. It is thus. The expert architect should first design a good house which is strong and is warding off the wind except on one side, affording comfortable moving space, not surrounded by high places, not penetrable to smoke, heat, moisture, dust and to undesirable noise, contact, taste, sight and odor and is furnished with a water storage, mortar and pestle, latrine, bath room and kitchen.
7-(1). Then, the following accessories should be kept ready viz., the attendants who have character, cleanliness, good conduct, affection, dexterity and sympathy, who are circumspect in all work, who are skilled in the cooking of soups and rice, in giving baths and shampoo, in lifting or laying -the patient in bed and in administering medicines, and who are not disinclined to any kind of work.
7-(2). Also those who are well-versed in singing, playing of musical instruments, panegyrics, verses, stories, legends, history and mythology, who are quick in understanding, who are of approved character, who are versed in the knowledge of clime and season and who are good members of society.
7-(3). He should also be equipped with quail, grey partridge, hare, deer, black buck, black-tailed deer, hog deer and wild sheep, and a milch cow. good tempered and healthy, having a living calf, and a good arrangement of grass, byre and water.
7-(4). Also a beaker, sipping spoon, tub, pot, cooking pot, pan, jug, pitcher, bowl, saucer, ladle, mat, coverplate, frying pan, churning staff, skins, cloth, yarn, cotton, wool etc.,
7-(5). beds and seats, kettle and spittoon, well-spread bed-sheets, coverlets and cushions with pillows, equipment for inclining, reclining, for oleation, sudation, inunction, application, affusion, anointment, for emesis, and purgation, for corrective enema, unctuous enemma, errhines and for micturition and defecation;
7-(6). well-washed roller stone, well-polished, hard and medium sized grinding slabs, instruments and other accessories, smoking pipe, enema tube, tube for urethral or vaginal douche, broom, balances and measuring vessels.
7-(7). Ghee, oil, animal fat, marrow, honey, treacle, salt, fuel, water, honey wine, Sidhu-wine and Sura-wine, Sauviraka wine, Tushodaka, Maireya and Medaka wines, curds, whey, diluted butter milk, sour gruel and urines;
7-(8). Shali rice, shashtika rice, green gram, black gram, barley, til, horse gram, jujube, grapes, white teak, sweet falsah, chebulic myrobalan, emblic myrobalan and beleric myrobalan.
7-(9). Also necessary materials of various kinds required for oleation and sudation procedures, drugs for purgation and for combined action, astringents and digestive stimulants, digestives, sedatives, drugs curative of Vata and other drugs described previously.
7. All the above accessories and others that may be considered useful as remedies in emergency treatment, should be kept ready, as also things that are useful in after-treatment.
Preparation before Emesis
8-(1). Thereafter, that person should be given the aforesaid oleation and sudation procedures as required.
8-(2). In the meanwhile, if any acute psychic or somatic complication suddenly assails him, the physician should concentrate on curing it first.
8. And having cured it, the procedure of treatment of emergency condition should be continued for as much time again, and in the same manner.
9. After the person has taken the oleation and sudation procedures, and he is of tranquil mind and has slept soundly, digested his food well, taken a full bath, anointed his body, worn a garland and untorn clothes, worshipped the deity, the fire, the brahmans, the guru, the elders and the physicians, he should be administered a dose of the decoction of emetic nut together with honey, liquorice, rock-salt and treacle, sanctified by the benediction of the “Svastivacana” chantings of the brahmins performed under an auspicious constellation, day, Karana and Muhurta.
The Dosage of the Emetic
10-(1). The dosage of the decoction ef the emetic-nut and the dosage of all the purificatory medicines are dependent upon individual patients.
10. That should be known to be the dosage for a person which, when taken for purification, leads to the elimination of morbid humors and does not produce symptoms of overdosage or under-dosage.
What Should Be Done after Giving the Dose
11–(l). After a person has taken the decoction, he should be under observation for a Muhurta; one should recognise the liquefaction of the morbid humor by the appearance of perspiration on the body, the dislodgement of morbid humors from their seats by horripilation, its reaching the stomach by the distension of the belly, its separation and upward course by retching and salivation.
11-(2). Then a seat, which is knee-high, not uncomfortable, furnished well with bed-spreads, coverlets, cushions and pillows, should be provided; spittoons should be laid nearby.
11. Affectionate and sympathetic friends before whom the patient is free from shyness, should endeavour to hold his forehead, to support his sides, to press his navel and to massage his back.
12. Then, he should be instructed to vomit without straining excessively by aiding the activated urge for vomiting, by opening wide the lips, the palate and the throat, by slighty bending the upper part of the body, by exciting the dormant urge, by tickling the throat with two well-manicured fingers or with stalks of blue lily, night lotus or white water lily; and the patient should do as bidden.
12. Next, the physician should carefully examine the vomited matter collected in the spittoon, because the expert finds out the particulars of the proper, improper or over administration by carefully examining the vomited matter. He who has examined the particulars of the vomited matter, knows from its nature, the necessary after-treatment. Therefore, the vomited matter should be carefully examined.
The Signs of Successful, Under and Over Action of the Emetic Dose
13-(1). Here are the characteristics of under-administration, proper administration and over-administration of emesis.
13-(2). Complete inaction or throwing out the whole emetic draught, or distorted action of the drug or the suppression of the urge is the indication of under-administration.
13-(3). Timely action, lack of great pain, elimination of the morbid humors in the right manner and the natural and timely cessation of vomiting are the indications of successful emesis by proper administration. According to the proportion of the vomit it is again classified as severe, moderate and mild.
13-(4). By over-administration, there comes frothy vomit tinged with blood. This is the indication of overadministration.
13. Know these to be the diseases resulting from over and under administration viz,, distension of the abdomen, griping pain, ptyalism, palpitation, rigidity of the body, hematemesis, prolapse of the organs, stiffness and exhaustion.
The After-Treatment
14. After he has vomited well as a consequence of the proper administration of emesis, washed his hands, feet and face, and has rested for a Muhurta, the patient should be made to smoke any one of the three kinds of smokes—unctuous, errhine or sedative, such as is suitable for him, and be made to wash again.
15-(1). After he has washed, he must be conducted into a house protected from wind, and being laid in bed, he should be instructed thus:
15. “Spend the day without inclining the mind to these viz., loud speech, excessive eating, standing long, walking much, anger, grief, cold, heat, fog, strong winds, riding in vehicles, sex-act, night-vigil, day-sleep, eating food that is antagonistic, eating predigestion-meal, taking a meal that is unwholesome, untimely, too little in quantity, low of quality, heavy and uncongenial, and the suppression and excitation of the urges”. He should act accordingly.
The Rehabilitatory Diet after Emesis
16-(1). Then, in the evening or on the following day, after he has bathed in genially warm water, he should be given first the tepid and thin gruel of well-cooked, old and red shali rice, the supernatent part being taken first, with due consideration to the strength of his digestive fire. The same course should be repeated at the second and third meal-times.
16-(2). While at the fourth mealtime he should be given the well-cooked thick gruel of the same kind of Shali rice mixed with or without a little of unctuous substance and salt in it, followed by a potion of warm water. The same course should be repeated at the fifth and the sixth meal-times.
16-(3). Again at the seventh mealtime, he should be given two Prasritas (16 tolas) of well-cooked rice of the same quality with a potion of warm water together with thin green-gram-soup mixed with a little of unctuous substance and salt. The same course should be followed at the eighth and the ninth meal-times.
16-(4). At the tenth mealtime he should be given rice with not too thick meat-juice of any one of quail and partridge group, cooked in water and salt, followed by a potion of warm water. The same course should be repeated at the eleventh and twelfth mealtimes.
16.Thence-forward he should take gradually to the normal diet, and in seven nights should return fully to his normal diet.
The Purgation Procedure
17-(1). Then, he should be once more treated with oleation and sudation procedures. Afterwards, finding him to be cheerful, to have slept well, to have fully digested his meal, to have performed Homa and Bali and auspicious rites, repeated the holy names and practised penance, the brahmanas should be brought to give “Svasti” benediction, on an auspicious day and time, and then he should be given a drink of the paste of turpeth, of the dosage of an Aksha (1 tola) mixed with some suitable liquid, with due consideration to the morbid humor, drug, clime, season, vitality, physique, diet, homologation, mind, habitus, age of the patient and stage of the disease.
17-(2). When he has been well purged, he should be treated until he has acquired vitality, complexion and normal condition, in accordance with the procedure of emesis leaving out the item of inhalation.
17. On finding that he has regained his vitality, complexion and cheerfulness of mind, and after he has slept happily, digested his food well, taken a full bath, and laved the body with sandal, has put on garlands and untorn clothes, and has adorned himself with befitting ornaments, he should be shown round to his kinsmen after being presented to his friends. Thenceforward, he should be left to resume bis normal activities.
Here are verses again—
18. Only those, who are kings or of kingly circumstance; or men of abundant wealth can be given the purgation procedure in this manner.
19. But when a poor man, afflicted with an ailment, has need of purification, he should take whatever drugs are within his reach, leaving those that are beyond him.
20. All men do not command all the facilities; and it is not as if severe ailments do not afflict the poor.
21. People should avail themselves of whatever is possible for them to obtain of drugs, clothes and food, in the moment of distress.
The Merits of Purification therapy
22. One acquires long life by taking properly the purificatory treatment that cleanses one of impurities, dispels diseases and restores vitality and complexion.
Summary
Here are the recapitulatory verses:—
23. Emesis and purgation procedures for kings and the wealthy; the appurtenances, and for what specific purposes these should be brought and administered;
24. the proper method of administration and the dosage, the symptoms of under-administration and those of right and of over-administration as well as of the morbid humors and of complications;
25. what is not wholesome for one that has been cleansed, the dietetic regimen in rehabilitation—all this, has been laid down by Punarvasu in this chapter on “The Armamentarium of the Physician.”
15. Thus, in the Section on General Principles in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the fifteenth chapter entitled, “The Armamentarium (upakalpa/upakalpana) of the Physician,” is completed.
The Merits of Purification Administered by an Expert
3. When a fully equipped physician, gifted, learned and skilled in practice, administers the procedure of purification to a person, that person, obtaining the right treatment, acquires good health thereby.
The Evils of the Same Administered By a Quack
4. When a pretentious and ignorant physician administers the procedure of purification to a man, that than, getting either under-treatment
or over-treatment, falls a victim to disease.
The Signs of Successful Purgation
5-6. Weakness, lightness, depression, attenuation of the disease, promotion of taste, clarification, purification of the stomach and complexion, feeling of hunger and thirst, regularity of natural urges, clearness of understanding, sense-organs and of mind, regular peristalsis and restoration of bodytemperature are the signs of successful purgation.
The Signs of Unsuccessful Purgation
7. Salivation, impurity of the stomach, precipitation of Kapha and Pitta, distension of the abdomen, anorexia, vomiting, absence of weakness and lightness,
8. flabbiness of the calf-muscle and the thigh, torpor, stiffness, onset of rhinitis and impediment to the function of Vata are the signs of unsuccessful purgation.
The Signs of Excessive Purgation
9-10. The signs of over-purgation are—after the discharge of feces, bile, mucus and flatus successively, an excessive amount of blood of the appearance of fat and of flesh-washed water or fluid devoid of any mucus or bile flows out, or dark blood comes out, or the person gets afflicted with Vata or suffers from thirst and faints.
The Signs of Excessive Emesis
11. The very same symptoms appear in the case of over-action of emesis too. In addition, there appear disorders of Vata affecting the supraclavicular parts of the body and impediment of speech.
12. A man, therefore, should resort to the shelter of one who is a fully equipped physician (Cikitsa-prabhrita—cikitsā-prābhṛta) who will confer on his client long life and happiness.
Conditions In Which The Purification Therapy Is Indicated
13-16. Indigestion, anorexia, corpulence, anemia, heaviness, exhaustion, pimples, wheals, pruritus, malaise, indolence, fatigue, debility, fetor, flabbiness, precipitation of Kapha and Pitta, insomnia, hypersomnia, torpor, impotency, dullness of understanding, evil dreams, and loss of vigor and color in spite of impletion through roborant therapy, are the signs of excessive morbidity. In such conditions are indicated the purificatory procedures of emesis and purgation in accordance with the morbidity of the humors and vitality of the patient.
17. When a person is thus purified, his body-heat increases, his disorders disappear and his normal health returns.
18. His senses, mind, understanding and complexion become clear and he acquires vigor, plumpness, offsprings and virility.
19. His aging is retarded and he lives a long life free of disease. There fore, a person should take purificatory procedures at the proper time and skilfully administered.
Reasons for Purification to Precede the Sedative therapy
20. The morbid humors subdued by lightening therapy and digestives may sometimes be again provoked; but in the case of those which are subdued by purificatory procedures, there is no possibility of such recurrence.
21. When the root of the morbid humors like that of trees is not destroyed, there certainly occurs the reappearance of disease like that of the sprouts from plant roots.
Regimen of Diet after Purification
22-23. To those weakened by purificatory, medication, roboration is to be done by wholesome food, viz., by a diet including ghee, meat-juice, milk and palatable soups, as well as by inunction, unctuous massage, bath and evacuative and unctuous enemata. In this way, he gets endowed with happiness and long life.
Treatment of the Overdone and Under done Conditions of Purificatory therapy
24. To those suffering from the effects of overdone purificatory procedure, a potion of ghee is recommended, or unctuous enemata with the oil prepared with drugs of the sweet group.
25. But one who is under-purged should be oleated and purged again with due regard to dose, season and strength of the patient, with the deficiencies of the previous procedure kept in view.
26. The treatment of the complications that arise from the wrong administration of oleation, sudation, purification and rehabilitation procedures will be described in the section on “Success in Treatment.”
The Cessation of Life Is the Nature of Things
27. The body-elements become discordant as a result of the discordance of the causative factors. Conversely, they become concordant following upon the concordance of the causative factors. Cessation of existence, however, is always in the course of nature.
28. As regards their rise, things stand in need of a cause, but no cause is needed for their cessation. Even in the latter case, some however hold the very non-continuance of their causative factors as the cause of their cessation.
Agnivesha’s Query Regarding the Purpose of Treatment
29. The master having thus spoken, Agnivesha said—“If cessation be in the very nature of things, what is there then to be done by the fully equipped physician (Cikitsa-prabhrita—cikitsā-prābhṛta)?
30. What discordant body-elements does a physician harmonise by medicine? What is treatment and for what purpose is it given?”
Atreya’s answer
31. Hearing these words, Punarvasu said—“Hear, O, good one! what reason the great sages have seen in this respect.
32-32½. The cause of things ceasing to be is not known for the simple reason that no such cause exists as in the case of the passage of time. Being evanescent by nature, things cease to be, even as they are born.
33. Thus, there is no question of a cause for a thing ceasing to be, nor indeed of modifying this innate tendency to extinction.
The Function Of Treatment And Of The Physician
34. The treatment of disorders, therefore, consists of such operations as give rise to the concordance of body elements. This is regarded as the function of the physician.
The Object of Treatment
35. Treatment is given with the object of ensuring that no discordance arises in the various body-elements and that there is continuance of their concordance.
36. By avoiding things that give rise to discordance and practising those that help concordance, the discordant elements do not persist and the concordant elements are continually brought into existence.
The Merits of the Gifted Physician
37. Because he effects the concordance of the body-elements by using the concordant means, the expert in treatment becomes the giver of bodily happiness and longevity.
38. By the gift of bodily happiness and long life, the physician becomes the donor of righteousness, wealth and satisfaction of desires pertaining to both the worlds of man.
Summary
Here are the recapitulatory verses:—
39. The benefits that accrue from the fully equipped physician (Cikitsa-prabhrita—cikitsā-prābhṛta) as against the harm done by the quack; the signs of properly done, under-done and overdone purificatory procedures;
40. the signs of excessive morbidity; the advantages of purification; the general principles of treatment, basic principles of therapeutic procedures and successful methods in complicated conditions;
41. the rationale of therapeutics and the object with which a physician administers it—all this has been described by the sage in this chapter on “The fully equipped Physician.”
16. Thus, in the Section on General Principles in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the sixteenth chapter entitled “The fully equipped physician (Cikitsa-prabhrita—cikitsā-prābhṛta),” is completed.
4. Thus, the tetrad of chapters dealing with the pharmaceutical equipment is completed.
Agnivesa’s Query Regarding the diseases of the Head (shiroroga).
3-4. How many are said to be the diseases of the head (Shiroroga—śiroroga) and of the heart (Hridroga—hṛdroga) afflicting humanity and how many are the disorders produced by the varied combinations of discordant Vata and other humors? How many are the wasting diseases enumerated, and how many are the inflammatory swellings? O, holy one! and how many are said to be the courses of the humors, O, dispeller of morbid humors!
Atreya’s Reply
5. Having heard these words of Agnivesha, the Master said, “O, gentle one! hear me describe in detail all that you have asked.
6. Five types of diseases of the head (shiroroga) are observed to exist and five of the heart; there are sixty-two disorders classified according to minute pathological variations in the humors.
7. There are eighteen varieties of wasting diseases, seven inflammatory swellings caused by diabetes, and three are the courses of the humors. Now hear them in detail.
The Etiology and Onset of Head Diseases
8-11. By suppression of the natural urges, by day-sleep, waking at night, intoxication, talking too loud, exposure to frost, and facing headwinds, excess of the sex-act, inhalation of unwholesome odors, by dust, smoke, cold, heat, over-eating of heavy and sour articles and greens, by the use of very cold water, by trauma of the head, morbid chyme, excessive weeping, supression of tears, onset of rains, mental affliction and abnormal clime and season, the Vata and other humors are provoked and the blood in the head gets vitiated. Consequently diseases with various symptoms afflict the head.
12 The limb wherein are situated the vital centres of living creatures, which is the seat of all senses and which is the best of all the limbs of the body, is named the Head.
Their Names
13. Hemicrania, aching of the whole head, coryza, diseases of the mouth, nose, eyes and ears, giddness [giddiness?],
14. facial paralysis, head-tremor, spasm of throat, neck or of jaws—these and various others are the diseases born of morbid Vata and other humors and of parasitic infection.
The Etiology and Symptoms of the Vata Types of head Diseases
15. Listen as I describe the five head-diseases with their particular causes and symytoms and which are described by the great sages separately in the chapter entitled “Enumeration of Diseases.”
16 18. By loud speech, excessive talk, strong drinks, waking at night, excessive sex-act, suppression of natural urges, fasting, trauma, severe purgation and vomiting and by excessive weeping, grief, fear, terror, loadcarrying, way-faring and severe emaciation, when the increased Vata entering the vessels of the head, gets provoked, there occurs severe aching pain in the head due to morbid Vata.
19-21. There is intense pain in both the temples, splitting sensation in the nape, excessive heat and pain in the forehead and in the inter-superciliary region; there occur pain and noises in the ear, a feeling in the eyes as of being extracted, whirling in the head and a sense of separatedness in all the joints. The vessels throb excessively and the neck becomes stiffened; and unctuous and hot things become homologatory in the headache of the Vata type.
The Etiology and Symptoms of the Pitta Types of Diseases
22. The Pitta lodged in the head, being much vitiated by the use of pungent and acid articles, salt, alkali, wine and by anger, heat and fire, causes disorders of the head.
23. In this condition, there is heat and pain in the head, a desire for cold things, burning sensation in the eyes, and there occur also thirst, giddiness and perspiration.
The Etiology and Symptoms of the Kapha Diseases
24. As a consequence of indulgence in a sedentary life and sleep and the it take of a heavy, unctuous and excessive diet, the Kapha gets vitiated and provoked in the head and causes general diseases of the head (shiroroga).
25. In this condition there occur mild pain, numbness, stiffness and heaviness in the head as also torpor, indolence and anorexia.
The Etiology and Symptoms of the Tridiscordance Type
26.In the diseases of the head paused by tridiscordance, aching pain, giddiness and tremors occur due to Vata, burning sensation, intoxication and thirst due to Pitta, and heaviness and torpor due to Kapha.
The Etiology and Symptoms of the Parasytic Type
27. By taking til, milk and gur in excess by taking predigestion-meal of eating putrified or promiscuous food, there occurs pathological softening of blood Kapha and flesh in the body of one whose humor is already vitiated
28. Then, the parasites born in the pabulum of the pathologically soft, ened tissues in the head of this sinful man; give rise to diseases of the head (shiroroga), attended with dreadful symptoms.
29 The patient with parasitic infection of the head is to be recognised by the piercing, cutting or aching pains, by itching swelling, and fetor and by the presence of parasites,
The Etiology and Symptoms of the Vata Type of Cardiac Diseases (hridroga)
30. Owing to grief, fasting and over-exercise and un-unctuous, dry and scanty meals, the Vata enters the heart and causes severe pain.
31. Tremors, cardiac cramps, pauses in cardiac beats, stupor, sensation of a void in the cardiac region, tachycardia and exceedingly severe pain on completion of digestion are the symptoms of cardiac disease due to Vata.
The Etiology and Symptoms of the Pitta Type of Cardiac Diseases (hridroga)
32. The Pitta is quickly provoked in the heart by the intake of hot, acid, salt, alkaline and pungent articles of diet, by eating predigestionmeal, by alcohol, anger and exposure to the heat of the sun.
33. Heart-burn (Hriddaha—hṛddāha), bitter taste in the mouth, bitter and acid eructations, exhaustion, thirst, fainting, giddiness, and perspiration are the symptoms of cardiac disease due to Pitta [pitta-hṛdroga].
The Etiology and Symptoms of the Kapha Type of Cardiac Diseases (hridroga)
34. Over-eating, heavy and fatty meals, care-free life, sedentary habits and over-indulgence in sleep are the causes of cardiac disease due to Kapha [kapha-hṛdroga].
35. In cardiac affection due to Kapha there occur numbness, stiffness, heaviness, and a sensation of pressure on all sides of the cardiac region as if pressed by a stone, while the person is afflicted with torpor and anorexia.
The Etiology and Symptoms of the Tridiscordance Type
35½. Cardiac disease is said to be due to tridiscordance when there is a combination of the above causes and the symptoms. (This cardiac disease is said to be very troublesome and formidable, by the great sages.)
The Etiology and Symptoms of the Parasitic Type
36-37. If the unfortunate man, lacking self-control and already affected by cardiac disease due to tridiscordance, uses til, milk, gur and similar articles in excess, there arises an excrescent growth in some region of his heart.
38. This becomes softened and from the softened tissue in this vital organ are formed worm-like things (emboli) which spread in the entire body of this suicidal man and consume him.
39. He feels as if the heart is pierced by needles or cut by weapons, and experiences great irritation and pain in the heart.
40. Diagnosing by the help of these symptoms the very serious cardiac affection (hridroga) caused by worm-like emboli, the wise physician should hasten to subdue this fulminating disease.
Sixty-two Discordant Conditions
41-42. There are thirteen conditions of tri-discordance caused by the increase of morbid humors; there are three conditions where two humors are excessively increased; there are three conditions where one humor is excessively increased; there are six conditions where one humor is slightly, another moderately and the third excessively increased; and a condition where all the three humors are equally increased. There are nine conditions of bidiscordance with morbid increase of two humors; six conditions where one of the two humors is excessively increased, and three conditions where both are equally increased. There are three conditions of monodiscordance with morbid increase of one humor only; there are three conditions where only one humor is excessively increased. All these discordances, with morbid increase of humors, make twenty-five conditions in all.
43. Just as with morbid increase of humors, so with morbid decrease of humors, it will make again twenty-five conditions of discordance. Now we shall describe another class of discordant condition which is different from the former class, where there is increase or decrease of one humor only.
44. There are six conditions where one humor is increased, another is normal and the third is diminished; another group of three conditions where two humors are increased and the third is diminished and one more group of three, where one humor is increased and two others are diminished. (These groups of mixed discordances make twelve disorders, so twenty-five of increase, twenty-five of decrease and twelve of mixed discordances form sixty-two of them in all.)
The Symptoms of the Increase and Decrease of Humors and their Combinations
45-46. In a condition where Pitta is normal, Kapha is decreased and Vata. is increased, whenever the increased Vata, attracting the normal Pitta from its seat, carries it and spreads it in the body, there will be unstable breaking and burning, as also fatigue and weakness of the region which has been affected thus.
47.In a condition where Kapha is normal, Vata is increased and Pitta is decreased, if the increased Vata attracts Kapha, it produces colicky pain, cold, stiffness and heaviness.
48. In a condition where Vata is normal, Pitta has increased, and Kapha is decreased, if the increased Pitta obstructs Vata, it then produces burning and colicky pain.
49. In a condition where Kapha is normal, Pitta is increased and Vata is decreased, if the increased Pitta obstructs Kapha, it causes fever attended with torpor and heaviness.
50. In a condition where Kapha is increased, Pitta is decreased and Vata is normal, if the increased Kapha obstructs Vata, it cause chill, heaviness and pain.
51-52. In a condition where Vata is decreased, Pitta is normal and Kapha is increased, if the increased Kapha obstructs Pitta, it causes lowering of the gastric fire, stiffness of the head, excessive sleep, torpor, delirium, cardiac disorders (hridroga), heaviness of limbs, icteric tinge of nails etc., and spitting of mucus and bile.
53-54 In a condition where Vata is decreased, and Pitta and Kapha are increased, the increased Pitta and Kapha, spreading together in the body, produce anorexia, indigestion, asthenia, heaviness, nausea, salivation, anemia, burning, intoxication, irregularity of bowels and irregularity of gastric fire.
55-56. In a condition where Pitta is decreased and Kapha and Vata are increased, the increasad Kapha and Vata combined together will produce stiffness, coldness, unstable pricking pain, heaviness, lowering of gastric fire, disinclination for food, tremors, pallor of nails etc., and roughness of the limb.
57. Listen as I describe in brief, the symptoms produced by the provocation of Vata and Pitta in a condition where Kapha is decreased and Vata and Pitta are increased.
58, They are—giddiness, cramps, pricking pain, burning pain, disruption, tremors, body-ache, dehydration, burning and steaming.
59. In a condition where there is decrease of Vata and Pitta, and Kapha is increased, the increased Kapha, filling and thus obstructing the channels greatly, produces complete loss of movement and fainting, as also loss of speech.
60. In a condition where Vata and Kapha are decreased and Pitta is increased, the increased Pitta while pervading the whole body causes loss of vital essence and produces depression, asthenia of sense organs, thirst, fainting and loss of movement.
61. In a condition where Pitta and Kapha are decreased, the increased Vata, compressing the vital centres, destroys consciousness or convulses the whole body.
The Symptoms of the increase, Decrease and Normalcy of the Humors
62. The humors when increased, manifest their pathognomic symptoms in proportion to the intensity of their morbidity; when decreased, they cease manifesting their characteristic qualities and when normal they perform the normal functions of the body.
63. There are eighteen conditions of wasting viz., three of the humors, seven of body-elements, seven of body-excrements, and one of vital essence. Of these the conditions of decrease of Vata and other humors and their symptoms have been already described.
The Symptoms of the Decrease of the Nutrient Fluid and Other Body-Elements
64. The symptoms of loss of the nutrient fluid are restlessness, intolerance to loud sounds, acceleration of flow, tachy-cardiac pain and distress even on the slightest exertion.
65. The symptoms of loss of blood are roughness, cracks, withering and dryness of skin; the symptoms of loss of flesh are thinning in general and specially on the hips, neck and belly.
66. The symptoms of loss of fat are the cracking of the joints, lassitude in the eyes, exhaustion and thinning of the abdomen.
67. The symptoms of the atrophy of osteo-tissues are the falling of hair, nail and teeth, fatigue and looseness of joints.
68. The symptoms of loss of marrow are the atrophy of bone-tissue which becomes weak and light; and the patient is afflicted with chronic Vata disorders.
69. The symptoms of wasting of semen are debility, dryness of the mouth, pallor, asthenia, fatigue, impotency and non-emission.
70. In a condition of deficient formation of feces (acoprosis), the Vata, causing painful peristalsis in the intestines and distending the stomach, spreads upwards and obliquely, in a dehydrated person.
71. The symptoms of deficient formation of urine are dysuria, discoloration of urine, oppressive thirst and dryness of the entire month.
72. The symptoms of the deficient formation of the other excretions are emptiness, lightness and dryness of the receptacles of each of the excretions.
73. The symptoms of lose of the. vital essence are timidity, debility, constant worry, discomfort of the senses, loss of lustre, neurasthenia, dryness and emaciation.
74. The white and slightly red yellowish fluid which is lodged in the heart is called the Vital essence of the body. Owing to its loss, a man dies.
75. The vital essence is the first thing created in the body of all living beings; its color is like that of ghee, its taste is like that of honey, and its smell is like that of roasted paddy.
(1. As honey is collected by bees from various fruits and flowers, so is the vital essence collected by the inherent vital qualities of man from the various physiological processes which take place in the body.)
General Causes of Wasting
76-77. Over-exercise, fasting, worries, taking dry, scanty and limited meals, exposure to wind and sun, fear, grief, dry beverages, excessive waking, excessive discharge of mucus, blood, semen and excretion, season or age and possession by spirits are to be known as the causes of wasting.
The Etiology of Diabetes Mellitus
78-79. By taking in excess heavy, unctuous, acid and salt articles, by using fresh eats and drinks, by over-indulgence in sleep and sedentary habits, by avoidance of all exercise and worry, by not doing seasonal purification, the Kapha, Pitta, fat and flesh increase excessively.
80. When the Vata, getting obstructed by them in its course, attracts the vital essence and carries it to the renal region, then the formidable disorder of diabetes is born.
The Symptoms of Diabetes Mellitus
81. There occurs frequent manifestation of symptoms of Vata, Pitta and Kapha and. the force of the disease becomes lessened for a time and becomes aggravated again.
Inflammatory Swellings Due to Neglected Diabetes
82. If this diabetic condition is neglected, seven kinds of serious inflammatory swellings are produced in the fleshy spaces, vital organs and in the joints.
The Names of the Seven Swellings
83. Their names are Sharavika [Śarāvikā], Kacchapika [Kacchapikā], Jalini [Jālinī], Sarshapi [Sarṣapī], Alaji [Alajī], Vinata [Vinatā] and the seventh, Vidradhi [Vidradhī].
The Description of the Crateriform Ulcer
84.Sharavika or the crateriform ulcer is that where the edges are raised, surface is depressed, color is dusky-red and which is accompanied with slough and pain; it is called Sharavika because of its resemblanc to a Sharava [Śarāva]—earthen saucer, in shape.
The Description of the Carbuncle
85. The Kacchapika or carbuncle is that which is deeply infiltrated, painful, pricking and very extensive in size and shining; it is called Kacchapika because of its resemblance to the back of a “Kacchapa” or a tortoise.
The Description of the Cribriform Swelling
86. Jalini or the cribriform condition of swelling is that where the swelling is hard, is covered with a net-work of vessels, has thick discharge, is extensive, very painful and pricking, containing minute openings over the surface. It is called Jalini because of its resemblance to a “Jala” [Jāla]—a net-work.
The Description of the Slowly Suppurating Boil
87. Sarshapi or boil is that which is not very big, quickly suppurating, very painful and surrounded by secondary boils of the appearance of rapeseeds. It is called Sarshapi because it is surrounded by secondary boils of the appearance of Sarshapa [Sarṣapa]—a rape-seed.
The Description of the Dry Gangrene
88. Alaji or dry gangrene is that which commences with burning of the skin and is accompanied with thirst, delusion and fever, aud which steadily spreads in the body aud causes burning. It is said to be Alaji because the world Alaji is derived from “√laj” meaning to fry.
The Description of the Moist Gangrene
89. Vinata or moist gangrene is that which is deeply painful, softened, situated either on the back or on the abdomen, extensive, depressed and blue. It is said to be Vinata because it is Vi-nata [Vi-natā] which means “depressed” or “deep”.
The Two Types of Abscess
90. Vidradhi or abscess is described to be of two kinds—external abscess and internal abscess. The external one forms in the skin, muscle and flesh. It is of the appearance of Kandara [Kaṇḍarā], a muscular swelling and is very painful.
The Pathology of Abscess
91-94. By excessive use of cold, irritant, hot, dry and dehydrated articles of diet, by antagonistic diet, by eating pre-digestion meals and by vitiated or irregular or unwholesome diet, by taking in excess strong wines, by suppression of natural urges, by fatigue, distorted postures in exercise and in bed, by carrying heavy loads, by excessive wayfaring and excessive sex-activity, when the vitiated humors enter the muscular tissue and the blood of the internal parts of the body, they give rise to serious swelling in the deep regions of the body; and this circular acutely painful inflammatory swelling may occur in the heart, pharynx, liver, spleen, stomach, kidney, navel, groin or bladder.
The Definition of Vidradhi
95. Owing to excess of vitiated blood, this swelling quickly softens and suppurates and hence owing to its quickly suppurating characteristics it is called Vidradhi.
The Symptoms of the internal Abscess
96-97. It should be known to be an abscess of Vata type if there is piercing or cutting pain, giddiness, constipation, sound, throbbing or spreading tendency; to be of Pitta type if there is thirst, burning pain, stupefaction, toximia and fever; and to be of Kapha type if there is yawning, retching, anorexia rigidity and chill; while in the abscesses of all types there is intense pain.
The Symptoms of the maturated Abscess
98. When the abscess is ripening, there occurs pain as if cut by a weapon or as if burnt by a live coal or as if stung by a scorpion.
The Discharge From the Abscess
99-100. The discharge in an abscess of Vata is thin, un-unctuous, dusky red and frothy. In an abscess of Pitta type it is of the appearance of the decocted w?ter of til or black gram, and in that of Kapha type it is whitish, slimy, thick and profuse, and in that of tridiscordance type all the above characteristics appear combined.
Peculiar Symptoms Relative to its Site
101-(1). For the differential diagnosis of curability or incurability of these abscesses we shall describe characteristic symptoms according to the site of the abscess.
101. In an absce‘ss occurring in the principal vital organ, the heart, there will be cardiac flutter, asthma, stupefaction, cough and dyspnea. In the abscess occurring in the pharynx there will be thirst, dryness of mouth and throat-spasm. In an abscess of the liver, there will be dyspnea, In the abscess of the spleen, there will be impediment to breathing In the abscess of the stomachy there will be pain referred to the region between the stomach and the side extending upto the shoulder. In the abscess occurring in the kidneys, there will be rigidity of the back and waist. In the abscess occurring in the umbilical region, there will be hiccup. In the abscess occurring In the groins, there will be weakness of the thigh. In the abscess occurring in the bladder there will be painful micturition and defecation, and putrid urine and feces.
102. When the abscesses situated in the upper part of the body are ripe and burst open, they discharge through the mouth. The abscesses occurring in the lower part do so through the anus, and those situated in the middle part may discharge through either of the channels.
Diagnosis and Treatment of Curable and incurable Types
103-(1). Out of these, the abscesses of the heart, umbilicus and the bladder and those born of tridiscordance, if they suppurate, prove fatal. The remaining ones, treated immediately by an expert will be cured.
103. Therefore, immediately on appearance, au abscess which is just like a weapon, serpent, lightning or fire in action, should be prepared instantaneously with oleation and sudation procedures and should be treated like a Gulma in all respects.
Inflammatory Swellings Occur even Without Diabetes
Here are verses again—
104. Even without diabetes, such abscesses may occur in a person owing to vitiation of his adipose tissue. These are not observable till they become extensive in size,
105. The crateriform, tortoise-form and cribriform inflammatory swellings develop very intensively in persons with excessive Kahpa and fat, and become unbearable.
106. Boils, dry gangrene, moist gangrene and abscess occur in persons with meagre fat and are curable. They are caused by excess of Pitta.
107. A diabetic getting inflammatory swelling in his vital parts, shoulder, rectum, hands, breast, joints and feet, does not survive.
Some Other Varieties of Swellings
108-109. There are also some other varieties of inflammatory swellings. They may be red, yellow, dark, dusky-red, grey, yellowish, white, ash-colored or blackish in appearance. Some are soft and some are indurated. Some are very big and some are minute. Some are quickly developing and some are slowly developing. Some are attended with severe pain and some are attended with mild pain.
110. Diagnosing them by their respective causative factors and characteristic symptoms of Vata and other humors, one should declare their nature and treat them quickly before the development of complications.
The Complications
111. Thirst, dyspnea, sloughing of flesh, stupor, hiccup, toximia, fever, acute spreading affections and obstruction of the functions of vital organs are the complications of inflammatory swellings.
112. Decrease, normality and increase are the three courses of the humors. Again upward, downward and transverse are to be regarded as the other three courses of the humors.
113. There are three courses from another point of view. Alimentary tract or the Central, secondly Peripheral and thirdly the Vital organs, bones and joints. Thus have been described the threefold courses of the humors, according to different modes of classification.
The Seasons of Accumulation, Provocation and Abatement of the Humors
114-114½. Accumulation, provocation and sedation of Pitta and other humors occur individually and respectively in the six seasons beginning with the rainy season. These courses of accumulation etc., are described to be seasonal.
Their Physiological and Pathological Courses
115-118. The courses are seen to be of two kinds—physiological and pathological. It is by the heat of Pitta that digestion takes place in men, and when that very Pitta is in a provoked condition, it causes various diseases. The normal Kapha constitutes the body-strength while the morbidised Kapha becomes a vitiated element. It is said to be the vital essence of the body when normal, while it is described to be the source of ailment when morbid. All the life-activities of the body are performed by the normal Vata which is said to be the very life of living beings. Diseases are caused by that very Vata when morbidized and even the cessation of life is caused by such Vata.
119. The self-controlled man desiring to live the full span of life should live with great caution knowing himself to be constantly surrounded by forces hostile to his health.
Summary
Here are the two recapitulatory verses:—
120-121. The diseases of the head (shiroroga), the diseases of the heart, diseases caused by minute pathological conditions of humors, wasting, inflammatory swellings and courses of the humors: all these are described in this chapter entitled “How many are the diseases of the head”, by the well-wisher of mankind and the great seer, for the enlightenment of the physicians.
17. Thus, in the Section on General Principles in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the seventeenth chapter entitled,“How many are the Diseases of the Head (shiroroga),” is completed.
The Varieties of Edema (shotha)
3. There are three kinds of edema (shotha) caused by Vata, Pitta and Kapha respectively. They are again classified into two groups as those caused by endogenous and exogenous causes.
The Etiology of the Exogenous Edema
4. Of these the causes of exogenous edema are physical, such as injuries due to excision, incision, comminution, fracture, contusion, pounding, blow, concussion, binding, ligaturing, piercing, compression and similar ones; chemical or toxic causes such as juice of the flower and fruit of marking nut, bristles of cowage, bristles of prickly insect, poisonous plants, leaves and creepers; poisons such as sweat, urine or discharge and crawling of poisonous animals, bite and injury by fangs, teeth, horns and claws of venomous animals; climatic causes such as marine and other poisonous winds; tactual causes such as touch of frost or fire.
Its Treatment
5. In the beginning, it is known by the characteristic signs of injury differing from edema caused by endogenous factors, as it is localised in one region. It subsides when treated with such remedies as bandaging, incantations, medicines, applications, heat, refrigeration and such other treatment.
The General Etiology of the Endogenous Edema
6. The causes of endogenous edema are—Improper administration or wrongful use of oleation and sudation, emesis, purgation, corrective and unctuous enemata, errhines, wrongful rehabilitation regimen, extreme emaciation caused by vomiting, intestinal torpor, acute intestinal irritation, dyspnea, cough, diarrhea, consumption, anemia, abdominal diseases, fever, leucorrhea, fistula-inano and piles; or dermatosis, pruritus, pimples; or the suppression of the urges for vomiting, sneezing, eructation, seminal ejaculation, flatus, urine and feces; or emaciation due to over-dose of purificatory procedures, disease, fasting, and excessive walking; or indiscriminate and excessive use of heavy and acid articles, salt, pastry, fruits, vegetables, Raga-preparation, curds, greens, wine, immature curds, sprouted and new com and cereals and flesh of wet land and aquatic animals, or eating clay, mud and sods; eating too much of common salt; pressure of gravid uterus, abortion, wrongful puerperal regimen; the precipitations of the morbid humors—these causes produce the various types of edema. Thus have been described the.pauses in general.
The Causes and symptoms of Edema of the Vata Type (vatashotha)
7-(1). These are its distinctive characteristics. Vata, provoked by the over use of cold, dry, light, and clear articles, or by fatigue, fasting, extreme emaciation and purgation etc., pervades the skin, flesh, blood and the other tissues and produces edema (shotha). The edema appears and disappears abruptly. It is of dusky red or normal skin color. It is migratory and throbbing. The skin and hair become rough, harsh and broken. There is painful sensation as if the part is excised or incised, compressed or pricked by needles or crawled upon by ants, There is tingling sensation as if painted with mustard paste or there is contraction or expansion. These are the symptoms of edema caused by Vata (Vatashotha—vātaśotha).
The Causes and Symptoms of Edema of the Pitta Type (pittashotha)
7-(2). The Pitta provoked by the use of hot, acute, pungent and alkaline, or salt and acid articles of diet, by predigestion meals, by the severe heat of fire or sun, pervades the skin, blood and flesh and produces edema, which appears and disappears abruptly. It is of dark, yellowish, purple or coppery tinge. It is warm and soft. Hairs become tawny or of coppery color. There is a sensation of heat, parching, fuming or steaming. The part sweats and is softened and does not tolerate touch and heat.
The Causes and Symptoms of Edema of the Kapha Type (kaphashotha)
7-(3) The Kapha, provoked by the use of heavy, sweet, cold and unctuous articles of diet, excessive sleep, and avoidance of excercise etc., pervades the skin, flesh, blood and the other tissues and produces edema. It is slow in onset and subsidence. It is of pale whitish tinge. It is thick, greasy, smooth, firm and dense. On it, hairs appear which are white at their tips and it has tolerance to touch and heat. These are the signs of edema caused by Kapha (Kaphashotha—kaphaśotha).
The Causes and Symptoms of Edema of the Tridiscordance Type
7. There are three kinds of edema caused by bi-discordance due to admixture of causes and symptoms of the two humors concerned. Only one kind of edema is caused by the discordance due to symptosis of respective causes and symptoms of all the three humors. Thus in all they are of seven varieties.
The Different Classifications of Edema (shotha)
8. Being thus classified according to the difference in their causative factors, they become grouped as bipartite, tripartite, quadrupartite, septa-partite and octopartite. But they are all one, swelling being their common pathognomic symptom.
Definitions of the Vata and Other Types of Edema (shotha)
Here are verses again—
9. That edema (shotha) is to be regarded as the one due to Vata wherein the limbs are swollen and there is alternately numbness and pain in the swelling and which, when pressed with the finger and left, returns instantaneously to its normal level.
10. That which is light-red in appearance, which is lessened at night due to rest and which disappears when massaged with unctuous and hot substances, is also an edema due to Vata.
11. That edema (shotha) is regarded as born of Pitta wherein the patient is afflicted with thirst and fever, and there is pain and burning sensation in the swelling, as well as sweating, softening and smell.
12. That again is said to be edema due to Pitta wherein there is yellow coloration of the eyes, face and skin, wherein the edema begins in the abdomen, the skin is thin and the patient is suffering from diarrhea.
13. That edema (shotha) is due to Kapha which is cold, fixed, itching, whitish and which on pressure pits and. does, not return to the normal level soon.
14. That again is edema (shotha) due to Kapha from which no blood flows out when incised with an instrument or a blade of sacred grass, but only slimy fluid oozes out with difficulty.
15 That is edema (shotha) due to bi-discor-dance wherin there is combination of causes and symptoms of two humors. That is an edema due to tridiscordance wherein all of the above symptoms appear owing to a combination of all the causative factors.
The incurability of Edema (shotha) in Special Seats of Affection
16. The swelling which first manifests itself in the feet and then spreads over the whole body of the person becomes formidable. So too is the edema (shotha) in women which begins from the face and spreads all over.
17. The swelling which begins in the genital organs in men or women should also be known as the most formidable condition if attended with complication.
The Complications of Edema (shotha)
18. The complications of edema (shotha) in short are vomiting, dyspnea, anorexia, thirst, fever, diarrhea and seventhly, debility.
19. When the provoked Kapha in the body gets localised at the base of the tongue, it causes immediately, an acute swelling there; and the person is affected with Upajihvika (upajihvikā), acute Glossitis.
The onset and Symptoms of Quinisi
20. When the provoked Kapha in the body gets localised at the base of the palate, it causes immediately an acute swelling there, which is called Galashundika (galaśuṇḍikā) i.e. Quinsi.
The onset and Symptoms of Deradenoncus
21. When the provoked Kapha in the body gets localised outside the throat, it produces chronic swelling there and causes Galaganda (galagaṇḍa) i.e. Deradenoncus.
The onset and Symptoms of Throat Spasm
22. When the provoked Kapha in the body becomes firmly established inside the throat, it produces immediately an acute swelling and causes Galagraha i.e. throat-spasm.
The onset and Symptoms of Acute Spreading Affection
23. When the provoked Pitta, along with the vitiated blood in the body, spreads in the skin it produces an acute red swelling and causes acute spreading affection.
The onset and Symptoms of Pimples
24. When the provoked Pitta in the body becomes localised in the skin and the blood, it causes red swelling and the person is affected with pimples.
The Onset and Symptoms of Portwine Marks Etc.
25. When the provoked Pitta in the body, reaching the blood dries up, then, the person develops moles, portwine marks, Vyanga (vyaṅga) or blue-black moles.
The Onset and Symptoms of Facial Erysipelas
26. When the provoked Pitta in the body gets localised in the temples, the person is affected with an acute, serious swelling called Shankhaka (śaṅkhaka) i. e. facial Erysipelas.
The onset and Symptoms of Ear-swelling
27. When the provoked Pitta in the body gets localised at the root of the ear at the termination of a fever, the person develops an incurable swelling there leading to death.
The onset and Symptoms of Splenic Enlargement
28. When the provoked Vata in the body becomes established in the spleen and excites it, there is slow and chronic pricking pain in the left side of the body, and the spleen gets enlarged.
The onset and Symptoms of Gulma
29. When the provoked Vata in the body gets localised in the abdominal region, it causes a swelling accompanied with colicky pain and afflicts the person with Gulma.
The Onset and Symptoms of Scrotal Enlargement
30. If the provoked Vata in the body, producing swelling and pain, moves gradually and migrates from the groin i.e. inguinal region to the scrotum, the man gets enlargement of the scrotum.
The Onset and Symptoms of Abdominal Diseases
31. When the provoked Vata in a person’s body gets a hold between the skin and the flesh, it causes a swelling in the belly and the person suffers from abdominal affections.
The onset and Symptoms of Constipation
32. When the provoked Vata in the body becomes established in the region of a person’s belly and moves neither upwards nor downwards, then he is afflicted with constipation.
The Fleshy and Malignant Tumors etc. Included in the Group of Swellings
33.Fleshy, malignant and other tumors, though quite different in name and in their symptoms, should be included in the group of swellings, owing to their having the common feature of swelling.
The onset of Diphtheria
34-35. When all the three humors Vata, Pitta and Kapha are excessively increased and provoked simultaneously in the body and get localised at the base of the tongue, they scorch locally and cause extensive swelling and pain of various kinds. This acutely spreading disease is called Rohini, i. e. Diphtheria.
The Duration of Diphtheria
36. Three nights and days are the longest period that the patient can survive; but if treated soon by an expert, he may be restored to health.
Formidable Disorders
37. There are many such diseases which though acute and severe, are yet curable. They may kill the patient if they are either not treated at all or wrongfully treated.
Easily Curable ones
38. There are other diseases which are considered mild and curable. In these diseases thorough or even slight treatment certainly accomplishes cure.
The Palliable ones
39. There are other incurable diseases which are called palliable. The best treatment given in such cases may help the patient to pull on with his existence.
Incurable Disorders
40. But there are other diseases where no treatment succeeds, even if the inexperienced physician tries to cure them; and the wise and experienced physician will not undertake to treat them.
The Classifications of disease as Curable Etc.
41. Diseases are said to be of two kinds—curable and incurable; and classified according to mildness and severity they are of four kinds.
Broad Classification
42. When classified according to cause, pain, color, site, form and nomenclature, the number of these diseases becomes really countless.
43. Just as a broad classification has been given in the brief description in the chapter on “The eight kinds of Abdominal Disorders” with a view to systematise them for purposes of treatment, even so, the common characteristics of the morbid humors in disorders will now be described.
No Standard Nomenclature of Diseases
44. A physician should never be ashamed if he is not able to name a disease, as there can be no definite standardization of the nomenclature of all diseases.
Need to diagnose Normal and Morbid Humors
45. The same provoked humor, according to the diversity of causes and its localisation in different regions, produces many varieties.
46. Therefore, treatment should be initiated after diagnosing the nature of the disease, the different regions of localization and the special causative factors
47. The physician, who after ascertaining all these three things, begins treatment intelligently and systematically, will not err in therapeutic procedure.
48. Vata, Pitta and Kapha, reside either in their normal or pathological state in the bodies of all embodied creatures. Hence, the learned physician should desire to recognise them.
The Actions of Normal Vata, Pitta and Kapha
49. The actions of the normal Vata are animation, inspiration and expiration, respiratory movement, body-movement, regular circulation of body-elements and regular elimination of excretions.
50. The actions of the normal Pitta are the causing of vision, digestive fire, body-heat, hunger, thirst, softness of body, lustre, clearness of mind and intelligence.
51. The actions of the normal Kapha are: causing viscousness, cohesion, firmness, heaviness, potency, strength, forgiveness, fortitude and greedlessness.
52. Now the signs of the decrease of Vata, Pitta and Kapha are described to be decrease of their respective actions. There may be the loss of their normal functions or even the increase of contrary ones.
Symptoms of the increase of Humors
53. Increase of their natural actions is the condition indicated in the increase of humors. The norm, the decrease and increase of humors are thus diagnosed.
Summary
Here are the recapitulatory verses:—
54-56. The number, causes, and signs and symptoms of edema (shotha), its curability or otherwise, the regional swellings and their respective precedent pathological conditions; modes of classification of diseases, brief description of the three essential factors of diagnosis, normal actions of humors, and symptoms produced in conditions of their decrease and increase:—all these, are described in the chapter entitled “The three kinds of Edema”, by Punarvasu who is free from all infatuation, ignorance, passion, greed, pride, vanity and attachment.
18. Thus, in the Section on General Principles in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the eighteenth chapter entitled “The three kinds of Edema (Shotha—śotha)”, is completed.

4. Thus has been the whole subject described according to the order of numeration.
All Diseases Are Referable to Vata, Pitta and Kapha
5-(1). All endogenous diseases manifest the discordance of Vata, Pitta and Kapha. Just as a bird, though it fly throughout the day, cannot yet overtake its own shadow, similarly, all the disorders born of the vitiation of humors, cannot escape falling into the categories of Vata, Pitta and Kapha.
5. Again, after investigating carefully the characteristics of the seat of affection, symptoms and causes of these conditions produced by morbidity of Vata, Pitta and Kapha, the learned physician classifies all diseases caused by them, in accordance with all these factors.
Here are two verses again—
6. There are many classes of disorders affecting the body, that are caused by the discordance of body-elements; but they are none of them independent of the three factors Pitta, Kapha and Vata; only the disorders produced by the exogenous causes are different.
Inter-Relation Between Endogenous and Exogenous Diseases
7. Exogenous affections may occur consequent upon endogenous disorders and similarly, increased endogenous morbidity may combine with exogenous affections. Under such circumstances, the physician should carefully investigate the primary causes and secondary complications before he begins the treatment.
Summary
Here are the two recapitulatory verses—
3-9. The scores, the monads[?], the three triads, the eight dyads, the ten tetrads, the twelve pentads, the four octads, the two hexads, and the three heptads of the classes of diseases are described in this chapter on “The Eight abdominal affections.”
19. Thus, in the section on General Principles in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the nineteenth chapter entitled, “The Eight Abdominal affections” is completed.
The Four Classes of Diseases and their Common Factor
3-(1). There are four classes of diseases, viz., the one caused by (1) exogenous factors, the other three by (2) Vata, (3) Pitta and (5) Kapha. These four groups of diseases come under one heading viz., ‘ailments’, their common feature.
Their Twofold Nature and Resorts
3 (2). They are again of twofold nature when classified as exogenous and endogenous. Their resorts again are two—mind and body.
Their innumerability
3. Their variety is innumerable owing to the countlessness of the combinations and permutations of their nature, site, symptoms and causative factors.
The Cause of Exogenous and Endogenous Diseases
4. The causes of exogenous diseases are: injury caused by finger nail, bite, fall, black-magic, curse, possession of evil spirits, blow, piercing, binding, ligaturing, compression by cord, fire, weapon, lightning, seizure and similar other factors; and the causes of endogenous diseases are the discordance of Vata, Pitta and Kapha.
Their Predisposing Factor
5. The predisposing causes of the exogenous and the endogenous diseases are unwholesome interaction between the senses and the sense-organs, volitional transgression and the effects of time.
6. All these four groups of diseases when fully developed follow one another, and though they get mixed up with one another, they do not lead to a confusion as regards their respective diagnosis..
The Difference Between the Endogenous and the Exogenous Types.
7-(1). The exogenous one begins with pain and later on leads to the discordance of Vata, Pitta, and Kapha.
7. But in the endogenous one the discordance of Vata, Pitta and Kapha occurs first, giving rise to pain later on.
The Seats of the Humors
8-(1). The primary seats of these three humors in the body will now be described.
8-(2). The bladder, rectum, hips, thighs, feet, bones and colon are the seats of Vata, and of them the colon is the special seat of Vata.
8-(3). The sweat, nutrient bodyfluid, lymph, blood and stomach lower part) are the seats of Pitta and there again, the stomach (lower part) is the special seat of Pitta.
8. The chest, head, neck, joints, stomach (upper part) and adipose tissue are the seats of Kapha; there again, the chest is the special seat of Kapha.
Actions of the Normal and the Morbid Types
9-(1). Vata, Pitta and Kapha, moving in the whole body-produce good and ill effects on the entire system, according as they are normal or provoked.
9 When normal, they produce good effects, viz., plumpness, vitality complexion, cheerfulness etc. When they become discordant, they produce evil eflects which are designated as disorders
The General and the Specific Disorders
10-(1). The disorders are again of two kinds viz, general and specific. Of these the general disorders have been already described in the chapter entitled “Eight Abdominal Diseases”. We shall now expound, in this chapter, the specific disorders of each humor.
10. There are eighty specific disorders of Vata, forty specific disorders of Pitta, and twenty specific disorders of Kapha.
The Eighty Vata-Disorders
11. Of these, we shall begin with the exposition of Vata-disorders. They are 1. distrophy of nails, 2. dermatophytosis, 3. pedialgia, 4. flat-foot, 5. paralysis of foot, 6. club-foot, 7. stiffankle, 8. cramps in the calf muscles, 9. sciatica, 10. genu varum (bowleg). 11. genu valgum (knock knee), 12. spasticity of thigh, 13. atrophy of thigh, 14. paraplegia, 15. prolapse of rectum, 16. proctalgia, 17. cryptorchidism, 18. priapism, 19. bubonocele, 20. coxa vara, 21. sheep-dung stools, 22. misperistalsis, 23. lameness, 24. scoliosis, 25. dwarfism, 26. stiff waist, 27. stiff back, 28. pleurodynia, 29. girdle pain, 30. cardiac irregularity (heart-block), 31. tachycardia 32. emphysematous chest, 33. impairment of thoracic movement, 34 pectoralgia, 35. brachial atrophy, 36. stiffness of the neck, 37. torticollis, 38. hoarseness of voice, 39. dislocation of jaw, 40. hare-lip, 41. squint (exotropia), 42. odontoschism 43. odontoseisis (looseness of teeth), 44. aphasia, 45. lalling speech, 46. astringent taste in the mouth, 47. dryness of the mouth, 48. ageusia, 49 anosmia, 50. otalgia, 51. acousma, 52. hyperacousia, 53. deafness, 54 rigidity of eyelids, 55. retraction of eyelids, 56. amaurosis, 57. eye-ache, 58. ptosis of eye, 59. ptosis of eye-brow, 60. temporal headache, 61. frontal headache (metopodynia), 62. headache, 63 fissures in the scalp, 64. facial paralysis, 65. monoplegia, 66. polyplegia, (66a. hemiplegia), 67. chronic convulsion, 68. tonic convulsion, 69. faintness, 70. giddiness, 71 tremor, 72. pendiculation, 73. hiccup, 74. asthenia 75- hyperphasia, 76. dryness, 77. harshness, 78.. dusky-red appearance, 79. insomnia, and 80. mental restlessness.
These are the eighty described as the most common of the innumerable Vata-disorders.
The Innate Qualities, Symptoms and Actions of Vata
12-(1). In all Vata-disorders mentioned above, and in those not mentioned, the experts will make an undoubted diagnosis of Vata discordance in that particular organ by observing all or some of the innate qualities of Vata or the modified effects of the action of Vata on the body.
12-(2). 1. dryness, 2. coldness, 3. lightness, 4. clearness, 5. motion, 6. invisibility and 7. instability are the innate qualities of Vata; the following are the symptoms produced in the different organs of the body, when affected by its innate quality.
12. They are:—subluxation, dislocation, dilatation, contraction, taxation, depression, excitation, attraction, tremor, circular movement, motion, pricking pain, aching pain and movement; also coarseness, harshness, clearness, porousness, dusky-redness, astringent taste, dysgeusia, dehydration, aching pains numbness, contractions, rigidity, lameness and others. These are the effects produced in the body by the actions of Vata, The condition, accompanied with any of these signs or symptoms, should be diagnosed as a Vata-disorder.
Treatment of the Provoked Vata
13-(1). It should be treated by sweet, acid, salt, unctuous and warm medications, by measures curative of Vata such as oleation, sudation, corrective and unctuous enemata, sternutation, diet, inunction, rub, affusion and other similar measures, with due consideration to dose and time.
13-(2). Among these, a physician considers the corrective and the unctuous enemata to be the best of all remedies for Vata-disorders, as they, entering the colon from the very beginning, destroy completely the venroot of morbid Vata which is the originator of all Vata-disorders.
13. And thus, Vata, being subdued, the Vata-disorders located in the other parts of the body also become allayed, just as by the eradication of the roots of a plant, the stem, branches, sprouts, flowers, fruits, leaves etc., also perish,
The forty Disorders Due to Pitta
14. Now we shall relate the forty disorders due to Pitta. They are: 1. Heating, 2. Scorching, 3. Burning, 4. Broiling, 5. Fuming, 6. Acid eructation, 7. Misdigetion [Misdigestion?], 8. Internal heat 9. Local regional heat 10. Hyperemia, 11. Hyperidrosis, 12. Local sweating (Meridrosis), 13. Local fetor, 14. Local bursting, 15. liquescence of the blood, 16. Softening of the flesh, 17. Dermothertmia, 18. Sarcothermia, 19. Disquamation, 20. Excoriation 21.—Red wheals, 22. Red eruption, 23 Hemothermia, 24. Red circular spots, 25. Greenness, 26 yellowness, 27. Bluish black marks, 28.: Herpes, Jaundice, 30. Bitter taste.
31. Metallic taste, 32 Fetor Oris, 33 polydypsia, 34. Acoria, 35. Stomatitis, 36, Pharyngitis, 37. Ophthalmitis, 38. Proctitis 39. Urethritis and phallusitis, 40. Hemorrhage, 41. Faintness. 42. Greenish or yellowish coloration of ayes, urine and feces
Thus, the forty most common Pitta-disorders out of the innumerable ones have been enumerated.
15-(1). In all the above mentioned Pitta-disorders and in those not mentioned too, the experts will make an undoubted diagnosis of Pitta-discordance in a particular organ, by observing all or some of the innate qualities of Pitta or the modified effects of the action of Pitta on the body.
15-2). For example, heat, acuteness, fluidity, slight unctuousness, color other than white and red, fleshy smell, pungent and acid taste and mobility are the innate qualities of Pitta
15-(3). And these being its innate qualities, the following symptoms are produced in the different organs of the body, when affected by Pitta.
The innate Qualities, Symptoms and Actions of Pitta
15. Burning, heat, suppuration, perspiration, softening, sloughing, itching, discharge, redness, and the emanation of smell, color and taste according to The innate nature of Pitta—these are the effects produced on the body by the action of Pitta. Conditions accompanied with any of these symptoms should be diagnosed as Pitta-disorders.
Treatment of the Provoked Pitta
16-(1). It should be treated by sweet bitter, astringent and cooling remedies and by oleation, purgation, application, affusion, inunction and other similar measures curative of Pitta, with due regard to dosage and time.
16-(2). Among all these, the physicians consider purgation to be the best of all remedies in Pitta, as entering the stomach from'the beginning, it destroys the very root of morbid Pitta which is the originator of all Pitta-disorders.
16. The Pitta being subdued, the Pitta-disorders localized in the other parts of the body, get allayed, just as by merely removing the fire, the whole of the hot-house cools down.
The Twenty Disorders Due to Kapha
17. Now we shall relate the twenty disorders of Kapha:—
1. Inappetence, 2. Torpor 3. Hypersomnia 4. Stiffness, 5. Heaviness of limbs, 6. Indolence, 7. Sweet taste in the mouth, 8. Salivation 9. Mucous expectoration, 10. Hyper-excrteion, 11. Loss of strength, 12. Loss of digestion, 14. Increased secretion in the throat, 15. Dilatation of vessels, 16. Deradenoncus, 17. Excessive corpulence (orchidoptosis), 18. Subnormal temperature, 19. Urticaria, 20. Pallor, and 21. Whitish tinge of the urine, eye and feces.
Thus have been enumerated the twenty most common Kapha-disorders out of the innumerable disorders of Kapha.
The innate Qualities, Symptoms and Actions of Kapha
18-(1). In all the above-mentioned Kapha-disorders and also in those not mentioned, the experts will make an indubitable diagnosis of kapha-discordance in that particular organ, by observing all or some of the innate qualities of Kapha or the modified effects of the action of Kapha on the body.
18 (2). Unctuosness, coldness, whiteness, heaviness, sweetness, firmness, sliminess and viscocity are the innate qualities of Kapha.
18-(3). These being its innate qualities, the following symptoms are produced in the different organs of the body when affected by Kapha.
18. Whiteness, coldness, itching, firmness, heaviness, unctuousness, numbness, humidity, excretory secretion, obstruction, sweetness, and chronicity are the effects produced in the body by the action of Kapha, the condition accompanied, with any of the above symptoms should be diagonsed as a Kapha-disorder.
Treatment of the Provoked Kapha
19-(1). It should be treated with pungent, bitter, astringent, acute, hot and dry remedies, and by sudation, errhines, exercise, and other similar measures curative of Kapha, with due consideration to dose and time.
19-(2). Amongst these the physicians consider emesis to be the best remedey in all Kapha-disorders, as emesis, acting on the stomach from the beginning, destroys the very root of morbid Kapha which is the originator of all Kapha-disorders.
19. This morbid Kapha being subjugated, the Kapha-disorders localised in the other parts of the body also become allayed, just as by breaking open the dam of a field, rice, barley, and other crops dry up by being deprived of water.
The Importance of Pathology, therapeutics and Posology in the Science of Treatment
20. Here are verses again:—
The physician should first diagnose the disease and then should decide on the line of treatmert; and begin the treatment in the light of his observations.
21.If the physician begins the treatment without diagnosing the disease, even though he may be the best therapeutist his success depends purely on chance.
22. But he who knows the differential diagnosis of diseases, who is skilled in all kinds of therapeutics and who is also well versed in the knowledge of clime, season and dosage, achieves success with certainty.
Summary
Here are the recapitulatory verses—
23. The brief account of the nature, seat, origin, predisposing causes and indubitability of diagnosis even in a combined state of diseases is given here.
24. The primary seats of humors, the lists of specific disorders, the different innate qualities of humors and the effects produced in the body by the action of morbid humors;
25. And also the remedies of disorders in their severality, are all fully described by the seer, in this Major chapter on Diseases.
18. Thus, in the Section on General Principles in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the twentieth chapter entitled “The Major list of Diseases (Maharoga—mahāroga)” is completed.
The Fight Censured Types of Men
3-(1). In respect of their bodily conditions, eight kinds of persons are found censurable.
3. They are: the very, tall and the very short, the very hairy and the hairless, the very dark and the very fair, the very corpulent and the very emaciated.
The Symptoms of Corpulency
4- (1). Of these again the very corpulent and the very emaciated suffer from specially censurable traits. Thus as regards the corpulent person, he is affected with the eight disabilities viz., diminution of life, lack of agility, difficulty in sex-act, debility, fetor, distressing sweats, excessive hunger and excessive thirst.
4-(2). Such excessive corpulence is caused by over eating, by the use of articles that are heavy, sweet, cold and unctuous, by lack of exercise and of sex-act, by day-sleep and continual cheerfulness, by lack of mental exertion and by inherited tendency.
4-(3). In the very corpulent, it is the fat alone that keeps increasing and not the other body-elements. Consequently, there is shortening of the life-span. 0 wing to the flabbiness, tenderness and heaviness of the fat, the corpulent man gets hampered in his movement. Owing to the paucity of semen and the obstruction of genital passages by fat, the performance of the sex-act becomes difficult. Owing to the disturbance of the body-elements, debility, results. From the presence of the morbid fat, as also from the innate quality, of the fat element and from excessive sweating, there results fetor of the body. On account of the admixture of fat with Kapha and its fluidity, excess and heaviness, and also of the inability to bear the strain of exercise, there occurs the distress of excessive sweating. On account of the acute gastric fire and the excess of Vata in the alimentary tract, there occur excessive hunger and thirst.
Here are verses again:—
5-6. In consequence of the passages, being obstructed by fat the Vata, moving mainly in the stomach, whips up the gastric fire and absorbs the food. The corpulent man digests his meals speedily and craves for food inordinately. By violating, the rule concerning the meal-time he gets dreadful diseases.
7. These two, the gastric fire and the Vata, are the special workers of havoc. They burn up the corpulent man, as the forest fire burns up the forest.
8. The fat element in the body having increased inordinately, the Vata and other humors, breaking out into sudden and fierce disorders, rapidly destroy their victim’s life.
The Symptoms of Corpulency
That man is spoken of as over-corpulent who on account of the inordinate increase of fat and flesh is disfigured by pendulous buttocks, belly and breasts and whose increased bulk is not matched by a corresponding increase in energy Thus, the evils of corpulency together with its causes and symptoms have been set out.
The Causes of Emaciation
10.Now we shall say what has to be said concerning the very emaciated.
11-12 Indulgence in non-unctuous drinks, starvation, under eating, overwork, grief, suppression of the urges of nature and of sleep, dry massage, repeated baths, constitutional tendency, old. age, the sequela of disease, and Wrathful disposition renders a man extremely emaciated.
The Evils of Emaciation
13. The emaciated man cannot stand strain of exercise or of a full-meal or of hunger and thirst, or of disease, or of strong medication. Similarly, he cannot bear great cold or heat or the strain of the sex act.
14. Splenic disorders, cough, wasting, dyspnea, Gulma, piles, abdominal affections and disorders of assimilation generally assail the emaciated man.
The Symptoms of Emaciation
15. That man is said to be overemaciated who is lean of buttocks belly and neck, who is covered with a network of prominent vessels, who is reduced to skin and bones and who has prominent joints.
Treatment of Both the Conditions
16. These two, the very corpulent and the very emaciated, are perpetually afflicted with diseases and are to be treated with constant slimming and nourishing remedies respectively.
Emaciation the Lesser Evil of the Two
17. Of the two conditions, emaciation is the lesser evil, though both alike require to be remedied. When both are overcome by disease, it is the corpulent that suffer more.
The Proportionately Built Frame, the Best
18. The man who is well proportioned in flesh, well-knit in figure, and firm of senses, is not overpowered by the violence of disease.
19. He that is able to endure hunger and thirst, heat and cold and the strain of exercise, and has normal digestive and assimilative powers, is regarded as being properly proportioned in body.
20. For reducing the corpulent, heavy but non-nourishing food should be given; while for building up the emaciated, light but nourishing food should be given.
Treatment of Corpulency and of Emaciation
21-23. Eats and drinks that are alleviative of Vata, Kapha and fat; non-unctuous, warm and strong enemata; dry massage, course of guduch and cultivated nut-grass or of the myrobalans or of butter-milk wine or of honey or of embelia, dry ginger, barley-alkali, iron powder, honey, the powder of barley aud emblic myrobalans—the systematic use of these is considered excellent.
24. The course of pentaradices of the bael group mixed with honey, or the course of mineral pitch mixed with the decoction of windkiller is also considered beneficial.
25-27. Prashatika (praśātikā), Italian millet sanwa millet, wild barley, barley, great millet, common millet, green gram horse-gram, Cakramudgaka, the seed of pigeon-pea mixed with wild snake-gourd and emblic myrobalan should be used as food followed by hydromel as drink. Such wines as are eliminative of fat, flesh and Kapha should be prescribed as post-prandial drinks in proper dose, for the cure of excessive corpulency.
28. One desirous of getting rid of corpulency must indulge, in a gradually increasing measure, in nightwaking, sex-act, exercise and mental exertion.
29-33. Sleep, cheerfulness, soft beds, peace and tranquility of mind; lack of worry, sex-act and exercise; pleasant sights, fresh foods and fresh wines; juices of domestic, wetland and aquatic creatures and well prepared meats, curds, ghee and milk; the various kinds of sugarcane, shali rice, black-gram, wheat aud the products of gur; nutrient enemata of sweet and unctuous articles, daily inunction of the body; oil-massage; bath and the use of sandal paste and flower garlands;wearing of white raiment; the seasonal purification of the morbid humors; the systematic use of the restorative and virilific preparations:—these, can cure even extreme conditions of emaciation aud confer the measure of plumpness on men.
Roborant Factors in Brief
34. By not taking thought over things, by taking plenty of nourishing victuals and by indulging in sleep, a man surely grows fat like a boar.
The Causes of Sleep
35. When the mind and the senses, getting tired, retire from their sense-objects, then does the man fall into sleep.
The Effects of Sleep
36.Happiness and sorrow, growth and wasting, strength and weakness, virility and impotence, knowledge and ignorance, as well as life and its cessation depend on sleep.
The Evils of Excessive and Untimely indulgence in Sleep
37. Sleep, indulged in either out of time or over-much or not at all, swallows up life and happiness like unto an other Night of Destruction.
For Whom Day-Sleep Is Beneficial
38. That very sleep, when indulged in rightly, makes a man’s life happy and long even as the knowledge of truth, as it dawns, brings wondrous powers to the yogi.
39. Those who are wearied by the strain of singing, study, drink, society of women, toil, bearing heavy burdens or by way-faring, those who are dyspeptic, those who suffer from wounds or ulcers, those who are emaciated, those who are aged, tender of age, or weak, those who suffer from thirst, diarrhea, colic, dyspnea and hiccup, those who are wasted of body, those who have had a fall or who are injured and insane, those who are fatigued by travel and long vigils, those who are worn out by anger, grief and fear, and those who ere habituated to day-sleep should take to sleeping in the day in all seasons alike.
42. Thus, they will secure the concord of the body-elements and also strength. The Kapha which by these measures is nourished will nourish their limbs and stabilize their life-span.
43. As the Vata is increased by the dryness caused by the sun’s heat in summer, and as the nights are very short, day-sleep is commended in the summer.
Interdicton Against Day-Sleep Except in Summer
44 In seasons other than the summer, day-sleep provokes the Kapha and the Pitta. Day-sleep is therefore not commended then.
45. Corpulent people, those that are habituated to unctuous articles, phlegmatics, those afflicted with Kapha-disorders and those that suffer from chronic poisoning should, under, no circumstances, sleep during the day.
The Evils of indulgence in the Unwholesome Type of Day-Sleep
46-49- Jaundice, head-ache, stiffness, heaviness of limbs, body-ache, loss of gastric fire, excessive mucus-secretion in stomach, edema, anorexia, nausea, rhinitis, hemicrania, wheals, dandruff, pimples, pruritus, torpor, cough, diseases of the throat, delusion of memory and intellect, occlusion of body-channels, fever, asthenia of senses and the circulation of poison result from unwholesome sleep in the day. The wise man, therefore, discriminating between the wholesome and the unwholesome sleep, should resort to that sleep only which leads to happiness.
The Effects of Night-Waking & Day Sleep in a Sitting Posture
50. Keeping, awake in the night diminishes the viscocity of the body-fluids, while sleeping in the day increases it. But sleeping lightly in a sitting posture does not induce either of these conditions.
Corpulence and Emaciation Dependent on Sleep and Food
51. From the point of view of personal hygiene, the body is known to depend on sleep as much as on food for its happiness. Especially do corpulency and emaciation depend on conditions of food and sleep
Treatment of insomnia
52-54. Inunction of the body, oil-massage, bath; meat juices of domestic, wet-land and aquatic animals; shali rice with curds; milk, unctuous articles, wine, cheerfulness of mind, congenial perfumes and sound and shampoos; soothing applications for the eye head and face; the use of comfortable beds and apartments, and the approach of the usual time bring quickly to one the sleep that was lost for some reason or other.
Treatment of Hypersomnia
55-56. The use of purgatives, errhines, and emetics; fear, worry, wrath, smoking, exercise and depletion of blood; fasting and uncomfortable beds; abundance of satvic quality of the mind and the subjugation of the tamasic quality—these, avert the unwholesome sleep that has well nigh come upon one.
Causes of insomnia
57 The following, too, are to be known as dispellers of sleep: absorption in work, old age, disease, habitus and aggravated Vata.
Varieties of Sleep
58. There is a sleep born of tamas and a sleep born of Kapha; there is a sleep born of the weariness of mind and body; there is a sleep which forebodes diseases; there is also a sleep which comes in the wake of disease. There is, finally, the sleep which is born of the very nature of the night.
59. Sleep that is known to be born of the nature of the night is called by the experts “The Omnibenevolent Mother-sleep—the nourisher of creatures”. Sleep which is born of the quality of tamas, they call, the Root of Evil. The remaining are included in disease conditions.
Summary
Here are the recapitulatory verses—
60. The censured persons (nindita purusha) and among them the specially censured twain, the etiology, pathology and treatment of these censured conditions;
61. For whom sleep is wholesome and when; for whom sleep is not wholesome and when; the remedy for persons suffering from hysersomnia [hypersomnia?] and insomnia; and whence sleep is born;
62. Which sleep is of what nature and productive of what effects—all these, Punarvsu, the son of Atri, has expounded in this chapter entitled “The Eight Censured Persons”.
21. Thus, in the Section on General Principles in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the twenty first chapter entitled, “The Eight Censured Persons (Nindita Purusha—nindita-puruṣa)” is completed.
Lightening, Roborant and other Therapies are the Six Treatments
3.Addressing himself to the six choicest of his disciples headed by Agnivesha, who were dedicated to study and meditation, the Master, Atreya, declared thus, with a view to stimulate inquiry,
4.“He indeed is the physician who knows the timely administration of the lightening (langhana) and the roborant (brimhana) therapies, the desiccation and oleation therapies, and the sudation and astringent therapies.”
Agnivesa’s Queries Regarding Them
5.Atreya having thus spoken, Agnivesha said to him;
6-7. “O, thou, our worshipful preceptor! it becomes thee to tell us about the lightening therapy (langhana) and those for whom it is indicated, about the roborant therapy (brimhana) and those for whom it is indicated, about the desiccation therapy and. those for whom it is indicated, about the various methods of oleation therapy and for whom they are indicated, and about
the various methods of sudation therapy and in whom they are indicated, and about the methods of the astringent therapy and in whom they are indicated.
8. Tell us in short, the symptoms of the right, the wrong and the excessive administration of these therapies viz., the lightening and other therapies”
The Nature of the Lightening therapy (langhana)
9. Hearing these words of Agnivesa, the Master said, “That which causes lightness of the body is known as the lightening therapy (langhana).”
The Nature of the Desiccant and the Roborant therapies (brimhana)
10. The treatment which increases the size of the body and makes it robust is called the roborant therapy (brimhana), and that which produces dryness, roughness and clearness is called the desiccant therapy
The Nature of the Oleation and the Sudation therapies
11. That, which increases viscosity, fluidity, softness and moistness in the body is known as the oleation therapy. That, which causes ptrspi ration and destroys stiffness, heaviness and cold is known as the sudation therapy.
The Nature of the Astringent Therapy
12-12½. That treatment, which astringes what is flowing aud stabilises what is unstable is called the astringent therapy. That substance is considered lightening which is mainly light, hot, acute, clear, dry. subtle rough, flowing and hard.
13-13½. That substance is considered roborant which is mainly heavy, cooling, soft, unctuous, thick, gross slimy, sluggish, stable and smooth
14-14½. That substance is considered desiccant which is mainly non-unctuous, light, rough acute, hot stable, limpid and hard.
15. That substance is considered unctuous, which is mainly fluid, subtle flowing, viscid, slimy, heavy cooling sluggish and soft.
16. That substance is considered sudorific, which is mainly hot, acute flowing, viscid, dry. subtle fluid, stable aud heavy.
17. That substance is considered astringent which is mainly cooling, sluggish, soft, smooth dry, subtle, fluid, stable and light.
18. The four modes of purification (i.e. the quinary purificatory procedures with the exception of the unctuous enema), subjection to thirst, exposure to wind and sun, the use of digestives and recourse to fasting and exercise, constitute the ten methods of the lightening therapy.
Various Methods of Lightening
19. Those that suffer from an excess of Kapha, Pitta, blood or waste products, and are but slightly affected with Vata, and who are huge bodied and strong should be lightened by means of the purificatory? procedures.
20. The wise physician should generally treat with digestives, in the beginning, those who suffer from diseases of moderate intensity due to Kapha and Pitta, such as vomiting, diarrhea, heart-disease, acute intestinal irritation, intestinal torpor, fever, obstipation, heaviness, eructation, nausea, anorexia and similar conditions.
22 In cases where the above mentioned diseases occur in a mild intensity, their alleviation may be brought about by a recourse to abstention from food and drink.
23. The diseases in strong persons marked with moderate intensity may be subdued by a recourse to exercise and exposure to sun and air. What need, then, is their to say that these diseases, when they are only of a mild intensity can be subdued in the same manner!
24 Those who suffer from skin diseases, urinary anomalies, and who are bulky with excess of unctuous and fluid matter in the body and also those who suffer from disorders of Vata, should be administered the lightening therapy (langhana) in winter.
Meat as Roborant
25. That flesh is regarded as roborant which is not polluted by poisoned weapons, which is not diseased and which is obtained from those animals, fish and birds, that are in the prime of life and are found roaming at will in their natural haunts.
Persons in Whom the Roborant therapy Is indicated; and the Roborant Articles
26.For persons that are wasted of body, consumptive, emaciated, aged, weak, given to constant way faring, and addicted to wine and women, the roborant therapy (brimhana) is indicated in summer.
27. The light meat-juice of carnivorous creatures is a roborant to persons that have been emaciated by the diseases of consumption, piles and assimilation disorders.
Persons in Whom the Desiccant therapy Is indicated; and the Desiccant Articles
28. Bath, oil-massage, sleep, and unctuous enemata medicated with drugs of the sweet group, milk and ghee: these are roborant in effect to all persons.
29. The habitual use of articles of pungent, bitter and astringent tastes, over-indulgence in women, the use of oil-cakes of rape seed and til, buttermilk, honey and similar things tend to induce dryness.
30. The desiccant therapy is indicated in diseases marked by excessive discharge and great morbidity of humors, in diseases of the vital parts, spastic paraplegia and in similar conditions.
31. As regards the questions of what constitute the oleous substances, who are the fit subjects for oleation, what are the various kinds of sudation and who are to be administered sudation—these, have been elaborately explained by me in the chapters on oleation and sudation procedures.
Astringents
32. All things that are fluid, thin, consistent, refrigerant, sweet, bitter and astringent act as astringents.
33. The astringent therapy is indicated in those who are scorched by Pitta, caustics and heat, those who are afflicted with vomiting and diarrhea and those suffering from complications of poison and over-sudation.
Successful and the Overdone Lightening therapy (langhana)
34-35. The lightening therapy (langhana) is to be regarded successful when the normal elimination of flatus, urine and feces is restored; the body feels light; the stomach, eructations, throat and mouth become clear; torpor and exhaustion disappear and perspiration and taste reappear; acute hunger and thirst return and the mind recovers its sense of ease.
36-37. Pain in the joints, bodyaches, cough, parching of the mouth, complete loss of hunger, anorexia, thirst, weakness of hearing and slight confusion of mind, frequent eructations, fainting, loss of body-temperature and strength:—these, are the consequents of overdone lightening therapy.
Successful and Overdone Roborant therapy
38-38½. Accession of strength and robustness and freedom from the evils of emaciation are the signs of. successful roboraat therapy. Corpulency is the sign of roborant therapy (brimhana) overdone. The signs of the desiccant, therapy well-done or overdone, are:—the same as those of the lightening therapy similarly performed.
Signs of astringent therapy
39-40. When the disorders in which the astringent therapy is indicated have been subjugated and the patient has regained his strength, the administration of the therapy should be considered successful. Duskiness, stiffness of limbs, eructation, stiffness of jaw, catch in the cardiac region and the suppression of the urges of nature are the signs of overdone astringent therapy.
The Conclusion of the Six therapies
41-42. The common sign of all these six therapies when ill-performed is not merely the non-alleviation, but the actual aggravation of the diseases for which they are prescribed as remedies. Thus, the six most useful therapies covering all diseases have been described. If administered with due consideration to time and dosage they are sure to accomplish the cure of all curable disorders.
The Comprehensive Nature of These Six Therapies
Here is a verse again—
43. As there are manifold combinations of ailments, there are also many combinations of therapies to suit them; but even as the morbid humors of the body do not transcend the triad of Vata etc., so the therapies too do not transcend the haxad [hexad?] described above.
Summary
Here is the recapitulatory verse—
44. Thus, in this chaptar entitled “Lightening Therapy (langhana)”, all the six therapies which comprise the entire field of therapeutics have been expounded by the worshipful one, in accordance with the questions put.
22. Thus, in the section on General Principles in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the twenty-second chapter entitled “The Lightening (Langhana—laṅghana) and Roborant (Brimhana—bṛṃhaṇa) Therapies” is completed.
The Need for the Impletion therapy; the Disorders Due to indulgence in Impletion
3-7. He that impletes himself in excess with unctuous, sweet, heavy and viscous substances, with fresh foods and wines, with the flesh of wetland and acquatic [aquatic?] animals, with cow’s milk aud its products, the products of gur and with articles prepared of flour, or he that dislikes movement and is given to daysleeping, to over-indulgence in lounging and lying in soft beds gets afflicted with the following diseases arising from excessive impletion, unless he is promptly treated with counter measures: anomalies of the urinary secretion, pimples, wheals, pruritus, anemia, fevers, dermatosis, chyme-disorders, dysuria, anorexia, torpor, impotency, obesity, indolence, excessive secretion in the channels of the sensory organs, delusion of intellect, sleepiness, edema and other similar disorders.
Their Treatment.
8-9. In such cases emesis, purgation, depletion of blood, exercise, fasting, smoking and sudation are beneficial, and likewise the use of the chebulic myrobalan with honey, a dietary consisting mostly of dry foods, and the use of powders and applications that are described as curative of pruritus and wheals are beneficial.
10. The decoction prepared by boiling, in water, the three myrobalans, purging cassia, Patha and dita bark, along with kurchi, nutgrass, emetic nut and neem is to be taken as potion.
11. By taking a regular course of it at the proper time and in the proper dose, urinary anaolies[?] and other disorders born of excessive impletion will certainly be eliminated.
12-13. Nut-grass, purging cassia, Patha, the three myrobolans, deodar, small caltrops, catechu, neem, turmeric:—drinking the infusion of these drugs every morning according to the nature of the morbid condition, one gets completely relieved of all disorders arising from excessive impletion.
14. Skin lesions are cured by dry massage, friction massage, and bath medicated with the unctuous preperations made from the same drugs.
The Disorders Due to Depletion
15-16. Costus, onyx, asafoetida, the bones of demoiselle crane bird, the three spices, sweet flag, kurchi, cardamom, small caltrops, celery seeds, Indian rockfoil:—these if taken mixed with buttermilk or whey or with the acid juice of small jujube will cure dysuria and anomalies of urinary secretion.
17. The anomalies of urinary secretion and other similar diseases are also cured by the systematic course of buttermilk and chebulic myrobalans or of the three myrobalans or of the medicated wines.
18. The demulcent drink prepared from the three spices, the three myrobalans, honey, embelia, celery seeds, roasted corn flour and oil and soaked in eagle-wood-water is beneficial.
19-21. The three spices, embelia, drumstick, the three myrobalans, kurroa, yellow-berried and Indian night shades, turmeric and Indian berberry, Patha, atees, ticktrefoil, asafoetida, the roots of Kebuka, bishop’s weed, coriander, white-flowered leadwort, sanchal salt, cumin and juniper: these are to be taken in equal parts and powdered. This powder should be mixed with equal quantities of ghee, oil and honey; and the whole mixed again with sixteen times its quantity of roasted corn flour; preparing a demulcent drink of this, it should be taken as potion for relief of over impletion.
22-24. Diseases born of excessive impletion, urinary disorders, claudication of Vata, dermatosis, pimples, jaundice, splenic disorders anemia, edema, dysuria, anorexia, cardiac disorders, consumption, cough, dyspnea, throat-spasm, helminthiasis, assimilation disorders, leucoderma and excessive corpulence:—all these diseases are cured by the administration of the above-mentioned beverage. It enkindles the digestive fire in man and enhances his memory and intelligence.
25-25½. One given to daily exercise or eating only after the previous meal has been digested, or one who eats barley and wheat, is freed from excessive corpulence and gets cured of the diseases arising from excessive impletion. The disease arising from excessive impletion and the depletive remedies for them have thus been described.
Their Treatment
26 30. Hereafter we shall describe the diseases arising from depletion along with their remedies. The diminution of the body-heat, strength, complexion, vital essence, semen and flesh; fever attended with cough, pleurodynia, anorexia, weakness of hearing, insanity, delirium, cardiac pain, suppression of urine and feces, aches in the calf, thigh and waist, breaking pains in knuckles, bones and joints and other diseases born of Vata and diseases, due to disorders of upward movement of Vata:—all these ailments are born of the excess of depletion. Impletion is stated to be the treatment of this condition, by specialists. It may act immediately or act after a long course of treatment.
Treatment in Sadden Emaciation and in Chronic Debility
31. It is only those that have rapidly lost weight that can as rapidly be restored by impletive measures. Cases of long-standing emaciation cannot thus be rehabilitated except by continued administration of the impletion-therapy (santarpana).
32. The person that has long been weak must be administered the treatment unhurriedly, with due consideration to the state of the body, the digestive fire, the morbidity of humors, the drug, the proper dosage and time,
33. For such a person meat-juices, the various kinds of milk and ghee, the different kinds of bath and enemata, inunctions and impletive demulcent beverages are beneficial.
34. We shall now describe the restoratives which are beneficial in persons afflicted with chronic fever, cough, emaciation, dysuria, excessive thirst and disorders of the upward movement of Vata.
35. Roasted corn flour of double the measure of the total quantity of sugar, long pepper, oil, ghee and honey, taken in equal parts, is virilific. A demulcent beverage made of these is highly recommended.
36 Roasted coin flour, wine, honey and sugar make a nourishing beverage. This should be taken for inducing and regulating the downward course of flatus, urine, Kapha and Pitta.
37 Treacle, roasted corn flour, ghee, whey and sour conjee combined to form a nourishing drink, should be taken for the alleviation of dysuria and the disorders of misperistalsis.
38. Demulcent drink prepared from dates, grapes, kokum butter, fruits of tamarind, pomegranates, sweet-falsah aud emblic myrobalan is curative of disorders due to alcoholism.
Some Impletive Recipes
39. Demulcent drink prepared from sweet or sour articles and water, whether with or without unctuous substance, is an immediate impletive, promoting firmness, complexion and strength of the body.
Summary
Here is the recapitulatory verse:—
40. The diseases born of excessive impletion and those born of depletion along with their remedies have been described in the chapter entitled “Impletion Therapy.”
23. Thus, in the section on General Principles in the treatise compiled by Agnivesa and revised by Caraka, the twenty third chapter entitled. “Impletion Therapy (Santarpana—santarpaṇa)” is completed.
The Blood Derived From A Regimen Is Pure
3. That blood (shonita) in the body is pure, which is derived from the observance of the systematic regimen that has been already described with reference to homologation, elime, season and habituation.
The Advantages of the Pure Blood
4. The pure blood (Vishuddha—viśuddha) so derived invests the person with strength, complexion, happiness and long life. Verily, life is upheld by blood (Shonita—śoṇita).
The Etiology of Blood Vitiation
5-10. The blood (shonita) gets vitiated by the following factors—The use of vitiated, very acute and hot wines or similar intoxicants, ths excessive use of salts and alkalis, acid and pungent articles, the use of horse-gram, black gram, lablab, til and til oil; or common yam, garden radish etc., and all varieties of greens; the use of the flesh of aquatic, wetland, terricolous and “tearer group” of animals, the use of curds, sour conjee, whey, vinegar and Sura and Sauviraka wines, the use of such articles as are incompatible or have gone soft or are foul smelling; sleeping in the day having eaten liquid, unctuous and heavy foods; indulgence in over-eating and anger, exposure to heat of the sun and the fire, suppressing the urge for vomiting, and not practising depletion of blood at the proper season; fatigue, injury, grief, predigestion-meal, eating on loaded stomach and the natural tendency of the autumnal season.
The Blood-Born Diseases
11-16. As a result, various kinds of blood-born diseases occur:—sores in the mouth, injected condition of the eyes, stink-nose, halitosis, Gulma, mouth disease, acute spreading affections, hemothermia, sleepiness, abscess, hematuria, menorrhagia, rheumatic condition, discoloration, asthenia of the digestive fire, excessive thirst, heaviness of limbs, burning, prostration, anorexia, headache, misdigestion of food and drink, bitter and acid eructations, exhaustion, excessive irritability, delusion of understanding, saline taste in the mouth, excessive perspiration, fetor of the body, intoxication, tremors, aphonia, torpor, hypersomnia, frequent attacks of faintness, pruritus, boils, wheals, pimples, dermatosis, rashes and similar disorders: all theses diseases are to be known as dependent on the condition of the blood.
17. Further, all such curable diseases as do not get cured, though treated by appropriate measures of refrigeration, heating, inunction, desiccation etc. are to be regarded as blood-born diseases.
The Treatment in Blood-diseases.
18. In such diseases born of vitiated blood, the treatment should consist of measures used for the alleviation of hemothermia, as also purgation, fasting and blood letting.
19. A patient must be bled according to his strength and the degree of the morbidity of his humors, the required degree of purity of the blood and the seat of affection.
20-21. When the blood is vitiated by Vata, it becomes dusky-red, clear, frothy and thin. If vitiated by Pitta, it becomes dark-yellow, and on account of the increased heat, it takes a long time to coagulate. If the blood is vitiated by Kapha, it becomes slightly pale, slimy, fibrillated and solid If affected by two of the humors, the blood evinces a syndrome characteristic of those two humors. When all the three humors combine to vitiate, there is a total concurrence of all the symptoms.
22. When the blood is of the color of heated gold or that of the insect called “Indragopa” (Trombidum), or like the red lotus or like the Alaktaka juice (lac dye) or like jequirity seed, then that blood is to be regarded as pure (visuddha viddhi shonita).
Regimen of diet after Blood-letting.
23. When the blood has been depleted, food that is neither very hot nor very cold but is light and stimulative of digestion is indicated, Since, during this time, the blood in the body is in a restless condition the gastric fire must be very carefully protected.
The Characteristics of the Man with Pure blood
24. He, who has clear complexion and senses, who desires sense pleasures, who has the strength of the digestive fire unimpaired, and is happy, well built and strong, is said to be pure of blood (Vishuddha-rakta—viśuddharakta).
25-27. When, in a person given to unclean diet and enveloped by passion and ignorance, the provoked humors either individually or jointly moving in the channels of the blood [raktavāhin] or of the nutrient fluid or of sensation get obstructed and localised, as a consequence thereof, various diseases are produced. They are: intoxication, fainting and syncope. The wise physician must know that the gravity of these diseases, with respect to causes, symptoms and treatment, is greater in the order of their enumeration.
28. When the Vata finds entrance into the weakened centre of consciousness,then distracting the mind of the man, it confounds his wits.
29. Similarly the Pitta or the Kapha, having thus distracted man’s mind, induces agitation of his wits. Their shpecial characteristics will now be explained.
The Diagnosis of Intoxication due to Vata and other Factors
30. The person whose speech is indistinct, copious and fast, who makes unstable and incoordinated movements and whose appearance is dry, dusky or red should be known as suffering from intoxication of the Vata type.
31. The person whose speech is wrathful and harsh, who likes fighting and picking up quarrels and who is of red, yellow or of dark complexion is to be regarded as affected by intoxication of the Pitta type.
32-32½. The person whose speech is scanty, incoherent or irrelevant, who is lethargic and indolent and who is pale of complexion and is preoccupied must be known to suffer from intoxication of the Kapha type. All these symptoms appear together in the condition of intoxication caused by tri-discordance.
33-34. The characteristic of all intoxication is that it rises and abates quickly aud resembles the intoxication due to alcohol. The condition of intoxication which is said to proceed from alcohol as well as that resulting from poison and toxic state of the blood, do not occur except through the discordance of Vata, Pitta and Kapha.
The Symptoms of Fainting due to Vata and other factors
35-36. He whose fainting is brought about by Vata, perceives space as being blue or black or red before fainting and awakens from it quickly. He suffers from bodily tremors, pain in the limbs and severe pain in the cardiac region, and is emaciated and of a dusky or red complexion.
37-38. He whose fainting is born of Pitta, falls into it perceiving space as red, green or yellow and awakens from his fit bathed in sweat; he gets very thirsty and has burning sensation; his eyes are red, yellow or bewildered and he has loose motions, and is yellow in complexion.
39-40. He whose fainting is born of Kapha falls into it, perceiving space as a cloud or as covered with clouds of darkness, and awakens from it after a long time and with heavy limbs as if they were wrapped in wet leather, and with excessive salivation and nausea.
41. The fainting fit, when it is due to tri-discordance, is marked with all the symptoms mentioned above manifesting in an epileptic fit; it fells its victim suddenly, without however, presenting the symptoms of fearful convulsions.
The Difference between Syncope and intoxication and Fainting
42. The disorders of intoxication and fainting subside of their own accord when the morbidity of the causative humors has spent itself out in the attack. The condition of syncope, however, does not subside without treatment.
The onset of Syncope
43. The highly provoked humors lodged in the vital parts of man, by paralysing the functions of speech, body, and mind, overthrow the debilitated victim.
44. Such a man, who, being overcome by syncope, is turned as it were into a log of wood and appears as if dead, will soon be deprived of his life unless he receives emergency treatment.
The Treatment of Syncope
45. As, in the case of a pitcher sinking rapidly down a deep well the prudent man hastens to retrieve it before it has reached the bottom, so it should be in the case of the man overcome with syncope.
46. The following are the measures prescribed for the resuscitation of the man overcome with syncope:—eye salves, nasal applications, inhalations snuffs, pricking with needles or branding or piercing beneath the nails; plucking the hair of the head or the body, biting with the teeth, or rubbing the body with the seed of cowage are helpful in awakening him.
48. Various kinds of strong wines mixed copiously with pungent articles must be frequently poured into his mouth.
49-50. Similarly, the juice of pomelo mixed with ginger, or sanchal salt mixed with wine and sour gruel with asafoetida and black pepper added must be poured into the throat until consciousness returns. When consciousness has been restored, the patient must be given light foods.
51-53. The wise physician, in order to protect the mind of the awakened patient from the evil consequences of syncope and from relapsing again into insensibility, should treat him with measures that excite wonder and awaken the memory with delightful discourses, with pleasant vocal and instrumental music, with wonderful sights, with laxatives and emetics, with various inhalations, eyepaints, gargles and blood-letting, and with exercise and friction massage of the body.
Treatment of intoxication and Fainting
54. In all conditions of fainting and intoxication, the patients who have been prepared with the oleation and sudation procedures should, according to the measure both of their vitality and of morbidity be administered the quinary purificatory procedures.
55. Further, in these conditions a course of the medicated ghee prepared with the group of the twenty eight drugs known as Kalyana ghee or of the medicated ghee called “the Bitter Shatpala [ṣaṭpala] ghee” is recommended.
56. Similarly, a course of the three myrobalans with ghee, honey and sugar, or a course of mineral pitch, or a course of milk.
57. Or a course of long pepper, or a course of white flowered lead-wort with milk, or a course of vitalizing drugs, or a course of the potted ghee of ten years’ standing is recommended
58 The diseases of intoxication and fainting get alleviated by the letting of blood as also by devotion to scriptures and to good and righteous men.
Summary
Here are the two recapitulatory verses.
59. The nature of the pure and of the impure blood, the causative factors in each case, the blood born diseases and their remedies.
60. The etiology, symptoms and treatment of intoxication, fainting and syncope: all these have been described in this chapter entitled “The Blood derived through Systematic Regimen.”
24. Thus, in the section on General Principles in the treatise complied by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the twenty fourth chapter entitled “The Blood derived through Systematic Regimen (Vidhi-shonita—vidhiśoṇita)” is completed,
6. Thus ends the tetrad of chapters deeling with therapeutic procedures.
Discussion Among Sages
3-4 Long ago among the great sages gathered about the worshipful Atreya to whom all knowledge was a matter of direct perception, there arose first the following discussion as to determining the truth concerning the primal origin of man (purusha-samjnaka) who is the aggregate of the spirit, senses, mind and sense-objects, as also concerning the diseases affecting him.
5. On this occasion, king Vamaka of Kashi, who was learned in the sciences, having approached the assembly of the sages and having duly saluted them, made this observation.
6. “What, O, sirs! is the truth? Do the diseases afflicting man arise from the same source as he himself is derived from or is it otherwise?” When the king had thus spoken Punarvasu, addressing the sages said—
7. “You who have had all your doubts dispelled by your immeasurable in sight into knowledge and science, it behoves you, now, to resolve the doubt raised by the king of Kasi.
8. Parikshi Maudgalya, having considered the question, was the first to formulate the answer. He said: “Man is born of the spirit likewise all the diseases are born of the spirit. For the spirit is the source of every thing.
9. It is the spirit that acquires and enjoys the merits of action and their fruits respectively; for in the absence of the element of consciousness there is no activity either pleasurable or painful”.
10 But the sage Saraloma, said “No, this is not so; for surely the spirit, seeing that it dislikes pain, would never yoke itself of its own accord to diseases which cause pain.”
11. The real cause of the origin, both of the body and its afflictions, is the mind, known as ‘sattva’, when it is enveloped by passion and ignorance.”
12. But now Varyovida said—“No. this, too, is not right. For the mind by itself cannot be the cause of anything. Thus, without the body there cannot be any disease of the body, nor, for that matter, the mind’s very existence.
13. All creatures are born out of the fluid; so also the various kinds of diseases. The proto-element water, indeed is the basis of all fluids and it is described to be the cause of their manifestation.”
11. Then, Hiranyaksha said—“No For the spirit is not said to be born of the fluid nor even the wind which is supersensnal [super-sensal?]. Besides, there are diseases which spring from sound etc.
15. Man, therefore, is the result of the six elements. The diseases, too, arise from six elements. Thus, the individual was declared by the numerical philosophers to be the aggregate resulting from the union of the six elements, i. e. the five proto-elements and consciousness”.
16. To Kusika who was thus propounding his thesis, the sage Saunaka said:—“No. That is not so. How can the individual spring from the six elements without the agency of the father and mother?
17. Thus, man is born of man, bull of bull, horse of horse and so forth. Thus disease such as the urinary one and others have been said to be hereditary. Therefore, the parents are the origin both of the individual and this disease.
18. But Bhadrakapya said:—“No. For the blind are not born of the blind. Nor can you account on your thesis for the origin of the first parents.
19. Therefore, a creature is said to be born of the merits of action and from merits of action also arise the diseases afflicting him. Tn the absence of action, there is no rise either of man or of disease”.
20. To this the sage Bharadvaja said:—“No. For the doer always precedes the deed. Nor do we know of action un-performed, whereof it may be said that an individual is the result.
21. Nature alone is the cause then of both man and diseases just as roughness, fluidity, mobility and heat are respectively the nature of eather [ether?], water, air and fire”.
22. To this Kankayana said:—“No, For then, effort would either be accomplished or not accomplished simply by the course of nature.
23. So it is the lord of creatures the son of Brahma, possessed of infinite imagination, that is rhe creator of the universe, both animate and inn animate, and of both pleasure and pain.”
24. To this the mendicant Atreya, objecting, said:—“No. That is not so. For surely the lord of creatures would never consign his children, whose welfare he always seeks, to suffering like a malevolent person.
25. Therefore man is an evolute of time, and man’s ailments likewise arc born of time. The whole world is under the suzerainty of time and time is the evolvent everywhere.”
Atreya’s decision
26. Addressing the sages who were thus disputing, the worshipful Punarvasu gave utterance thus:—“Do not dispute in this wise. Truth is hard to find by taking sides in a debate.
27. Those who advance arguments and counter-arguments as if they were finalities, never in fact arrive at any conclusion, going round and round like the man seated on the oil press.
28. Therefore letting go this wordy warfare, apply your minds to the essential truth; but without dispersing the obscuring cloud of passion there can be no proper appreciation of the object that is to be known.
29. The fact is that it is the very elements whose wholesome combination gives rise, to the well-being of man that bring about, in their unwholesome combination, various kinds of diseases”.
30. On hearing this deliverance of the worshipful Atreya, Vamaka, the king of Kasi, once again inquired “Sir, what is the factor that promotes the growth both of man who is born of wholesome combination and of diseases that are born of unwholesome combination?”.
31. To him replied the worshipful Atreya:—“The use of a wholesome diet is the only factor that promotes the healthy growth of man; and the factor that makes for disease is the indulgence in unwholesome diet.”
32-(1). Unto the worshipful Atreya who was thus declaring, Aguivesha put the question—“How, sir shall we know unerringly the characteristics of both, the wholesome and the unwholesome varieties of diet?
32. We ask because we find that the articles of diet that are described as wholesome, as also those that are described as unwholesome tend to produce opposite results by variation in regard to quantity, season, mode of preparation, habitat, constitution, the predominant humor and person.”
33. Unto him the worshipful Atreya said—“O, Agnivesha! Know that, class of foods which helps the harmonized body-elements to retain their state of equilibrium and the discordant body-elements to gain equilibrium, as the wholesome one, and the unwholesome one to be that which acts in the opposite manner. This definition of the wholesome and the unwholesome will be found to be infallible.”
34. Once again to the worshipful Atreya who was thus propounding, Agnivesha said—“Sir, instruction which is given thus, so laconically, is not capable of being understood by the generality of physicians.”
35-(1). To him the worshipful Atreya replied—“O, Agnivesha! those to whom the science of dietetics is known in respect of components and action and in respect of every detail, as well as the proper measure etc., would prefer to learn from instruction imparted in this manner.
35-(2). But in order that the generality of physicians may understand this teaching, we shall give our instruction, without illustration, of the measure etc. These, to be sure, are of various gradations.
35. As regards the variations in the rule concerning diet, we shall explain them with reference both to the ‘General’ and to the ‘Particular.’
The Classification of food
36-(1). The dietic rules are as follows:—Food is all of one kind, eatability being the common feature. But it is of two kinds as regards its sources, one is inanimate and the other animate; it is also twofold in respect of its action, consequent on its being either wholesome or unwholesome in its effect. It is fourfold in respect of its mode of taking, viz., being used as potion, eatable, masticable and lickable. It is sixfold in respect of taste, because there are six categories of taste.
36.It is twenty-fold in respect of properties, viz., heavy, light, cold, hot, unctuous, dry, slow, acute, stable, fluid, soft, hard clear, viscid, refined,, smooth, rough, subtle, gross, dense and liquid. It is of countless variety by reason of the diversity of its ingredients, their combinations and methods of preparation.
37. Nevertheless, we shall enumerate, in due order, such particular classes of articles as are most commonly used and tend by nature to be the most beneficial or the most baneful to the majority of human beings.
The Articles of Diet that are Naturally Wholesome
38. Thus, the most wholesome as diet are—red Shali rice among grains that are furnished with awns (monocotyledons) green gram among pulses (dicotyledons); rain water collected directly among waters; rocksalt among salts; cork-swallow wort among pot-herbs; venison (flesh of Indian antelope) among animal fleshes; the common quail among birds; the iguana among terricolous creatures; the Rohita fish among fishes; cow’s ghee among ghees; cow’s milk among milks; the til oil among vegetable oils; the lard (hog’s fat) among the fats of wetland animals; the fat of the susu (gangetic dolphin) among fish fats; the fat of the white swan among the aquatic birds; the fat of the hen among gallinaceous birds; the fat of goat among the fats of herbivorous animals; ginger among bulbs; the grape among fruits; sugar among the pro ducts of the sugar cane. In this manner, those varieties of foods which are by nature the most wholesome of their class have, in the main, been enumerated.
Articles of Diet that are Naturally Unwholesome
39-(1). Now, we shall enumerate those articles of diet too, that are the most unwholesome. Thus, the most unwholesome as diet are:—wild barley among awned grains, blackgram among pulses; river-water in the rainy season among waters; the salinesoil salt among salts; the rape-seed plant among pot-herbs, beef among animal fleshes; the young dove among the hires; the frog among terricolous creatures; the Cilicima fish among the fishes; the ghee of sheep’s milk among ghees; sheep’s milk among milks; the safflower-oil among vegetable-oils; the fat of the buffalo among the fats of wetland animals; the Gangetic garial among the fats of fishes; the fat of the water-foul among the fats of aquatic birds; the fat of the sparrow among fats of gallinaceous birds; the fat of the elephant among the fats of herbivorous animals; the wild jack-fruit among fruits; the Aluka [āluka] among the bulbs, treacle among all the products of the sugar cane;
39. Thus have been enumerated those varieties of foods, each of which is by nature the most unwholesome of its class. Thus ends the elucidition [elucidation?] of the wholesome and the unwholesome among various kinds of food.
The List of the Foremost among Things

43. Whatever is most efficacious in allaying the discordance of Vata, Pitta and Kapha has been laid dawn; likewise, whatever is best as a remedy in disease-conditions has also been laid down in the main.
44. Having paid heed to these instructions, the skilful man should prescribe the treatment. Acting thus, the physician enjoys constantly both the merits of virtue as well as worldly desires.
45. That is the wholesome regimen which does not impair the bodysystem and which is pleasing to the mind. That which is not pleasing is the unwholesome regimen. This should not be regarded as an invariable rule.
The Advantages of Posology etc.
46. This or that factor, by reason of variation in effects due to measure, time, mode of preparation, habitat of the drug, bodily constitution, and morbid humor, shows itself either as wholesome or unwholesome condition.
47.Hence it is that we have described the innate nature of substances and their dependence far their wholesome effect etc. on measure and the rest. Accordingly, one who desires success should devise treatment with due consideration of both these factors.
48-(1). Having listened to this statement of the worshipful Atreya, Agnivesha asked the worshipful teacher once again. “This subject has been dealt with exhaustively as proposed by your worship, and we too, have followed it diligently.
48. Now, we desire to listen to an unexceptionable description of spirituous beverages given by your reverence in not too brief a manner.”
Sources of Wine
49-(1). To him replied the worshipful Atreya:—“O, Agnivesha! Eight in brief are the sources of spirituous liquors viz., grains, fruits, roots, pith, flowers, stalks, leaves and barks and the ninthly sugar.
The Eighty four varieties of Wine
49-(2). Now listen to the enumeration of the 84 varieties of wines which are considered the most wholesome out of the innumerable varieties resulting from different combinations of the above-mentioned ingredients.
The Various Pharmaceutical Methods of Preparing ‘Wine’
49-(3). Sura [surā], Sauvira [sauvīra], Tushodaka [tuṣodaka], Maireya, Medaka, and Dhanyamla [dhānyāmla] are the six made from corn.

49-(9). Wild snake gourd and palmyra palm are the two plants from whose leaves leaf-wines are manufactured.
49-(10). Tilvaka, lodh, cherry and pathani lodh are the four plants from whose barks, bark-wines are manufactured. Sugar is the only thing from which sugar-wine is manufactured.
49-(11). The eighty-four varieties here mentioned are all produced severally from the different fermentable ingredients unmixed with each other.
49-(12). All these fermented wines are so called because they are obtained by fermentation. Unlimited are the combinations and permutations of which these ingredients are capable and likewise they admit of diverse methods of preparation.
49. Agreeably to their nature and by virtue of the modification resulting from combination and preparation, the wines manifest specific properties. And combination, preparation, time place, and mode of preservation, dose etc., are prescribed in relation to particular wines in view of particular desired results.
The general qualities of Wine
Here is a verse again—
50. Thus have been enumerated the eighty-four kinds of the best wines, which promote the strength of mind, body and digestive fire, dispel insomnia, depression and anorexia and induce exhilaration.
Summary
Here is the recapitulatory verse:—
51. In this chapter entitled “The Origin of Man”, the sage has described the source of the body and of disease, and the different schools of thought thereon, the rules concerning diet and lastly the most excellent among the wines.
25. Thus, in the section on General Principles in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the twenty fifth chapter entitled “The Origin of Man (Purusha-samjnaka—puruṣa-saṃjñaka)” is completed.

7. The following significant discussion took place among these connoisseurs who were seated together there.
8-(1). Bhadrakapya said, “Taste (rasa) is one. The experts declare it to be one of the five sense objects and is experienced by the palate and is not different from water.”
8-(2). The Brahmana named Shakunteya declared, “Tastes (rasa) are two One is depletive and the other impletive.”
8-(3). Maudgalya Purnaksha asserted, “Tastes (rasa) are three—depletive, impletive and the common intermediate one.”
8-(4). Then, Kaushika Hiranyaksha asserted, “Tastes (rasa) are four in number; palatable and wholesome, palatable but unwholesome, unpalatable but wholesome, and unpalatable aud unwholesome.”
8-(5). Bharadvaja known also as Kumarashira then said, “There are five tastes (rasa); those that pertain to earth, water, fire, air and ether.”
8-(6). The royal sage Varyovida exclaimed, “There are six tastes (rasa); the heavy, the light, the cold, the hot, the unctuous and the dry.”
8-(7). Then, Nimi of Videha declared “Seven are the tastes (rasa); the sweet, the sour, the salt, the pungent, the bitter, the astringent and the alkaline.”
8-(8) “There are eight tastes (rasa)”, said Badisha Dhamargava [Dhāmārgava]. “The sweet, the sour, the salt, the pungent, the bitter, the astringent, the alkaline and the imperceptible”.
8. “Innumerable are the tastes (rasa),” affirmed Kankayana, the Bahlika physician, “because of the infinite nature of their substrata, qualities, actions and degrees.”
Atreya’s Decision
9-(1). “Six alone are the tastes (rasa)”, declared the worshipful Atreya Punarvasu. “They are the sweet, the sour, the salt, the pungent, the bitter and the astringent.
9-(1). For all these six tastes (rasa) water is the source. Depletion and impletion are their two functions. From the coalescence of these two functions arises the third, the intermediate one. Palatability and un palatabilty are but a manner of subjective predeliction. Wholesomeness and unwholesomeness are the effects Manifestation of the five proto-elements are merely the substrata conditioned by the factors of nature, modification, combination, clime and season. There manifest in the substrata of the substances the qualities of heaviness, lightness, coldness, heat, unctuousness, dryness etc.
9-(3) Alkali is so named because it alkalizes. It is not a taste but a substance derived from articles of various tastes. It possesses various tastes (rasa)—the pungent and the salt tastes being only the most predominant; it has besides, attributes which can be apprehended by more than one sense and is a manufactured product.
9-(4). As regards the imperceptible taste it is found in their source which is water or in what is known as the after-taste or in things possessing such after-taste.
9-(5). These tastes (rasa) cannot be said to be innumerable because of the innumerable varriety of the substances in which these inhere. Even singly, any of these tastes may be found in an innumerable variety of substances. Thereby the taste does not increase in number like the substances.
9-(6). As these tastes (rasa) are generally found in combination with one anther, the qualities and actions which they display are not innumerable. It is therefore, that the wise do not describe the actions of the tastes in their combinations.
9. Owing to that reason, we shall describe the special characteristics of each of these six tastes severally.
Every Substance is Composed of the Five Elements
10-(1). First of all, we shall make a few observations with reference to the classification of substances.
Substances are of two Kinds; animate and inanimate
10. For the purpose of this science, all substances are products of the five proto-elements; substances are of two kinds: animate and inanimate. Their qualities are the five beginning with heaviness and ending with fluidity. As regards their actions, we have already described their five-fold variety comprising emesis etc.
Classification of Substances according to the Element of Earth etc.
11-(1). Among these, substances that are heavy, rough, hard, slow, stable, clear, dense and gross and abounding in the quality of odor pertain to the proto-element earth. They promote plumpness, compactness, heaviness and stability.
11-(2). Substances that are fluid, unctuous, cold, slow, soft and slimy and abounding in the quality of taste (Rasa-guna—rasaguṇa) pertain to the proto-element water. They produce moisture, unctuousness, union, liquefaction, softness and delight.
11-(3). Substances that are hot, acute, subtle, light, dry and clear and abounding in the quality of form, pertain to the proto-element fire. They produe burning, digestion, radiance, lustre and color.
11-(4). Substances that are light, cold, dry rough, clear and subtle and abounding in the quality of touch, pertain to the proto-element air. They produce dryness, depression, morbidity, clearness and lightness.
11. Substances that are. soft, light, subtle and smooth and abounding in the quality of sound, pertain to the proto-element ether. They produce softness, porousness and lightness.
All Substances are Medicinal
12. In the light of this knowledge, there is in the world no substance that may not be used as medicine in this or that manner for this or that purpose.
13-(1). It is not exclusively by virtue of their qualities that substances are active.
13. Whatever, therefore, substances do, whether by virtue of their nature as substances, or by virtue of their qualities, or by virtue of both, their substantive and qualitative natures, in any given time, at any given place, having been administered in a given mode, with a given result in view—all that is their action. Where by they act is the potency. Wherein they act is the place. When they act is the time. How they act is the mode. What they achieve is the result.
Sixty three Varieties according to their Tastes (rasa)
14 The variation in tastes (rasa), giving rise to their sixty three fold classification, proceeds from the varying influence of substance, place and of time. This, we shall now describe.
15. Sweet mixed with sour and other tastes, and sour and other tastes combined with the rest of them in their order make fifteen substances or abodes of the twin tastes
16-16½. The sweet combining separately with each of the remaining five tastes of sour etc. forms five binary tastes. Similarly, the other tastes too beginning with sour, combine with each other to from ten fresh binary groups of tastes. There are thus altogether fifteen separate binary groups of tastes. The sweet, sour, salt and the pangent tastes, which having combine 1 separately with each of the tastes beginning with the sour, combine again severally with one of the remaining tastes in the given order to yield twenty distinct groups of trinary tastes.
17-18. The quaternary groups of tastes (rasa) are stated to be fifteen. They are formed thus. The binary group of street and sour tastes, combines in six different ways with any two of the remaining tastes beginning with salt. They thus form quaternary group of tastes
19-20½. Thereafter, the binary group of sweet and salt combining consecutively with pungent, bitter and astringent, forms with the addition of sour, astringent and pungent respectively, three separate quaternary groups of tastes. Thereafter, the bina-ry group of sweet and pungent com bining with the residuary binary group of bitter and astringent tastes, forms the quaternary group of tastes. Thus with the sweet taste as a constant factor, there are ten distinct groups of quaternary taste. Now, dropping the sweet taste, the binary group of sour and salt combining consecutively with pungent, sour and astringent tastes, forms with the addition respectively of bitter, astringent and pungent tastes, three separate groups of quaternary taste. (1) Sour-salt pungent-bitter, (2) Sour-salt-bitter-astringent, (3) Sour-salt-astringent-pungent. Now, dropping the salt taste, the binary group of sour and salt combine with the residuary dyad of bitter and astringent to form me fresh quaternary group of tastes. Finally, dropping both sweet and sour tastes, salt and pungent combine with astringent and bitter to from the fifteenth and the last quaternary group of tastes.
21 21½. By dropping from the total complex of tastes one taste at a time, there are formed six groups of quinary taste. There now remain the six groups of single tastes and the single group of six tastes.
Innumerability of the Varieties in the Combinations of Tastes and after-tastes
22-23. In this manner are the substances divided into 63 groups according to the distribution on tastes. This number of sixty-three swells into an incomputable figure if the after-tastes are taken into count; likewise, if the comparative and superlative degrees of tastes (rasa) are taken into consideration, the sum goes beyond computation.
For Purposes of therapeusis 64 Varieties Have been taken
24. in view of the above, the experts conversant with the science of tastes, have in view limited the practical requirements of medicine, to 57 groups of combined tastes and 63 groups of all tastes, single and combined.
The Combination of Tastes (rasa)
25. The physician desirous of success, considering well the nature of the disease, and the action of the remedy, must prescribe either a single taste or a combination of tastes as required
26. According to the disease, substances of two or more tastes, or of combination of multiple tastes or of one only are used by wise physicians.
The Nature of Taste (rasa) and after-taste
27. He who is well aware of the classification of tastes (rasa) as well as of the classification of morbid humors, will not fall into error regarding the etiology, symptoms aud remedial measures.
28.That savour which becomes patent on the first contact of a dry substance with the tongue is declared to be its taste (rasa). What is otherwise apprehended is its latent or after-taste. The Qualities of Superior etc.
29-30. Priority, non-priority, application, number, synthesis, analysis, particularity, measure, preparation and practice:—these ten constitute the complex of qualities beginning with priority They are the means of success in treatment. We shall describe their characteristics.
Their Characteristics
31-35. Priority and non-priority are determined with reference to place, time, age, dosage, digestion, potency, taste (rasa) and other factors, that is application which effects the most favourable conjunction of these factors. Number is computation. Synthesis is the term for the coming together of various substances, such synthesis may be due to the action of both, all or of one of the constituents, and is in every case temporary. Analysis is resolution, i.e., taking things piece meal or in parts. Particularity rests on disjunction, difference or plurality. Measure is meting out. Preparation is modification. Practice is repeated use, i.e. forming a habit by constant performance. We have thus set out the whole gamut of qualities beginning with priority, defining their characteristics without a knowledge of which treatment cannot proceed rightly.
The Qualities of Substances in terms of the Tastes (rasa)
36. It has been stated that qualities cannot be their own substrata. Accordingly when we say that such are the qualities of tastes (Rasa-guna—rasaguṇa) which are themselves qualities, the physicians understand that we really have in mind the substances which are the the substrata of these tastes (rasa).
The Sense to be understood Suitably to each Context
37. Many are the ways in which an author expresses his ideas. Hence it is after due appreciation of the context of the particular place and time in question, the intention of the author and technicalitiles [technicalities?] of the science, that the meaning of the text should be determined.
The Sources of the Tastes (rasa)
38. Hereafter, we shall explain the six divisions of tastes (rasa) and how they are born of the five protoelements,
39. Water represents the aqueous element. During its suspension in the sky, it is cold by nature, light, and is devoid of any perceptible taste. Subsequent to its precipitation from the sky, it becomes associated with the qualities of the five proto-elements. It sustains all bodies of animal and plant life. It is in these bodies that it develops into the six categories of taste (rasa).
The Excess of each Taste referable to the Excess of Particular Elements
40-(1). Of these six tastes, the sweet taste is born of the preponderance of the water element, the sour taste is born of the preponderance of the earth and the fire elements; the salt taste is born of the preponderance of the water and the fire elements; the pungent taste is born of the preponderance of the air and the fire elements; the bitter taste is born of the preponderance of the air and the ether elements and the astringent taste is born of the preponderance of the air and the earth elements.
40-(2). Tn this manner, by virtue of the preponderance or paucity of the one or the other of the five protoelements, the six categories of taste emerge in the same way as the diversities of color and shape of the animal and vegetable forms emerge.
40. The varying gradation of pre ponderance or paucity of the protoelements is, in turn, due to the six aspects of time as represented in the six seasons.
41-(1). Among these, the tastes (rasa) which are of the nature of fire and air have, for the most part, a tendency to go upwards by virtue of the light and soaring quality of air and the propensity of fire to flame upwards.
41-(2). Whereas, tastes (rasa) which are of the nature of water and earth have, for the most part, a tendency to go downwards by virtue of the heavy nature of earth and the propensity of water to flow downwards.
41. The tastss [tastes?] of a mixed nature evince both these tendencies.
The Qualities and Action of each Taste (rasa)
42. We shall expound the attributes and actions of each of these six tastes with reference to the substance in which it inheres.
The Sweet Taste
43. Of them, the sweet taste being homologous to the body, increases the body-nutrient fluid, blood, flesh, fat, bone, marrow, vital essence and semen; prolongs life; clarifies the sense organs; imparts vigor and complexion; alleviates Pitta, toxicosis and Vata; and allays thirst and burning sensation. It has a beneficial influence on the skin, hair, voice and strength. It promotes cheerfulness vitality and satisfaction. It renders the body roborant and firm. It acts as a synthesizer in pectoral lesions. It enlivens the functions of the nose, mouth, throat, lips and the tongue and allays internal burning sensation and fainting. It is extremely liked by the bees and the ants, and is unctuous, cold and heavy.
43-(2). Though possessed of these qualities, if it is used exclusively or overmuch, it produces corpulence, softness, lethargy, hypersomnia, heaviness, inappetence, weakness of the gastric fire, hypertrophy of the tissues in the mouth and throat, dyspnea, cough, coryza, intestinal torpor, algid fever preceded by cold, constipation, sweet taste in the mouth, vomiting, loss of consciousness and voice, deradenoncus, chain of deradenoncuses, elephantiasis swelling of the throat, increase of mucus, discharge from bladder, vessels and throat; and eye-diseases with increased mucus, and similar other diseases born of Kapha.
The Acid Taste
43-(3). The acid taste adds relish to the dish, stimulates the digestive fire, buids [builds?] up the body and invigo, rates it, enlightens the mind, stabilises the sense functions, promotes the strength and regulates the peristaltic movement of Vata. It invigorates the heart, causes salivation, conducts the food downwards, moistens, digests and gives pleasure; and is light, hot and unctuous.
43-(4). Though possessed of these qualities, if it is used exclusively or overmuch, it sets the teeth on edge, provokes thirst, causes flinching of the eyes, horripilation, dissolves Kapha, increases Pitta, vitiates the blood, causes the sloughing of the flesh, renders the body flabby and causes edema in those that are wasted, cachectic, emaciated or debilitated.
43-(5). On account of its fiery quality it leads to the suppuration of the inflammations induced by various kinds of trauma, such as wounds, contagious bites, burns, fractures, swellings, dislocation, toxic urine, or contact of venomous creatures, bruise, excision, incision, separation, puncture, crushing and similar injuries. It causes an allround sensation of burning in the throat, chest and heart.
The Salt Taste
43-(6). The salt taste is diffusive; it is liquefacient, digestive, inducive of defluxion, depletive and disruptive, acute, fluid, diffusive, laxative, deobstruent, curative of Vata, stiffness, obstruction and accumulations; overpowers the rest of tastes and is increasive of secretion of the mouth. It liquefies the mucus secretion, clarifies the passages, softens all the limbs of the body, gives relish to food, is always used in food, is neither very heavy nor very unctuous and is hot.
43-(7). Though possessed of all these qualities, if it is used exclusively or overmuch, it provokes the Pitta, increases the blood, provokes thirst, causes fainting and great heat, disruption, corrosion of the flesh, is discutient of the dermic lesions, aggravates the symptoms of toxicosis, breaks open swellings dislodges the teeth, destroys manhood, impairs the function of the sense-organs, induces premature wrinkles, grey hair and baldness.
43-(8). Also, it predisposes one to hemothermia, acid dyspepsia, acute spreading affections, rheumatic conditions, bullous eruptions and alopecia and similar other conditions.
The Pungent taste
43-(9). The pungent taste purifies the mouth, stimulates the gastric fire, desiccates the food, causes the nose to run and the eyes to water, sharpens the sense-organs, is curative of intestinal torpor, edema, obesity, urticaria, excessive fluidity, unctuousness, perspiration, Softening, and eliminative of excretory matter, gives relish to food, cures pruritus, allays the excessive growth of granulations is anthelmintic, lacerates the flesh, splits open accumulations of blood, removes obstructions, dilates the passages, aud allays Kapha; it is light, hot and dry.
43-(10). Though possessed of all these qualities, if it is used exclusively or overmuch, it destroys manhood on account of its post-digestive effects, and on account of its taste and potency it induces stupefaction, gives rise to weariness, asthenia, emaciation, fainting, flexion, choking, giddiness and allround burning sensation in the throat; it produces great heat in the body; diminishes strength and produces thirst.
43-(11). Also, on account of its having the qualities of air and fire in preponderance, it generates various kinds of Vata-disorders in the legs, arms, sides and back attended with giddiness, burning, tremors, pricking and stabbing pains.
The Bitter Taste
43(12). The bitter taste, though inappetive in taste, is yet appetising in action. It is antidotal to poison, vermicidal, curative of fainting, burning, itching, dermatosis and thirst. It imparts firmness to the skin and flesh; it is febrifuge, digestive-stimulant, digestive, purificatory of breastmilk, depletive, and desiccant of moisture, fat, flesh-marrow, bone-marrow, lymph, pus, sweat, urine, feces, bile and mucus. It is dry, cold and light.
43-(13). Though possessed of these qualities, if it is used exclusively or overmuch, on account of its dry, rough and clear nature, it dries the body nutrient fluid, blood, flesh, fat, bone, marrow and semen. It renders the channels rough and deprives one of strength. It induces emaciation, weariness, fainting, giddiness and it dries up the mouth and generates many other Vata disorders.
The astringent Taste
43-(14). The astringent taste is sedative, astringent in action, synthesizing, compressive, henotic, desiccant, styptic and sedative of Kapha, blood and Pitta. It consumes the body-fluid and is dry and cold and it is not light
43. Though possessed of these qualities, if it is used exclusively or overmuch, it dries up the mouth, afflicts the heart, distends the stomach, impedes the speech, constricts the body-channels, causes cyanosis, impairs manhood and, being retarded, it gets slowly digested. It inhibits flatus, urine, feces and semen. It induces emaciation, weariness, thirst, stiffness and, being of a rough, clear and dry mature, it engenders various Vata disorders, such as hemiplegia, spasm, convulsions and facial paralysis.
44-(1). These six tastes (rasa) become beneficial to living creatures by being properly administered in this manner, either separately or in combination and in the proper dose. If used otherwise they become injurious to life.
44. Accordingly, the wise physician should make use of the tastes in the right measure aud manner, so that they are invariably beneficial.
The Potency of Substances determined by their tastes
Here are verses again—
45. That substance which is sweet in taste and post-digestive effect is cold in potency. That which is acid in taste and post-digestive effect is hot in potency. Similarly, that which is pungent in taste and post digestive effect is hot in potency.
46. Their qualities are so to be judged by their tastes. But those that are, in action and assimilation, contrary to their tastes are explained hereafter.
47. As regards substances which do not behave contrarily to the general rule concerning potency and post-digestive changes, their actions should be determined according to the indications of taste. As instances we may give milk, ghee, chabba pepper and white-flowered leadwort. In the same manner, the physician should determine the actions of other drugs too, by taste.
Taste (rasa) is not the sole guide to the Entire nature of a Substance
48-49. (The following are examples of substances which do not conform to the general rule of potency and post-digestive effect). Substances may be sweet in taste and yet hot in potency. Again, substances may be astringent and bitter in taste but hot in potency. An instance of the first is the flesh of the aquatic and wetland animals, and that of the second is major pentaradices. Rocksalt, though of salt taste, is not hot in potency. Similarly, the emblic myrobalan, though of acid taste, is not hot in potency. Substances like mudar, eagle-wood and guduch, though of bitter taste, are hot in potency.
50. Similarly, some substances of acid taste are astringent in action, while others of the same taste are laxative; as for example, wood apple is astringent and the emblic myrobalan is laxative.
51. Though substances of pungent taste are regarded as anaphrodisiac, long pepper and dry ginger act as aphrodisiacs. Substances of astringent taste are generally considered astringent and cold in action but chebulic myrobalan acts contrarily to this rule.
52. Not all substances should therefore be judged solely by the criterion of taste (rasa); for, as shown above, substances may possess the same taste and yet differ from each other in action.
The potency of taste an indication to the high, moderate or low quality
53-54. As regards the quality of dryness, the astringent taste possesses it in the highest degree, the pungent in the moderate degree and the bitter in the minimum degree. Similary, as regards the hot quality, salt possesses it in the greatest degree, the acid taste in the moderate, and the pungent in the lowest degree. As regards the unctuous quality, the sweet taste possesses it in the highest, the acid taste in the moderate, and the salt in the lowest degree.
55. As regards the cold quality, the sweet taste possesses it the most, the astringent taste moderately and the bitter taste the least. Regarding the heavy quality, the sweet state possesses it in the highest degree, the astringent in the moderate degree, and the salt in the lowest degree.
56-56½. With reference to the light quality the bitter taste possesses it in the highest measure, the pungent taste in the moderate measure and the acid taste in the lowest measure. Another school is of opinion that salt possesses the light quality in the lowest degree. Thus in both schools of thought, salt occupies the lowest place in the scale—whether with regard to heaviness or lightness.
The Post-digestive effect of tastes (rasa)
57-58. Hereafter we shall give a description of the post-digestive changes affecting tastes. Substances of the pungent, bitter and astringent tastes are, on digestion, generally converted into pungent tastes. The acid taste becomes on digestion acid, and the sweet becomes sweet, so also the salt taste becomes sweet
The Action of the Post-digestive effect of sweet and other tastes
59. The sweet, the salt and the acid tastes, on account of their unctuous quality, are generally considered helpful in the elimination of flatus, urine and feces.
60. The pungent, bitter and astringent tastes, on account of their dry quality, are found to render the elimination of flatus, urine and feces difficult.
61. The pungent taste formed after digestion promotes Vata and causes diminution of seminal secretion and the suppression of feces and urine; while the sweet taste formed after digestion is promotive of Kapha and causative of increase of semen and elimination of feces and urine.
62. The acid taste formed after digestion promotes Pitta, diminishes the semen and promotes the elimination of feces and semen. Of these three tastes formed on post-digestion, the sweet is heavy, while the pungent and the acid are otherwise.
The high, moderate or low nature of the post-digestive effect due to the peculiar quality of substances
63. The minium, moderare, or maxium degrees of the charactaristics, of post-digestive tastes should be determined according to the degree of the characteristics of that particular substance.
The varieties of Potency and their characteristics
64-65. Potency of a substance is thought to be of eight kinds by some viz., soft, acute heavy, light, unctuous, dry, hot and cold. Others think it to be of two kinds only viz., hot and cold. Potency is the power by which an action takes place. Nothing can be done in the absence of potency. Every action is the result of potency.
The different aspects of taste, quality and potency reside in the substance
66. The taste (rasa) of a substance is felt at the commencement only, i.e. when the substance comes into contact with the tongue; and the post-digestive changes are felt only when the final effects of digestion are produced; while potency is observed throughout its stay in the body beginning from its first entrance.
The nature of Specific action
67. Where there exists a similarity in taste (rasa), potency and post-digestive changes, and yet a difference in action is observed, such special differerence in action is called the specific action of the substance.
The Illustrations of Specific action
68. For example, white-flowered leadwort is pungent in taste and in post-digestive effect and hot in potency. Red physic nut is similar in all these respects and yet, by reason of its specific action it acts as a purgative when administered to a man.
69. Poison is said to counteract the effects of poison. Here, too, the specific action is the deciding factor. The action of stimulating the peristaltic movement upward or downward is also dependent on specific action.
70-70½. The manifold virtues accruing from wearing precious stones and drugs on the body are also due to specific action. Specific action is considered inexplicable. Thus, we have duly explained the post-digestive effects, potency and also specific action.
71-71½. Some substances act in accordance with their tastes, others in accordance with their potency and yet others in accordance with their qualities or post digestive effect or specific action.
72-72½. When taste and the rest are evenly balanced in their strength, the following is the normal order of their relative influence. Post-digestive effect is stronger and more powerful than that of taste, the influence of potency is mere powerful than the preceding two, while specific action is the most powerful of all.
The specific knowledge of the six tastes (rasa)
73-74. Hereafter, we shall describe the specific characteristics of each of the six tastes (rasa). The sweet taste is recognised in the mouth by its effects of unctuousness, satisfaction, pleasure and softness. Spreading all over the mouth, it induces a feeling as if the mouth were besmeared with sweetness.
75. That should be called the acid taste which causes the setting of teeth on edge, salivation, sweating, stimulation of the sense of taste and burning in the mouth and throat immediately on contact with these parts.
76 That should be known as the salt taste which, owing to the burning sensation it induces in the mouth, gives rise, on being dissolved, to conditions of moistness, deliquescence and softness in the mouth.
77. That is known as the pungent taste which on contact with the tongue causes irritation and pricking sensation and, giving rise to burning of the mouth, nose and eyes, induces flow of water from them.
78. That should be known as the bitter taste which on coming into contact with the tongue causes loss of the sensation of taste, is not pleasant to the tongue, and induces clearness, dryness and keenness in the mouth.
79. That is the astringent taste which produces clear, astringent and dulling effects on the tongue and a sense of constriction in the threat and is also antispasmodic in action.
Indication in brief of incompatible Articles of diet
80. The worshipful Atreya having spoken thus, Agnivesha said to him, “O worshipful one! We have duly listened to your words, true and rich in meaning, on the subject of the qualities and actions of substances. Now we should like to listen to your observations given out, in not too concise a manner, on the subject of incompatibility of dietary articles.”
81-(1) The worshipful Atreya answered him, “Articles of diet that are inimical to the body-elements tend to disagree with the system.
81.This incompatibility is of several kinds. Some articles are mutually incompatible on account of their qualities; some articles became so when combined; some by the mode of preparation; and some by the conditioning factors of place, time, dose, etc; and some by their very nature.
Illustration of such incompatible Articles of diet.
82-(1). Now, with reference to those articles of diet which are most commonly used, we shall make some observations, restricting ourselves to a particular incompatibility in each case.
82. Thus, fish should not be eaten in conjunction with milk. While both alike are sweet in taste, sweet in post-digestive effects and hyper-liquefacient, they are yet incompatible in the matter of potency, one being cold and the other hot. Being thus incompatible in potency, they tend to vitiate the blood and by reason of their hyper-liquefacient character, they tend to cause obstruction of the channels.”
83-(1). On hearing these words of Atreya, Bhadrakapya said to Agnivesha:—“With the sole exception of the variety of fish called ‘Cilicima’, all the rest may be eaten with milk.
83. But the Cilicima which is scaly, red eyed and red-striped, and resembles the Rohita fish, is amphibious, lying for the must part on land. If this creature were eaten with milk it would doubtless result in one or the other of the diseases arising from vitiation of blood, or obstipation of the body-channels, or even in death.”
84-(1). “No!” replied the worshipful Atreya. “No fish of any kind ought to be eaten with milk, this interdiction applying even more strongly in the case of Cilicima.
84-(2). Having an exceedingly liquefacient action, the Cilicima gives rise to the diseases mentioned, in a specially aggravated form; in addition, it produces intestinal toxemia.
84-(3). The flesh of domesticated, wet land or of aquatic creatures should not be eaten in conjunction with honey, til, gur, milk, black gram, garden radish, lotus stalks or sprouted grains.
84-(4). It is on account of such mixed diet that one develops deafness, blindness, tremors, idiocy, indistinctness of speech, nasal articulation, or comes by one’s death.
34-(5). The leaves of gelmeniris, kurroa or the flesh of pigeon fried in rape-seed oil must not be eaten together with honey and milk.
84-(6). It is from such mixed diet that one falls a victim to one or the other of the diseases such as increased liquidity of the blood, dilatation of the vessels, epilepsy, shankhaka [śaṅkhaka], deradenoncus, Rohini [rohiṇī] or to death itself.
84-(7) One must not drink milk having eaten garden radish, garlic, moringa, large basil, holy basil, or shrubby basil, for fear of developing dermatosis.
84-(8). Jatuka-shakha [jātukaśāka] and ripe lakoocha must not be eaten with honey or milk.
84 (9). For, such practice brings about death or the loss of strength, complexion, radiance and virility or some other major disease, or impotency.
84-(10). Ripe lakoocha should not be used with black gram soup, or with gur and ghee as such combination is incompatible.
84-(11).

Thus, everything has been explained in accordance with the questions.
The Nature of unwholesome diet
Here are some verses again—
85. Whatever articles of food, having dislodged the morbid humors, do not eliminate them from the body, are to be regarded as unwholesome.
86-87. That substance is unwholesome which is incompatible from the point of view of country, season, gastric fire, measure, homologation, Vata and other body humors, preparation, potency, bowel-tendency, state of the patient, rules of eating, things to be avoided or observed, cookery, combination, palatability, richness of quality and rules of eating.
88. The use of dry and acute drugs in an arid country and the use of unctuous and cold things in a wet country are examples of incompatibility of diet with reference to dime.
89 The use of cold, dry and similar things in winter and the use of pungent, hot and similar things in summer are examples of incompatibility of diet with reference to season.
90. Food not taken in accordance with the given type of any of the four types of the gastric fire constitutes the incompatibility of diet with reference to the gastric fire. The combination of ghee and honey in equal quantities is an example of the incompatibility of diet with reference to measure.
91-91½. The taking of sweet and cold things by a person to whom only pungent and hot substances are homologous is an example of incompatibility of diet with reference to homologation. The use of articles of diet, drugs and procedures which are similar in quality to that of the susceptible body-humors constitutes humoral incompatibility.
92-92½. The incompatibility of preparation is that where food is converted into poison during the course of preparation, as, for example, in the case of the peacock’s flesh roasted on a spit made of a stick of the castor plant.
93-93½. The use of substances of cold potency in combination with substances of hot potency is to be known as incompatibility of potency,
94-941. That is known as incompatibility of bowel-tendency where a hard-bowelled person is administered a drug, small in dose, weak in potency, and poor in laxative quality; or where a soft-bowelled person is given a drug heavy, cathartic and in a large dose,
95-96. That is incompatibility with reference to the state of the patient, where a Vata-provoking meal is given to one who is exhausted by fatigue, sexual act or physical strain. Similarly, if a Kapha provoking meal is given to one subject to the lethargy of sleep or indolence, it also constitutes such incompatibility.
97. That is incompatibility of rules of eating when a person takes his meal without relieving himself of the urge for feces and urine or eats without the feeling of hunger or does not eat in spite of severe hunger.
98. That is incompatibility of the rules of prohibition and injunction where a person takes hot substances after a meal of the flesh of a boar and similar animals, or eats cooling things after taking ghee aud similar articles.
99-(1). That is culinary incompatibility where food is prepared with bad and rotten fuel, or is undercooked or overcooked or burnt.
99-99½. That is incompatibility of combination where sour things are taken with milk, That is incombility [incompatibility?] of palatability where an article of food is unpleasant of taste (rasa).
100-100½. That is incompatibility with reference to richness of quality where the juice is taken of unripe, over-ripe or putrified substances.
101. That is incompatibility of the rules of eating where food is not taken in a solitary place. Food taken in any of the above-mentioned ways constitutes dietetic incompatibility.
The diseases due to such incompatible Diet
102-103. Impotency, blindness, acute spreading affections, abdominal affections, eruptions, insanity, fistula, fainting, intoxication, tympanitis, trismus, aremia, chyme-toxemia, leprosy, dermatosis, assimilation disorders, edema, acid dyspepsia, fever, rhinitis, fatal diseases and death:—these are said to result from the incompatibility of diet.
Their Treatment
104-(1). The following are the counter-measures for these and other diseases caused by an incompatible dietary.
104. They are:—emesis, purgation, the administration of sedatives that counteract the diseases mentioned as also the prophylactic measures due to dietetic incompatibility.
Here are two verses again—
105. Purgation, emesis, sedation and prophylactic measures counteract the disorders born of the incompatibility of diet.
Why sometimes incompatible diet does No harm
105. Dietetic incompatibility becomes neutralized, under the following circumstances, if the incompatibility is homologous to the person concerned, if it is slight, if the person concerned is of strong digestive power, if he is young or if he has an abundance of the unctuous element in his body and if he is strong from exercise.
Summary
Here are the recapitulatory verses:—
107. Whatever were the views of the great sages in the determination of tastes (rasa), substances with their attributes and actions, the numerality of substances and tastes;
108. The reason behind the enumeration, tastes, after-tastes, the characteristics of each of the ten qualities beginning with priority etc;
109. How the tastes (rasa) of the five proto-elements become divided into six categories and the preponderance of this or that quality by which they develop the tendency of going upwards or downward;

112. The specific characteristics of the six tastes (rasa) on coming into contact with the organ of taste; What liquids are incompatible with what liquids and for what cause and what diseases are produced by what incompatible substances.
113. And the diseases caused by such incompatibilities and their remedial measures:—all these, has the sage declared in the chapter entitled “The discussion between Atreya and Bhadrakapya”.
26. Thus, in the Section on General Principles in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the twenty sixth chapter entitled “The discussion between Atreya and Bhadrakapya” is completed.
The Natural Qualities of water etc.
4-(1). O Agnivesha; we shall, there fore, describe in full the science of diet and dietetics (annapana-vidhi), for the sake of the knowledge of the wholesome and the unwholesome among things
4-(2). By its very nature, water moistens, salt liquefies, alkali digests, honey synthesizes, ghee causes unctuousness, milk gives life flesh causes roborance, meat-juice nourishes, wine causes senile degeneration Sidhu [sīdhu] wine causes emaciation, grape-wine stimulates digestion, treacle causes accumulation or morbid humors, curds cause edema, green Pinyaka [piṇyāka] causes depression.
The Normal Qualities of Tastes and Their exceptions
4. The soup of black gram increases fecal matter. The alkalis are injurious to vision and semen. All substances of acid taste except pomegranate and the emblic myrobalan are mostly Pitta-promoters. All substances of sweet taste, except honey, old shali rice, shashtika-rice, barley and wheat are generally Kapha-promoters. All substances or bitter taste, except the sprouts of country-willow, guduch and the wild snake gourd, are mostly Vata-stimulants and anaphrodisiacs. All substances with pungent taste, except long pepper and ginger, are Vata-stimulants and anaphrodisiacs.
5. We shall now expound the different classifications of the articles of diet.
6-7. Cora, pulse, meat, vegetable fruits, greens, wines, water, milk and its products, sugarcane and its products—these ten and two more, viz. cooked food and the adjuvants of foods; of these, we shall now explain the taste, potency, post-digestive qualities and specific properties.
[Classification of Dietetic Articles in Brief]
[1. The group of awned cereals (monocotyledons)]
[2. The group of pulses (dicotyledons)]
[3. The group of meats]
[4. The group of vegetables]
[5. The group of Fruits]
[6. The group of Greens]
[7. The group of Wines]
[8. The section on Waters]
[9. The section on Cow’s milk]
[10. The class of Sugarcane]
[11. The group of Cooked foods]
[12. The section on the articles used in cooked foods]
[The characteristics of eats and drinks]
309. Corn and pulses that are one year old are recommended. The old grain is generally dry and the new generally heavy.
310. That grain which grows quicker is considered lighter than the others. The decorticated and slightly roasted pulse is digested easily.
311-311½. The flesh of the animal which is dead, emaciated, very fat, old, too young, killed by poisoning, reared in unnatural habitat or killed by a tiger or snake should be avoided. The flesh of the contrary description is wholesome, roborant and promotive of strength.
The qualities of Meat-juice
312-313. For all creatures the meat-juice is most nourishing and cord[..??] and for those that are washed[?] convalescing, emaciated, deficient in semen and desirous of enhanced strength and complexion, meat-juice is to be regarded as nectar itself.
314. Meat-juice administered as indicated is curative of most diseases. It should be regarded as promotive of voice, youth, intelligence, sense-faculties and longevity.
315. If those given to constant exercise and indulgence in women and wine take meat-juice daily, they will never fall ill or become weak
The avoidables among vegetables
316. Vegetable spoilt by maggots, wind or sun, or dried or decayed or gown out of season or cooked with out unctuous substances or with the boiled water not drained off, should be avoided.
The avoidables among fruits
317. Fruits which are old, or unripe or damaged by insects, snakes, frost or sun-heat and which are of improper season and place and putrified are to be regarded as not good for use.
The avoidables among Greens, Wines, Waters and Milks
318. The rules regarding greens are the same as vegetables, except in the mode of preparation. As regards wine, water and milk etc. these have been described in their respective sections.
Recommendation regarding food and drink
319. That drink which is opposite in quality to that of the food taken is the proper corrigent. Whatever drink is not deleterious to the body-elements is to be considered the right post-prandial drink.
320. One should take as his post prandial drink that which is wholesome, having examined the eighty-four kinds of wines described previously and which water is fit to be drunk and which not
Recommendation regarding food and drink in Vata and other disorders and in Wasting
321. Unctuous and hot drinks in conditions of Vata, sweet and cooling ones in those of Pitta, dry and hot ones in Kapha, and meat-juices in wasting are considered the best.
Milk as a potion in fasting and other conditions
322. For those fatigued by fasting, travel, lecturing, society of women, wind, sun and exertion, milk as a post-prandial drink is as wholesome as nectar.
Sura wine in emaciation and hydromel in corpulence
323. Sura wine is to be prescribed as a post-prandial drink for building up the emaciated. Hydromel (honey-water) is recommended as a postprandial drink for reducing the corpulent.
Wine as post-prandial drink
324. For those suffering from weak gastric fire and insomnia as the result of torpor, grief, fear and fatigue and for those accustomed to wine and meat, wine is prescribed as a postprandial drink.
The effects of post prandial beverage
325. Now we shall speak of the qualities and actions of post-prandial drink. Post-prandial drink gives nourishment, pleasure, energy, roborance, sense of satisfaction, settles down the food eaten, breaks up the mass of food, imparts softness, liquefies, digests and brings about quick assimilation and diffusion in the body.
Here is a verse again:—
326. Post prandial drink that is rightly administered satisfies the man immediately and digests the food happily and gives life and strength. Conditions in which water as post prandial potion is interdicted
327-328 Neither these in whom the Vata is provoked in the upper parts of the body nor those that suffer from hiccup, dyspnea or cough, nor those that are engaged in singing, lecturing or studying, nor those that are suffering from the pectoral lesions should drink water after eating; for it takes away from the throat and chest the unctuous quality of the meal eaten and leads to great morbidity.
The qualities of undescribed substances to be ascertained
329. The foods and drinks (annapana) that are generally in use are described; for it is not possible to indicate the totality of substances by their names.
330. Since there is no substance which may not be used as a medicine, the substances not spoken of here are to be assessed with reference to their qualities according to the opinion cf the people in whose country they are found.
The qualities of creatures according to their habitat and food
331. An animal’s food and habitat, body-parts, constitution, body elements, activity, sex, size, mode of preparation and measure are herein explained.
332-333. Wet-land, water, sky, arid-land and the feed constitute an animal’s habitat and food Animals which are native to water and wetland or eat heavy things, are all to be regarded as heavy. The light feeders are light, such as those native to arid land and moving in arid land.
The relative qualities of their body limbs
334 335. The body-limbs are the thigh bone, head, shoulder and others. The shoulder is heavier than the flesh of the thigh-bone. The chest is heavier than the shoulder and the head is heavier than the chest. The testes, skin, phallus, hips, kidneys, liver, rectum trunk and bane-marrow are to be regarded as heavier than the flesh in the body of an animal.
Heavy and light qualities by nature
336. By nature green gram is light; so, too, are quail and grey-partridge. Black gram is by nature heavy and the fleshes of hog and buffalo too are likewise,
Heavy and light qualities of body-elements
337. The blood and the other body-elements should be regarded as increasingly heavy in their due order. Creatures that ar-e given to much activity are lighter than those that are lethargic.
Heavy or light qualities according to sex
338. Heaviness is the characteristic of the males in general, while lightness is the characteristic of females. Those that are huge of size in each class are heavy and those that are otherwise are light.
Heavy or light due to culinary processes
339. The heavy articles, it should be, known, become light by preparation and the light ones become heavy just as rice becomes light when roasted and roasted corn flour becomes heavy when prepared into balls and cooked.
Quality determines the measure of food
340 The proper measure of heavy and light articles of diet has been described as intake of heavy articles in small measure and of light ones in a large measure.
341. Hence heavy articles should be taken in small measure and light ones to full satisfaction. Articles of diet should be taken in proper measure and the proper measure should be in accordance with the strength of gastric fire.
Measure in food dependent on the gastric fire
342. Strength, health, longevity and the vital breath are dependent on the state of the gastric fire, and the gastric fire burns, fed by the fuel of food and drink, or dwindled when deprived of them.
Measure to whom applicable and to whom not
343. This consideration of heavy and light articles is with reference to those that are generally weak, indolent, unhealthy, delicate of health and given to luxury.
344. With reference to those whose digestive fire is inflamed, who are accustomed to hard articles of diet, who are given to constant labour and have huge capacity for the consumption of food, the consideration of heavy and light qualities of things is not necessary.
345. The self-controlled man should always feed his gastric fire with the fuel of wholesome food and drink (annapana), mindful of the consideration of measure and time.
346-347. The man whose gastric fire is well tended, who feeds it duly with wholesome diet, who is given to daily meditation, charity and the pursuit of spiritual salvation, and who takes food and drinks that are homologatory to him, will not fall victim to approaching diseases except for special reasons.
348. The disciplined man that practises wholesome diet lives for a period of 36000 nights i.e. hundred years blessed by good men and free from disease.
In praise of Food
349-349½. The life of all living things is food and all the world seeks food. Complexion, clarity, good voice, long life, understanding, happiness, satisfaction, growth, strength and intelligence are all established in food.
350-350½. Whatever is beneficial for worldly happiness, whatever pertains to the vedic sacrifices leading to heaven and whatever action leads to spiritual salvation is said to be established in food.
Summary
Here is the recapitulatory verse:—
351-352. The characteristics of eats and drinks, the twelve classifications of articles of diet (Annapana-guna—annapānaguṇa) together with the foremost of them, the post-prandial drinks with their characteristics and the statement in brief regarding heaviness and lightness of the articles of diet, have all been described in this chapter on diet and dietetics. This subject is worthy of special study.
27. Thus in the Section on General Principles in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the twenty-seventh chapter entitled “The Regimen of Diet and Dietetics (Annapana-vidhi—annapānavidhi)” is completed.

The effects of Food (ashita) and Drink (pita)
3. The various kinds of wholesome nourishment taken by man, viz., eatables (ashita), drinks (pita), electuaries (Lidha—līḍha) and masticables (Khadita—khādita), on being well digested by the heat of the particular body-element concerned, whose strength is kept active by the inner gastric fire, imbue the entire body wherein the metabolic processes of all the body-elements are constantly going on like the process of time and wherein the circulation of the body-elements and the body-channels is unimpeded—with growth, strength, complexion, happiness and life, as well as replenish the body-elements. It is by being nourished with corresponding elements that the body elements are able to maintain the body in the normal condition.
4-(1). From the food ingested, there are formed assimilable nutritionfluid called the essential fluid and the excretory matter called the waste product. From this waste part are produced and fed sweat, urine, feces, the three excretory humors Vata, Pitta and Kapha, the excretions of the ear, eye, nose, mouth, hair-follicles and generative organs as well as the hairs of the head and beard, hairs of the body, and nails etc
The evolution of body-elements
4-(2). But from the essential fluid of food are produced and fed the body-nutrient fluid, blood, flesh, fat, bone, marrow semen and the vital essence, the material of the five sensory organs known as the essence of the body elements, as also such parts as body-joints, ligaments, mucin etc.
4-(3). All these body elements, both those known as effete products and those known as essential products being formed by the effete and the essential parts of body-juices according to the size and age of the body, maintain their normal proportions.
4-(4) In this way the essential and the waste fluids retaining their proper proportions keep up the balance of the elements in the normally constituted body which is their resort.
4-(5). When for some reason the body-elements belonging to the essential category have suffered decrease or increase, then the essential nutri-ent fluid by undergoing the required increase or decrease as the result of the food ingested, restores the balance of this group of elements, thus making for health. The waste fluid operates in the same manner on the body-elements belonging to the ‘waste’ category.
4. When the waste elements in the body have exceeded their normal proportions and require to be depleted, then being treated by the opposite qualities of cold or heat etc., they are found to return to normal, thus restoring the body balance
The function of Kitta, the excretory element
5-(1). Of these body-elements known as essential and waste products the body-channels constitute the means of passage. These channels feed the various body elements in the requisite measure and with the appropriate constituents.
The function of the nutrient fluid
5. In this manner, this body is the result of nourishment ingested in the four fold manner—eaten, drunk, licked up and masticated, and similarly the diseases that afflict this body are equally the result of food that is eaten drunk, licked up and masticated. It is the distinction between the use of wholesome diet and that of un-wholesome diet that is responsible for the distinction between health and disease in the body.
Agnivesha’s inquiry in this regard
6-(1). The worshipful Atreya having thus observed, Agnivesha said to him, “But O Worshipful One! we see that among those who make use of what is called the wholesome diet, there are the diseased and the healthy alike; so also among those who make use of what is called the unwholesome diet
6. Such being our observation how can we conclude that the difference of health and disease proceeds from the difference of wholesome and unwholesome dietary observance?”
Disease-factors other than unwholesome diet
7-(1). The worshipful Atreya answered, “O Agnivesha, among those who observe a wholesome diet no diseases arise which may be ascribed to such observance; but at the same time by the use of wholesome diet alone, all fear of diseases is not obviated since there are disease-inducing factors other than the use of the unwholesome diet. These are—seasonal abnormality, volitional transgression and the non-homologatory contact of sound, touch, sight, taste and smell.
7-(2). These three pathogenic factors serve to bring down disease even on a person who avails himself of nutrition in the right manner. Hence is it that even among the ranks of wholesome eaters there are persons afflicted with disease.
Absence of disease in spite of unwholesome diet
7-(3). Similarly if among the unwholesome eaters the dietetic offences do not produce immediate ill consequences, it is on account of certain other factors For not all dietetic errors are equally generative of morbidity nor is all morbidity of equal intensity nor yet again, are all constitutions equally capable of resisting disease. Thus for instance the same dietetic indiscretion when linked to aggravating factors of clime, season, combination, potency and dosage, becomes a much more serious offence.
Causes for the severity of disease
7-(4). Similarly, the same morbidity if arising from a multiplicity of factors if entailing mutually contradictory processes. if deep-seated if long-standing, if sprung from one of the ten resorts of life, or if affecting a vital part becomes the more formidable or the more fulminating.
7-(5). Constitutions that are very corpulent or very emaciated or composed of ill-formed flesh, blood and bone or debilitated or nourished on unwholesome diet, or of persons given to spare diet, or of feeble-minded persons are incapable of resisting disease. Constitutions of a contrary description are conversely capable of resisting disease.
7. It is from these diverse and varied factors of unwholesome diet and the nature of humoral morbidity and constitution that the diverse kinds of disease—mild, severe, of rapid or slow incubation—take their rise. It is again, O Agnivesha! in consequence of these etiological factors that the morbid humors Vata, Pitta and Kapha getting provoked in different sites of the body give rise to different kinds of disease
8.Now we shall delineate precisely in what particular sites what particular diseases arise as the result of the three humors getting vitiated in the different systems such as that of nutrient fluid etc.
9-10½. Disinclination for food, anorexia, disgeusia [dysguesia?], ageusia, nausea, heaviness, torpor, fever with bodyache, faintness, pallor, obstruction in the channels, impotency, asthenia, wasting of the body, loss of the gastric fire and premature formation of wrinkles and greying of hair—these are the diseases arising from the morbidity of the body-nutrient fluid.
Now will be described the diseases arising from morbidity in the blood. Dermatosis acute spreading affections, pimples, hemothermia, menorrhagia, inflammation of the rectum, phallus and the mouth, splenic disorders gulma, abscess, bluish black moles, jaundice, freckles, portwine marks, moles, ring-worm, abrasion of skin, leucoderma, papules, wheals and red circular patches these arise from the morbidity of the blood.
13-14J. Now listen to an enumeration of the diseases which arise from the morbidity of the flesh: granuloma, malignant tumor, piles warts, sloughing of the flesh, dry gangrene, adenoncus and deradenoncus—these are the diseases arising from morbid flesh.
15. We shall now describe the diseases arising from the morbidity of the fat. Their number is limited to the censurable conditions out of the premonitory symptoms of the anomalies of the urinary secretion.
16. Hypertrophy of the bones and teeth, atrophy and pain in the teeth and bones, discoloration and pathological conditions of the hair of the head, body and face, and, of nails are the diseases arising from the morbidity of the bones.
17. Pain in the joints, giddiness, fainting, faintness, and development of deep-seated wounds in the joints—these arise from the morbidity of the marrow.
18-19. From the morbidity affecting the seminal secretion a man becomes sterile or impotent; or else he begets diseased, impotent, short lived or deformed offspring. There is no likelihood of conception, or if conception takes place, it is soon aborted or miscarried. The vitiated condition of semen not only affects the man but extends to the woman and offspring.
20. When the humors get provoked in the seats of the sense-organs, they cause either the impairment or the irritation of the senses concerned.
21. The humors, when they become provoked in the muscles, vessels and tendons, afflict the man with stiffness, contraction, trachiocrural neuralgia, tumors, tremors or numbness.
22. When the humors get provoked in the excretory matter, they cause disruption, desiccation, vitiation as well as excessive retention or excessive discharge.
23. It is from the unwholesome nourishment imbibed variously by eating, drinking, licking and masticating, that the above-mentioned diseases arise in man.
24. Accordingly, in order to ensure the non-emergence of these diseases, the intelligent man should adhere to a strictly wholesome diet. Thus there will be no diseases that are due to dietetic error.
25. For diseases due to morbidity in the nutrient fluid, the lightening therapy in all its forms constitutes the remedy. As regards those diseases which are due to morbidity in the blood the cure has been set forth in the chapter on the blood-born diseases.
26. With reference to diseases arising from morbidity in the flesh, the treatment consists of purification, operative measures and cauterization by caustics and fire. As regards the treatment of diseases due to morbidity of the fat, the treatment has been laid down in the chapter on “The Eight Censured Persons”.
27. For diseases arising from morbidity located in the bones, the treat meat comprises of the quinary purificatory procedure and enemata, milks and ghees medicated with bitter drugs.
28. For diseases due to morbidity in the bonemarrow and semen, the treatment consists of diet which is predominantly sweet and bitter in taste, sexual congress, exercise and seasonal purgation in due dose.
29. The curative measures for diseases due to morbidity in the sense-organs will be laid down in the chapter on “The Vital Centres”: while the treatment for diseases due to morbicity in the tendons etc., will be set out in the chapter on “Diseases of Vata”.
33. In the chapter on “The non-suppression of natural urges”, a brief compendium of all therapeutic measures for diseases due to morbidity in the excretory substances of the body has been set forth. Treatment for the same diseases has also been indicated here and there.
31. By the use of physical exercise and by the acuteness of gastric fire or by failing to observe healthy regimen, the morbid elements spread from the alimentary tract to the peripheral region by the force of Vata.
32. They lie there quiescent as long as they are not actuated. As they are awaiting exciting causes, they do not manifest their morbid effects till they find the right place and time
33. By increase, by liquefaction or suppuration, by the opening up of the entrances of the circulatory channels and by retardation of Vata, the morbid elements leaving the peripheral region settle down in the central region.
34. With the double objective of the prevention of unborn diseases and the cure of those which have already arisen, the man desirous of happiness should observe the rules relating to the disease and its manifestation.
35. It is towards the goal of happiness that the entire activity of every creature is held to be directed. On account, however, of the divergent conditions of knowledge and ignorance there is seen divergence of the right and the wrong approaches to the goal of happiness.
36. The discerning, after full investigation, seek only what is wholesome, while the worldlings, their vision being obscured by passion and ignorance, run after anything that is pleasing.
37. To the discerning cleave lear ning, understanding, memory, skill resolution, wholesome living, purity of speech, tranquility and courage.
38. These qualities do not abide in the worldling, obscured in soul as he is with passion and ignorance. In consequence, many are the diseases both somatic and psychic that afflict such a man.
39-40. By reason of his defective judgement he is prone to indulge in unwholesome gratification of the five senses, to suppress the natural urges of the body and to commit rash acts. The ignorant man is attached to things that are pleasurable for the time being. The wise man being unobscured in his understanding takes no delight in such things.
41. Neither out of greed nor out of ignorance should one resort to dietary. Only after careful investigation should one eat what is wholesome, for the body is verily the product of the food one eats.
42. In the matter of diet there are eight factors which are regarded as being responsible for the healthy or diseased condition of the body. After carefully assessing these factors one should partake of food.
The wise man’s attitude
43. The wise man, by constantly avoiding all avoidable causes of diseases in the matter of diet, escapes blame at the hands of good people.
44. As regards those pathogenic factors which it is not possible for any one to avoid, it behoves the wise man not to lament on falling a victim to them.
Summary
Here are the recapitulatory verses:—
45.The body as the product of food, the disease born of food, the distinction of happiness and sorrow resulting from the distinction of wholesome and unwholesome diet;
46.the disparity in somatic and psychic resistance and want of resistance to diseases; the various groups of diseases. classified according to the morbidity in the various body-elements;
47. the remedial measures for these diseases; how the morbid humors get provoked, spreading from the central to the peripheral region or vice versa;
43. the difference between the wise and the ignorant man; what is wholesome for both the healthy and the ailing—all this has has been set forth in this chapter on “The Various kinds of food (ashita) and drink (pita)”.
28. Thus in the Section on General Principles in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the twentyeighth chapter entitled “The various kinds of Food and Drink (Ashita-Pita—vividha-āśita-pīta)” is completed.
7. Thus the quartet of chapters dealing with diet and dietetics is completed.
The ten vital regions
3. They say that ten are the resorts in the body wherein life is mainly centred. They are the two temples, the three vital parts (viz., the abdomen, the heart and the head), the throat, the blood the semen the vital essence and the rectum.
4. He who understands these ten resorts, the sense-organs, the intellect, the spirit and the diseases in all their aspects—that learned man alone, is said to be the saviour of life.
The Two kinds of Physicians
5. Of two kinds, O Agnivesha! are physicians. Saviours of life and destroyers of diseases are the one kind. The other kind are the votaries of diseases and destroyers of life.”
6. Unto the worshipful Atreya thus discoursing, Agnivesha said, “O, worshipful one! how are they to be recognised by us?”
The Characteristics of the Saviours of Life
7-(1). The worshipful one answered, “They are well-born, of wide learning, of wide practical experience, skilful, pure; practised of hand, self-controlled, fully equipped, with all the appurtenances of healing, in full possession of their faculties, conversant with the normal course of nature, able to take prompt and appropriate decisions—these are to be known as the saviours of life and destroyers of diseases.
7-(2). Indeed it is persons of such description that are never at fault with regard to their understanding of the entire body (anatomy), the growth and function of its parts (physiology) and its condition in health and disease (pathology). It is these again that are never perplexed in their understanding of the distinctions in etiological factors, premonitory symptoms, actual signs and symptoms, descriptions of pain and the homologatory signs i e. full clinical picture of the disease, in relation to the different classes of diseases easily curable, formidable, palliable and irremediable. It is these that are the exponents of the three departments of the science of life viz, etiology, symptomatology and therapeutics both in brief and in extenso, as well as of the three categories of drugs viz, animal, vegetable and mineral.
7-(3). It is these, moreover, that are conversant with the therapeutic use of the thirty-five rooters and fruiters, the four groups of the unctuous substances, the five kinds of common salts, the eight kinds of urines, the eight kinds of milk, the milks and the barks of the six plants, the group of drugs used in the quinary purificatory procedures viz., the errhines etc., the twenty-eight kinds of medicated gruels, the thirty-two varieties of powders and applications, the six-hundred purgatives and the five hundred decoctives.
7-(4). It is these, moreover, that are proficient in the science of personal hygiene as it relates to the rules of food and drink, standing, movements, lying down, posture, measure; articles of diet, eye-salves, smokes; nasal medication, inunction, cleansing, the non-suppression of natural urges and the suppression of evil impulses, physical exercise, the discrimination of what is agreeable to one’s system and sense-faculties and walking according to such discrimination in the path of right conduct.
7-(5). It is these, moreover, that are unbewildered in their understanding of the four basic factors of therapeutics, the sixteen qualities of these four factors, the differential diagnosis of diseases, as also of the three pursuits; of man and the salutary and unsalutary aspects of Vta.
7-(6). It is these, moreover, that are expert contrivers of the font kinds of oleation in conjunction with their twenty-four preparations and sixty-four-fold classification according to categories of taste.
7-(7). It is these, again, that are skilled in the application of various modes and methods of the drugs and precesses connected with the procedures of oleation, sudation, emesis and purgation.
7-(8-9). It is these, again that are conversant with the diseases of the head, the sum-total of the morbid conditions resulting from the various permutations and commutations of the three humors, together with the various kinds of wasting, inflammatory swelling and abscesses, the three kinds of edema, with diverse kinds of swelling that occur as sequele, with the forty-eight groups of diseases, with the sum of diseases numbering one hundred and forty arising from the discordance of one specific humor; similarly with the censured conditions of excessive corpulence and excessive emaciation, including their causation, symptoms and treatment, with wholesome and unwholesome sleep, sleeplessness and excessive sleep including their causation and treatment, with the six therapeutic procedures of lightening etc., with the disorders arising from repletion and depletion and alleviation, with the disorders' arising from vitiated blood, and with intoxication, fainting, and syncope including their causation description and remedial measures. Skilled likewise are these in the determination both of the rules of diet and of what food-stuffs are by nature most wholesome and unwholesome, what are foremost of their class, and of the eighty-four important kinds of wines; similarly in the determination of substances, properties and actions based on primary and secondary tastes of the several varieties of incompatible food-stuffs; in the matter of foods and drinks coming under the twelve categories including their properties and actions, as also the properties of corrigent drinks and their modifications due to nine factors; in the metabolic process as affected by the wholesome and unwholesome use of food, resulting in good and ill effects in diseases resulting from the morbid condition of body-elements including their remedies, and in the ten resorts of life- Skilled likewise are they in what I shall declare in the thirtieth chapter entitled “The Ten greatrooted arteries in the heart”, as also in the purpose and nature of the whole science and with regard to grasp, retention, understanding, application, endeavour, aim, time, agent and instruments as these bear upon the science of medicine.
7. Skilled, too, are they in imbuing themselves with the cultivation of memory, intelligence, theoretical and practical knowledge, with virtue and ability, and with cultivating good will for all creatures by behaving as their mother, father, brother and friend. It is such persons, O Agnivesha, that are the saviours of life and destroyers of diseases.
The Characteristics of Quacks
8. Opposed to these are the votaries of diseases and the destroyers of life. These charlatans in the robes of doctors, these thorns in the flesh of the whole world, with talents similar to those of mimes and mountebanks, move about in the land through the lack of vigilance in the rulers.
9-(1). Here is a detailed account of their character. Tricking themselves out in the height of medical fashion, they walk the streets with a view to picking up practice. Immediately on hearing that somebody is ill, they swoop down on him from all quarters, and in his hearing speak loudly of their medical attainments. If a doctor is already in attendance on him, they make repeated mention of his failings. They try to ingratiate themselves with the friends of the patient by suave manners, knowing whispers and officiousness. They make it known that they expect little by way of remuneration. On being entrusted with a case, they look about on all sides repeatedly trying to cloak their ignorance.
9. Finding themselves unable to check the course of the disease, they give it out that it. is the patient himself who is wanting in the necessary appurtenances, in attendants and in self-control. When they realise that the patient is at deaths door, they make themselves scarce and seek another neighbourhood. In the presence of uncultured people, they brag about their adroitness in the most unadroit manner, and like the ignoramuses that they are, they run down the learning of the savants. But if they sight a company of the learned, they slink away from a distance, like a roadster at the sight of a dark wood. If by any chance they happen to have conned a stray maxim, they constantly quote it in season and out of season. They can brook neither being questioned nor questioning others. They dread all questions as if they were the very devil. People such as these know not either teacher, disciple, co-student or disputant.
Avoidance of Quacks
Here are verses again—
10-11 Those who, putting on the garb of physicians, thus, gull their patients just as the bird-catchers in the forest gull the birds by camouflaging themselves in nests, such persons, devoid of the knowledge of healing both theoretical and practical, of time and of measure, are to be shunned, for they are the messengers of death on earth.
12. The discriminating patient should avoid these unlettered laureates who put on the airs of physicians for the sake of a living; they are like serpents that have gorged on air.
The Excellent Physician
13. But salutations be constantly proffered to those others who are learned in the science, skilful, pure, expert in performance, practised of hand and self-controlled.
Summary
Here is the recapitulatory verse—
14. In this chapter on “The ten resorts of life”, there have been set forth a summary of the contents of the section on general principles, the two kinds of physicians and the resorts of life.
29. Thus, in the Section on General Principles in the treatise complied by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka the twenty-ninth chapter entitled “The Ten Resorts of Life (Dasha-Prana-Ayatana—daśa-praṇa-āyatana)” is completed.
The Synonyms for ‘The heart’
3. In the heart (artha) the ten great-rooted arteries (dasha-mahamula) bearing, great fruits (Mahaphala—mahāphala) are well-embedded. The great or Mahat and the Cardia or Artha are the two equivalent terms by which the heart is spoken of by the learned.
The Importance of the heart as source of arteries
4. The body with its six limbs, the understanding, the senses, the five sense-objects, the spirit with its attributes, the mind and the mental concept, are all dependent on the heart
5. The heart is regarded by the cardiologists as the support of all these above mentioned factors, even as the central pole is of the thatchwork of a wigwam.
6. If it is but slightly injured, one falls into a swoon; if seriously injured, death follows. This is so because sensation which is otherwise called animation is based on it.
7. Further, it is the seat of the supreme vital essence; in it, too, is the seat of the consciousness. Therefore is the heart called the Mahat and Artha by the physicians.
The Arteries are the Ten Great Roots
8. By virtue of having this great organ as their root, the ten main arteries are spoken of as the great-rooted ones (mahamula). Carrying the vital essence, they spread through the whole length and breadth of the body.
The actions of the vital essence and the definition of vein, artery and vessel
9-12. They are styled the great fruiters because they have for their fruit as it were that vital essence (ojas) whereby all the embodied creatures subsist, being nourished; that in whose absence the life of all beings would cease to be; that which is the primary essence of the embryo,. that which is the quintessence of the fetal life, that which first enters the embryonic heart as it begins to develop; that on whose destruction the destruction of the organism ensues; that which is the support stationed in the heart; that which is the unctuous element of the body-fluid and that wherein the life-breaths are established, Or, it may be, the arteries are so styled, because they fruition in great many ways. They are called (Dhamanya) arteries because they pulsate, (srotānsi [srotāṃsi—srotas]) channels because they convey the essential juices and (sirāḥ [sirāḥ—sirā]) vessels because they conduct the blood etc., from one place to another.
Things to be practised and avoided in the protection of the heart etc.
13. He who wishes to protect front harm that great organ, the heart, those great-rooted ones (mahamula), the channels, and the vital essence, should scrupulously avoid all that causes affliction to the mind.
14. Moreover, he should have diligent recourse to whatever is good for the heart, good for the vital essence, and is purificatory of the vessels. Similarly, he should have recourse to quiet and wisdom.
[Chapter 30b. Definition of Ayurveda]
The foremost of the promoters of life etc.
15-(1). Now there is one that is the foremost among those that are promotive of life, one that is the foremost among those that are pro-motive of strength, one that is the foremost among those that are roborant, one among those that are joy-giving, one among those that are inspiriting and one among those that lead upwards.
15. Among these, non-violence is the foremost: among those that promote the life of creatures, virility amongst strength-givers, knowledge among roborants, the conquest of the senses among joy-givers, the understanding of truth among inspiritors, Brahmacarya among the ways that lead upwards. Thus do the knowers of the Science of Life (Ayurveda—āyurveda or Tantra) believe.
16-(1). Now, the knowers of the Science of Life (ayurveda) are to be regarded as those who are able to give an exposition of the system the sections thereof, the chapters comprising each section and the topics occurring in each chapter, in all the three ways viz., verbatim, with comment and with detailed elucidations.
The Nature of the Knowers of Science of Life (ayurveda)
16. The question arises: how is the system and the rest expounded verbatim, or with comment or with detailed elucidation?
The Verbatim delivery of the treatise
17. To this the answer is: when a system promulgated by a seer is recited in its entirety and in the order of its original enunciation, then it is said to be delivered verbatim.
18, When, having penetrated into the truth of its meaning by means of the understanding, a system is propounded in words that are elaborate or succint as the occasion may demand by the method of proposition, reason, analogy, application and conclusion, and in manner that is intelligible and appealing to the three types of student-mind, then it constitutes an exposition of the system with comment
19. When the difficult passages occurring in the treatise are elucidated by further glosses, then the exposition is called a detailed elucidation.
The Questions regarding Life etc.
20. If inquirers happen to be pre sent, they may ask the following question:—Of the four Vedas Rik, Yajus, Saman and Atharvan. which is the Veda that the knower of the Science of Life (ayurveda) should teach? What is meant by Life? Wherefore is this system named the Science of Life (ayurveda)? What is the purpose of the Science of Life (ayurveda)? Is it eternal or transitory? How many aud what are its branches? By whom should this science be studied and with what objective?
Ayurveda, integral part of atharvaveda
21. Having been thus questioned, the physician should declare his allegiance to the Atharvaveda from among the four—Rik, Saman, Yajus and Atharvan, because the Veda of the Atharvans stands for medical treatment by advocating such measures as almsgiving, propitiatory rites, oblations, auspicious observances, sacrifices, regimen, penances, fasts and incantation; and treatment, of course, is always laid down with a view to benefiting life.
Synonyms for ‘life’
22.“Science” having been thus explained “Life” now conns up for definition. Here all such terms as “Life”, “The flow of consciousness”, “Animation” and “Support” have the same connotation.
The Definition of the ‘Science of Life’ (ayurveda)
23-(1). Now ‘The Science of Life’ (ayurveda) is that which makes life understood. How does it do this? It throws light on the following questions:—What is life as such? what is the happy life and What is not such! What constitutes the measure of life and what a departure from it? The science is so called because, in addition it imparts knowledge with regard to what substances, properties and actions are promotive of life and what are not so.
The Nature of the Happy life
23. As regards these substances, properties and actions, some of which are promotive of life and some not the instruction is given throughout the entire treatise.
24-(1) We have duly explained both here and in the first chapter as to what life is, judged by its characteristics.
24-(2). Now, the life of such a man is called happy as is not afflicted with either bodily or mental ailments, as is, in particular, endowed with youth, strength, virility, reputation, enterprise and boldness befitting his abilities, is actuated in his deeds by the combined urge of knowledge, science, the senses and the sense-objects, is possessed of multifarious and delightful amenities accruing from great wealth, all in which efforts are prosperous and who can plan as he likes. A life that is contrary to this is deemed unhappy.
24.The life of that man is said to be good who is a well-wisher of all creatures, who does not covet other peoples’ goods, who is a teller of truth, who is peace loving, who acts with deliberation, is not negligent, is devoted to the three ends viz., virtue, wealth and enjoyment without letting anyone end come into conflict with the other two, who is reverential to those who are worthy of reverence, who is of a scholarly, scientific and retiring disposition, partial to the company of elders, of well curbed passion, desire, anger, envy, pride and conceit, constantly given to charitable acts, devoted always to austerity, knowledge and quietude, endowed with spiritual insight, and who is one-minded, contemplative of the good in this world and the next and endowed with memory and understanding. That life which is of the opposite nature to this is said to be “not good”.
25-(1). The approaching end of a man’s life is presaged by the inexplicable and abnormal changes in his sensual pursuits, sense-faculties, mind, understanding and general behaviour.
25-(2). From these it can be predicted that he will revert to the original condition of the elements during that moment or that hour, or that day, or the next three or five, seven, ten or twelve days or the fortnight or the month or six months or the year as the case may be. Herein, the ‘original condition of elements the cessation of activity,’ ‘death,’ ‘transience’ and ‘stoppage’ are all equivalent terms. Thus has been shown the measure of life,
25. Where no such abnormal changes are present, the span of life, so far as the subject of prognosis is concerned, is indeterminable. In the science of life (ayurveda) in general, however, instruction is given concerning the expectancy of life on the basis of the body, the humoral habitus and special signs.
26. The utility of this science consists in the maintenance of health in the healthy and in the quieting of disorders in the ailing.
27-(1). This science of life (ayurveda) is declared to be eternal, because it has had no beginning, because it deals with tendencies that proceed innately from nature and because the nature of matter is eternal.
27-(2). For at no time was there a break either in the continuity of life or in the continuity of intelligence. The experience of life is perennial; and pleasure and pain along with their respective causative factors are beginningless on account of their interdependent connection. This forms the group of subjects dealt with by the Science of Life (ayurveda).
27-(3). Substances that are heavy or light, cold or hot, unctuous or dry etc., are increased and decreased by the use of like and unlike factors. Thus it has been stated that the heavy things are increased and the light decreased by the repeated use of heavy things and vice versa. This nature of things is eternal; so also is the innate property of substances like earth etc. There are, however, substances and properties of both kinds, eternal as well as non-eternal.
27-(4). For, at no time can it be said that the science of life (ayurveda) sprang into existence having been non-existent before, unless the dissemination of knowledge by means of receiving and imparting instruction be considered as creation of such knowledge. It is, indeed, in view of such dissemination by the channel of instruction, that some authorities have spoken of the rise of the Science of Life (ayurveda) at this or that time.
27-(6). As a matter of fact, however, the function of this science is innate in nature and owes nothing to artifice, as has been set out here and in the first chapter, being like heat in the fire or fluidity in the water.
27. It is also eternal by reason of the eternality of its laws, as for instance, the law that heavy things increase and light things decrease by the repeated use of heavy and light articles.
28. The branches of this science are eight. They are: (1) Medicine, (2) The science of the special diseases of the upper supraclavicular parts of the body viz., eye, ear, nose, mouth, throat etc., (3) Surgery, (4) Toxicology, (5) Psycho-therapy, (6) Pediatrics, (7) Rejuvenation and (8) Virilification.
29-(1). This science is to be studied by the Brahmanas, the Kshatriyas and the Vaishyas. By the Brahmanas with a view to benefiting all creatures, by the Kshatriyas as subserving their role of protectors and by the Vaishyas as a means of livelihood; and, in general, by all, with the object of attaining virue [virtue?], wealth and pleasure.
29-(2). Now whatever endeavour a practitioner of this science makes towards the relief of the ailments affecting those who walk in the path of righteousness, or those who propagate righteousness, or of such persons as his mother, father, brothers, relations and seniors, or in whatever measure he meditates on, expounds, or practises the spiritual truths enshrined in this science of life (ayurveda)—all that constitutes the higher virtue of his life.
29-(3). Again whatever store of wealth or patronage he is able to secure from his association with kings and merchant-princes with a view to ensuring for himself an easy and comfortable life or whatever relief from distress he himself is able to extend to those who have sought his protection—all this constitutes the wealth of his life.
29. Once again, whatever renown comes his way, acclaiming him as a sage, or as a saviour, or whatever honours and services he commands, or whatever measure of health he is able to confer on those whom he loves—all this constitutes the satisfaction of a medical man’s life. Thus, we have dealt with all the points raised without omitting anything.
30. Now a physician should be examined by another physician on eight topics viz., the system (tantra) and its interpretation, the main sections of the system and their interpretation, the chapters in each section and their interpretation, and the questions and their explanations; and thus, being examined, he should give his answers, leaving out nothing, by verbatim quotations, by explanations of the quotations, and by further elucidations of difficult parts of the explanations.
31. Now the words “Science of Life” (ayurveda), “The Medical Branch,” “The Lore,” “The Aphorisms,” “The Knowledge,” “The Scripture,” “The Semeiolgy” and “The System” (tantra) are all connotative of the same meaning.
32. The scope of the system (tantra) has been explained by definition of it, already. This scope being divided with reference to topics, is distributed under ten different heads, viz., (1) Anatomy, (2) Physiology, (3) Etiology, (4) Pathology, (5) Therapeutics, 6) Objectives (7) Climatology, (8) Physicians, (9) Pharmacology, and (10) Procedures. These topics are dealt with in the course of the entire treatise
33. This system (tantra or ayurveda) has eight sections. They are the sections of (1) General Principles, (2) Pathology, (3) Specific Determination, (4) Human Embodiment, (5) Sensorial Prognosis, (6) Therapeutics, (7) Pharmaceutics and (8) Success in Treatment.
Here is a verse again—
34. Two of thirty chapters each, three of twelve chapters each and three again of eight chapters each; thus in these dealing respectively with General Principles, Therapeutics, Success in Treatment, Pathology, Specific Deter ruination and Human Embodiment has been enshrined the whole of this treatise.
35. The scope of each system of this section will be described in its proper place. Here listen to the enumeration of the names of 120 chapters in the order of their occurrence.

44. The drugs, healthful living, specific instructions, procedures, nosology and therapeutic applications—these six tetrads have each been treated in four consecutive lessons. The seventh topic is that which relates to food and drink. This has been treated in the next tetrad of lessons.
45. The last dyad of synoptical chapters complete the tale of thirty chapters full of significance. This auspicious divison forms is it were the very head of the compilation
46. In this division has been collected together group of tetrads, each of weighty import. This division has been called Shloka-sthana [ślokasthāna] in consequence of its contents having been generally presented in shlokas [ślokas] or verses.

68. In the respective sections, as also in the respective chapters, the topic of each chapter will be described. All topics, in their entirety will be spoken of, in their respective places, together with a summary at the end of each chapter.
69-71. A query which is taken verbatim from the treatise and is put in the conventional manner is called a formal question. To propound such a question by adducing reason and citation from the text is called the exposition of the question. A system (Tantra) is so called because it systematises, a section (Sthāna) because therein a particular thesis is established, a chapter because it deals predominantly with a given subject. Thus is the nomenclature derived. The octad (of system, subject matter of the system, thesis, subject matter of thesis, discourse, subject matter of the discourse, question and the exposition of the question) has been set out in entirety, agreeably to the question put. Likewise a complete and well-reasoned summary of this science has been given out here-
72. The verbal fights of Sciolists [Scholists?] create commotion like the sudden and alarmist flights of quails
73. Accordingly, before settling down to a discussion with them, they should be confronted with the eight-pointed questionnaire in order to gauge the extent of their learning; for therein is the forte of the learned.
74. The men of little learning—the weaklings—are put into a flutter by the very sounds of the medical scriptures, like a bevy of quails at the mere sound of the bow-string.
75. Sometimes an animal (which is not a wolf) taking advantage of the weakness of others of its kind plays the wolf; meeting, however, with a real wolf, the creature reverts to its true nature.
76. In the same manner an ignoramus given to blatant displays, establishes himself as an exponent in the midst of others who are equally ignorant; meeting, however, with a true exponent he is non-plussed.
77. The ignoramus possessed of little learning (but full of pretensions) is like a pole-cat hidden in its own bristles; what can such a one, comparable to a low born idiot, say in debate?
78. The physician should not engage in dispute with godly men, though they be of little learning, with a view to discomfit them; but one should not scruple to demolish by means of the eight-membered questionnaire, the others who pose as experts.
79. The pretentious and obstreperous wiseacres are generally given to much and loose talk. The godly are generally fair-spoken and are circumspect and. of few words.
80. One should not suffer disputants who are of little learning, foolish and blatant, not because of considerations to oneself, but with a view to keeping the light of knowledge unobscured.
81. Those whose compassion to all creatures is great and who are devoted to truth are ever zealous in putting down false doctrines.
82. Those who are adherents of false dogmas, in debate take recourse to such shifts as the inadequacy of time at their disposal, sudden indisposition, parading (of books and medical paraphernalia) and (in the last resort) to abusive speech; failing to gain credibility for their statements they tend generally to run down the opponent.
83. One should shun such revilers of the (true) scriptures as if they were the very snare of Time, the destroyer. On the other hand, one should sedulously resort to the best of physicians who are full of tranquility, understanding and scientific lore.
84. The whole of suffering which cleaves to mind and body has ignorance for its basis and conversely all happiness is founded in clear scientific knowledge.
85. However this very knowledge of mighty import is no illumination to those who are devoid of understanding, as is the orb of the sun to those who have lost their eye-sight.
Here are the recapitulatory verses:—
86. The ten great-rooted vessels (dasha-mahamula) in the heart (artha); wherefore they are so designated; the six fore-most of their kind, ending with the path of salvation; the description of those who are learned in the science of medicine;
87. the seven-membered and the eight-membered catechisms together with their answers; how they are to be made use of and for what purpose; and the six kinds of pretenders
88. All this has been set forth in this chapter entitled “The Ten Great-rooted Arteries.” This chapter is in the nature of a brief compendium of the whole of this treatise.
89. Just as a thread is used to string flowers together, so has this abstract been compiled by the sage for stringing together the various topics.
90. In the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, at this point ends the whole of the Section on General Principles.
39. Thus, in the Section on General Principles of the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the thirtieth chapter entitled “The Ten Great-rooted Arteries (Dasha-mahamula—daśa-mahāmūla)” is completed.
Synonyms for Etiology and The threefold nature of Etiology
3 In this science the terms Hetu (cause), Nimitta (instrumental cause), Ayatana [āyatana] (source), Karta [kartā] (agent), Karana [kāraṇa] (cause), Pratyaya (factor), Samutthana [samutthāna] (origin), and Nidana [nidāna] (primary cause), are used as synonyms. That (Nidāna or the cause) is of three kinds:—viz., (1) unwholesome inter-action between the senses and sense-objects, (2) volitional transgression, and (3) time-effect.
The Varieties of Disease
4. From these three causes, three kinds of somatic diseases arise: of the Pitta type, the Kapha type aud of the Vata type. There are the Psychic diseases which are of two kinds—those caused by Rajas (passion) and those by Tamas (ignorance)
Synonyms for Disease
5. Now the words Vyadhi (vyādhi—affliction), Amaya (āmaya—Sickness) Gada (illness), Atanka (ātaṅka—Malady), Yakshma (yakṣmā—Syndrome) Jvara (Fever), Vikara (vikāra—morbidity) and Roga (ailment) are all synonymous.
The Means to understand Disease
6.The knowledge of disease is obtained by the study of (1) etiology, (2) premonitory symptoms, (3) signs and symptoms, (4) homologatory signs and (5) pathogenesis.
The Definition of Etiology
7. Among these, etiology has already been defined as the causative factor of disease.
The Definition of premonitory symptoms
8. The premonitory symptoms are those that precede the actual manifestation of disease.
The Definition and synonyms of “Symptoms”
9. The symptoms are characteristic manifestations which develop during the course of the disease Here Linga (liṅga—signs), Akriti (ākṛti—form). Lakshana (lakṣaṇa—characteristics), Cihna (indication), Samsthana (saṃsthāna—shape), Vyanjana(manifestation) and Rupa (rūpa—signs and symptoms) are synonymous.
The Definition of the therapeutic Test
10. The homologatory signs are those which indicate what kinds of medicine. food and behaviour are antagonistic directly or in effect to dis ease and its causative factors and what are agreeable to the patient’s system
The Definition of Pathogenesis
11. Pathogenesis is known as the origination or the progress of diseases.
The Peculiar nature of each of them
12-(1). Pathogenesis is again classified according to number predominant morbid humor mode of classification, minutia and period of exacerbation.
12-(2). Now ‘number’ is as follows:—Eight kinds of Fever (jvara) five kinds of Gulma, seven varieties of Dermatosis and so on.
12-(3). The predominance of morbid humors is described in terms of the comparative and superlative degrees. The comparative is used with reference to two and with reference to all the three, the superlative is used
12-(4). Mode of classification means classification of diseases into.two groups, viz., endogenous and exogenous; in three groups according to discordant humors, and into four groups when classified as curable, incurable mild aud acute-
12-(5). “Minutia” in this context is used to signify precise minute pathological changes of each of the morbid humors.
12. The period of exacerbation of a disease is again determined by the nature of season, day, night food and time effect.
13. Therefore the physician who is of sound mind and understanding should know accurately the diseases from the view-points of etiology, symptomatology etc.
14. Thus a summary of the object of the Section on Pathology has been stated. We shall now once again expound the same subject in full detail
The Diseases to be described in this Section
15 At the very outset we shall expound in due order, the pathology (nidana) of the eight diseases bora primarily of greed, intense malice and anger, and only a brief account of therapeutics shall be given here. Later on in the Section on Therapeutics we shall describe all the diseases in their fully developed form.
Fever, foremost of diseases
16. From among all disorders, fever deserves to be described first it being the foremost of all somatic diseases
The Eight factors of Fever (jvara)
17. Now, indeed fever (jvara) appears in the human body owing to eight factors They are Vata, Pitta, Kapha Vata cum-Pitta, Vata-cum-Kapha, and Vata, Pitta aud Kapha combined, the exogenous one being the eighth cause.
The Etiology, onset and signs and symptoms of Vata fever
18.We shall expound the characteristics of etiology, premonitory symptoms, homologatory signs and pathogenesis.
19. The Vata becomes provoked by excessive indulgence in dry, light and cold articles by overuse of emesis, purgation, enemata and errhines and by excessive exercise, by suppression of natural urges, fasting, trauma, sexual indulgence, anxiety, grief, depletion of blood, waking and faulty posturing.
29. When the Vata is provoked, it enters the stomach and mixing with the gastric heat, follows the course of the nutrient fluid—the final product of the food ingested, and constricts the channels carrying the nutrient fluid and sweat., and impairing the gastric fire and expelling it outwards from the seat of digestion, carries it all over the body; then, there occurs the manifestation of pyrexia, i.e. the rise of temperature.
21-(1). Then the following symptoms appear viz. the irregular onset and decline of fever, uneven pyrexia, varyingly acute or mild conditions of the fever (jvara), onset or exacerbation of fever at the end of digestion, day, night and summer season, mostly rough and dusky-red appearance of nails, eyes, urine, feces and skin, and excessive retention of feces and urine, fixed and flying pains of various kinds occurring in different parts of the body, assume various forms.
21. They are:—numbness in the feet, cramps in the calf-muscles, breaking of the entire knee-joints; aching of the thigh, breaking, boring, grinding, griping, crepitating, constricting and bursting pains in the waist, sides, back, shoulders, arms, shoulder-blades and the chest; difficulty of the movement of jaws; noises in the ears; piercing pain in the temples; astringent taste in the mouth; disgeusia; dryness of mouth, palate and throat; thirst; cardiac spasm; dry vomit; dry cough; suppression of sneezing and eructations; aversion for all tastes and salivation; inappetence and indigestion; depression, yawning, -flexion of the body, tremors, exhaustion, giddiness, delirium, insomnia, horripilation and setting the teeth on edge; craving for hot things; nonhomologation to the causative factors of disease and homologation to what is antagonistic to the etiological factors. These are the symptoms of fever due to Vata.
The Etiology of Pitta fever (jvara)
22. The Pitta becomes provoked by the excessive indulgence in hot, acid, salt, alkaline and pungent articles and by predigestion-meals as also by exposure to severe sun, heat of fire or by over-work, anger or promiscuous diet.
23. When the provoked Pitta, liberating the heat from the stomach enters the circulation by following the course of the nutrient fill’d the final product of the food ingested, obstructs the capillaries and ducts carrying the nutrient fluid and sweat, impairs the gastric fire by its fluidity, and expelling the heat out of the thermogenic seat in the body and squeezing it, carries it with itself all over the body, there is the manifestation of pyrexia the rise of body-temperature under the condition.
24. These are its symptoms, viz., onset and increase of temperature in the entire body at the same time; the fever (jvara) specially rises during the period of digestion, the middle of the day, or midnight or in autumn; pungent taste in the throat, lips and the palate; thirst; intoxication; giddiness; fainting; bilious vomiting; diarrhea; aversion to food; asthenia; depression of spirits; delirium and eruptions of red spots on the body; green, or yellow tinge of nails eyes, face, urine feces and skin; acute hyper pyrexia; excessive burning; craving for cold things: the non-homologation to causative factors and homologation to things antagonistic to etiological factors. These are the symptoms of fever of the Pitta type.
25. Kapha becomes provoked by excessive indulgence in unctuous, heavy, sweet, viscous, cold, acid and salt things, day-sleeping and merriment and by lack of exercise.
The Etiology etc., of Kapha fever
26. When this provoked Kapha entering the stomach and becoming mixed with the gastric heat, enters the circulation by following the course of the fluid called the nutrient fluid, the final product of the food ingested; it then obstructs the capillaries and ducts carrying the nutrient fluid and sweat; then impairing and expelling the heat from the thermogenic seat and sqeezing [squeezing?] it, spreads it in the entire body. Then occurs the manifestation of pyrexia.
27. These are its symptoms viz., the onset and increase of temperature in the whole body at the same time; occurrence, of fever (jvara), specially just after meals, in the forenoon, in the early part of the night and in the spring; heaviness of the limbs, anorexia increase of mucus-secretion, sweet taste in the mouth nausea, excessive mucus-secretion in the stomach, stillness, vomiting, weakness of the digestive fire, hypersomnia, rigidity, torpor, cough, dyspnea, coryza, coldness and pallor of the nails, eyes, face, urine, feces and skin, frequent appearance of a multiplicity of cold pimples over the body, craving for hot things and non-homologation to causative factors and homologation to what is antagonistic to etiological factors. These are the symptoms of the fever of the Kapha type.
The Etiology etc., of Bi-discordant and Tri-discordant fevers
28. By promiscuous diet, fasting, sudden change in diet, abnormal variations in the season, inhalation of unwholesome odors, the use of water which has been contaminated by toxins, by the use of poison, by habitation at the foot of mountains, by the abuse of the procedures of oleation, sudation, emesis, purgation, corrective and unctuous enemata and errhines, by wrongful regimen in rehabilitation-process, abnormal delivery, by faulty puerperal treatment of the accouchee or the concurrence according to the cirumstances of the etiological factors described above, any two or all of the three humors become provoked at one and the same time. Having thus become provoked, these humors acting in the manner already described, bring about pyrexia
29. Now by noting the distinctions in the several concurrent manifestations of the symptoms described above, the physician should be able to tell whether a given fever is due to this or that double-discordance or to tri-discordance.
The Four kinds of Exogenous fever
[The Four kinds of Exogenous fever and the Morbid conditions varying with the Difference in etiological factors]
30-(1). Resulting from trauma or the influence of evil spirits, witchcraft or imprecations, here is the eighth variety of fever (jvara) which is considered exogenous and which is characterised by the precedence of pain. This exogenous fever continues for some time with the manifestation of pyrexia only, and then becomes associated with the morbid humors.
30. Thus the fever (jvara) resulting from trauma is associated with morbid Vata due to vitiated condition of blood; the fever resulting from the influence of evil spirits is associated with the morbid Vata and Pitta, and the fever resulting from witch-craft and imprecations is associated with all the three morbid humors.
The Special nature of the Exogenous fever
31. This exogenous fever being distinct from the other seven types of fevers (jvara) which are endogenous in the matter of symptomatology, treatment and causation, is to be considered separately. It is to be treated by usual therapeutic measures as indicated. Thus has been described the eight-fold nature of fever.
Variety due to Etiologic factors
32. All fever is one, its pathognomic symptom being pyrexia. But it is spoken of as of two kinds, when considered in the light of craving for hot or cold things and according to the distinctions of endogenous and exogenous fevers. Of these two, the endogenous is said to be two, three, four or seven varieties by the physicians in accordance with the distinctive combination of the three humors, Vata etc.
The Premonitory symptoms of Fever
33. The following are the premonitory symptoms of fever (jvara), viz., dysgeusia, heaviness of limbs, inappetence, agitation of the eyes, lachrymation, hyper-somnia, seediness, yawning, flexion, tremors, fatigue, giddiness, talking at random, insomnia, horripilation and having the teeth, set on edge, transient like and dislike for sounds, cold, wind and the sun; anorexia and indigestion, debility, bodyaches, asthenia, low spirits, procrastination, indolence, avoidance of the usual course of routine, opposition to one’s own interests, disregard of the advice of elders, dislike for children, indifference to one’s duty, the feeling of infliction in wearing flower-garlands, in anointing oneself with unguents and in eating; repugnance for sweetmeats, fondness for sour, salt and pungent things—these are the premonitory symptoms of fever preceding the rise of temperature. They may continue during the entire course of fever.
Treatment of fever in brief
34. Thus the symptoms of fever (jvara) have been individually described in brief and in extenso.
35-(1). Fever is born of the Great God (Maheśvara [Maheśvara]). It is the destroyer of the life of all living beings, it heats up the body, senses and the mind. It is the diminisher of intelligence, strength, body-lustre, liveliness and enthusiasm, the inducer of fatigue, exhaustion, delusion and impairment of alimentation. Fever is so called because it causes the body to be fevered. There are no other diseases which are as fierce, as prolific of complications and as difficult of treatment as this one.
35.Fever (jvara) is the king of diseases. It is known by various appellations according to its manifestation in the body of the horizontally spined creatures. All living beings come into the world with fever on them and likewise with fever on them they die. It is the great delusion; enveloped by it, creatures do not recall any action done in their previous lives. It is fever alone that in the end takes away the life breaths of all living beings.
36. On the appearance of the premonitory symptoms or in the initial stage of fever (jvara), either light diet or starvation is indicated, seeing that fever originates from the seat of digestion. Thereafter (digestive and sedative) decoctions, inunctions, oleation, sudation, applications, affusions, unguents emetics, purgatives, corrective and unctuous enemata, sedatives, sternutatives; fumigations, inhalation, eye-salves and milk-diet should be availed of according to the nature of the fever and in proper manner.
37. In all kinds of chronic fevers the potion of ghee which has been prepared with suitable drugs is recommended. Being unctuous in its nature, ghee subdues Vata (which is dry). Being properly prepared, it subdues Kapha; and being cooling, it subdues both Pitta and heat. Therefore in all chronic fevers, ghee is beneficial as water is beneficial in the else of things that have caught fire.
Here are verses again—
38. Just as men pour water over a burning house with a view to quench the fire, go do they use ghee for quieting chronic fever (jvara).
39. By its unctuous property, it subdues Vata, by its cooling property it subdues Pitta; and ghee inspite of its being possessed of qualities similar to those of Kapha, subdues it when prepared with suitable drugs.
40. There is no other unctuous article which imbibes the quality of drugs to the extent that ghee does. Hence ghee is regarded as the best of all unctuous articles.
41. If a thing has been said already in prose and is again told in verse, it is for the sake of clarity and emphasis, Such repetition is not censurable.
Summary
Here are the recapitulatory verses—
42-44. The three varieties, the etiological factors and their Synonyms, the five-fold nature of disease, the synonyms of disease and of symptoms, of disease, the five factors leading to the full knowledge of disease, the eight varieties of fever, its remote and immediate causes, premonitory symptoms, signs and symptoms and treatment in brief—all this, has the teacher, Punarvasu Atreya, who was free from all ills, declared to the obedient Agnivesha in the first chapter on “The Pathology of Fever (jvara-nidana)”.
1. Thus, in the Section on Pathology in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the first chapter entitled “The Pathology of Fever” is completed.
The Etiology and Onset of Hemothermia
3. We shall explain the condition where Pitta (thermia) acquires the appellation of Hemothermia (raktapitta).
4-(1). If a person takes the diet mainly of barley, Uddalaka [uddālaka] or Koradusa [koradūṣa] corn and execessively hot and acute food mixed with Nishpava [niṣpāva], black gram, horse-gram, pigeon pea or alkali, or with curds whey, diluted whey, sour butter-milk, sour conjee or the flesh of hog. buffalo, sheep, fish and cow, or til paste or Pindalu [piṇḍālu] dried vegeta bles, or radish, white mustard, garlic indian beech, drumstick, sweet drumstick, Bhustrina [bhūstṛṇa], the varieties of basil called Sumukha Surasa, Kutheraka [kuṭheraka], Gandira [gaṇḍīra], Kalamalaka [kālamālaka] and Parnasa [parṇāsa], Kshavaka [kṣavaka] and Phanijjhaka [phaṇijjhaka] as chutneys, or wines called Sara [sarā], Sauviraka [sauvīraka], Tushodaka [tuṣodaka], Maireya, Medaka Madhulaka [madhūlaka], and vinegars or other sour postprandial potions made of jujube small and big or pasted articles of diet at the end of the meal, or if a person being afflicted with heat drinks raw milk in excess or too frequently or eats Rohini vegetable along with milk, or the flesh of Kana [kāṇa] pigeon [kāṇakapota] cooked in white-mustard oil and alkali or if a man being afflicted with heat, drinks milk along with horsegram, til paste, ripe jambool, Lakucha or jujube; the Pitta of such a person gets provoked and the blood exceeds its normal proportion causing plethora.
4. When under this condition of hyperemia, the provoked Pitta, while circulating in the body reaches the orifices of the splenic aud hepatic blood-carrying vessels which have become dilated, and gets obstructed, then indeed it causes vitiation of the blood.
Why Pitta is called Blood-pitta or hemothermia
5. Owing to its contact with the blood and its contaminating the blood and acquiring the smell and the tint of the blood, that Pitta is called Hemothermia (Lohita Pitta).
The Premomtory symptoms of hemothermia
6. These are its premonitory symptoms viz, inappetence, misdigestion of food eaten, eructations of sour taste aud of bad smell like that of vinegar, frequent urge for vomiting, offensiveness of the vomited matter, cacophonia, asthenia of limbs, burning all over the body, steaming emanations from the mouth, mouth smelling of metal, blood, fish or raw flesh; red, green or yellow color of body-limbs, feces, urine, sweat, saliva aud discharges of the nose, mouth, ear aud eye and of pimples on the body; body-aches and frequent visions of red blue, yellow, brown and shining forms in dreams.
Its Complications
7.The complications in this condition are debility, anorexia indigestion, dyspnea, cough, fever, diarrhea, edema, emaciation, anemia and cacophonia.
The Directions of its Spreading
8-(1). There are two directions, in which hemothermia (raktapitta) spreads: upwards and downwards. When there is great predominance of. Kapha in the body, the vitiated blood being carried upwards by combination with Kapha, flows out of the body through the ears, nose, mouth and eyes.
8-(2). In a body where Vata is greatly predominant, the vitiated blood is carried downwards by its combination with Vata and flows out of the body through the urinary or the fecal passages.
8. In a case where Kapha and Vata are both predominant, the vitiated blood flows in both the directions by its combination with Kapha and Vata. Thus, being carried in both the directions it flows out of all the orifices of the body above mentioned.
Curability and incurability
9. The condition which affects the upper part is curable because it admits of treatment by purgation and by a multiplicity of medications. That which affects the lower parts is palliable owing to the necessity of limiting the treatment to emesis only and to the paucity of medications. That condition which affects both the parts is incurable because of its not admitting of the use of either emesis or purgation and of the absence of suitable medications.
Primogenesis
10.The disorder of hemothermia (raktapitta) followed upon the fever afflicting the body of creatures whose life-breaths were heated up by the fire which poured from the auger of Rudra at the destruction of Daksha’s sacrifice of old.
Treatment in brief
11. One should immediately try to alleviate this very acute and fulminating disorder which spreads like the forest-fire, with due consideration to dosage, clime and season, by means of repletion or depletion procedures, by mild, sweet, cooling, bitter or astringent diet aud by unguents, affusions, baths applications and emesis etc. The treatment should be carried out with great care.
Why hemothermia of the upper direction is Curable
Here are verses again—
12. Hemothermia which spreads upwards is curable, owing to its admitting of treatment by purgation and by a multiplicity of medications.
13-14. Purgation is the sovereign remedy in the subjugation of Pitta and is not an inferior remedy in controlling Kapha which is its concomitant. Medications of the sweet category really make good vehicles. Hence Hemothermia which spreads upwards is considered curable.
Why hemothermia of the downward direction is Mitigable only
15. Hemothermia (raktapitta) that spreads downwards is only palliable owing to the necessity of limiting the treatment to emesis and due to the paucity of medications available.
16-17. Emesis, however, is not considered the best remedy in the dispelling of Pitta. It is considered an inferior remedy in the alleviation of Vata which is its concomitant; a.d astringent and bitter articles are not suitable vehicles. Hence hemothermia which spreads do vnwards is said to be only palliable.
Why hemothermia of both directions is incurable
18. Hemothermia which spreads in both the directions should be considered to be irremediable owing to reasons stated above.
19. For hemothermia (raktapitta) there is no method of purification which acts in both the opposite directions and the removal of morbidity in each channel is laid down as necessary in the treatment of Hemothermia (raktapitta) .
20-20½. Thus there is no method of its sedation. When the morbid humors are combined, sedation is considered the best treatment. Thus has been d escribed the three kinds of effects of hemothermia with special reference to the direction of its spreading.
How Diseases reach the stage of incurability
21-22. Here are the causes whereby some curable diseases do not get cured. Owing to the absence of an attendant and other accessories or the patient’s folly or the fault of the physician, or the absence of treatment, the curable stage of the disease gets past.
The symptoms of the incurable condition of hemothermia.
23-24. There remains only the incurable stage of disease, the curable and the palliable stages having gone by. The specific clinical knowledge of hemothermia (raktapitta) is described here. The blood which is black or blue or of the color of the rainbow and which imparts color to the cloth is the hemothermia of the incurable type.
25. That hemothermia (raktapitta) is considered impossible of cure wherin [wherein?] stinking blood flows out in excessive quantity, which is associated with all complications and where there is complete loss of strength and flesh.
26.That hemothermia is undoubtedly irremediable where the patient afflicted with hemothermia (raktapitta) sees red visions and red sky.
What should be done in Curable, Mitigable and Incurable conditions
27. It is this kind of incurable hemothermia (raktapitta) which should be abandoned and the palliable one should be palliated by some efforts; and the conscientious physician should cure the curable type of hemothermia by specific remedies.
Summary
Here are the two recapitulatory verses—
28-29. The cause, derivation of name and the premonitory symptoms, complications, the two directions in which the disease spreads according to the association of morbid humors, curability and otherwiseness along with their reasons—all these, Punarvasu who is free from delusion, passion, greed pride, intoxication and attachment, has declared here.
2. Thus, in the Section on Pathology in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the second chapter entitled “The Pathology of Hemothermia (raktapitta-nidana)” is completed.
The Enumeration of Gulma conditions
3. There are five kinds of Gulma viz., Vata Gulma, Pitta-Gulma, Kapha-Gulma, Gulma due to tridiscordance and Gulma due to the vitiated condition of the blood.
The Differential diagnosis
4 Agnivesha said to the worshipful Atreya who had spoken thus, “How, 9, worshipful one! are we to know the special characteristics of these five kinds of Gulma? A physician, though versed in the science of medicine, will not be able to alleviate diseases without the knowledge of their special characteristics.”
5 The worshipful Atreya said to him, “By means of a knowledge of the etiology, premonitory symptoms, characteristics, nature of the pains and homologatory signs, a special knowledge of Gulma is obtained, as also of other diseases. O, Agnivesha! listen to the description of the special characteristics of Gulma.
The Etiology/Onset and signs and symptoms of Vata-gulma.
6. When a person of Vata habitus, being emaciated by any of the emaciating conditions viz., fever, vomiting, purgation and diarrhea, takes Vata-provoking food or excessively cold things in abundance, or takes emesis and purgation without previously taking oleation, or tries to vomit forcibly without inclination for vomiting, or suppresses the generated urges of flatus, urine aud feces, or drinks fresh water in excess after a surfeit meal, or travels in extremely jolting carriages, or is give i to excessive indulgence in sex-act, exercise, wine or grief, or suffers injury or is given to an unhealthy degree of sitting, lying, standing aud walking, or if he undergoes any other kind of strain born of irregular or excessive physical exercise, as a consequence of such acts, the Vata gets into a provoked condition.
7-(1). Then the provoked Vata entering into the gastro-intestinal tract aud spreading there all over, gets •hardened and forms into a rounded shape owing to its dryness and gets localised either in the epigastric region or hypogastric region or in the lumbar and iliac regions or the umbilical region. There it creates colicky pain and various other kinds of swellings and gets localised as a rounded swelling. As it is a rounded swelling, it is called “Gulma.” It gets now inflated and again deflated. It is accompanied often with indeterminute, severe or slight pain due to the flightly characteristic of Vata and also with formication in the limbs with piercing breaking and throbbing pain; extension and contraction, anasthesia aud hyperasthesia and with disappearance and reappearance.
7. Then the patient feels pain, as though pricked by needles or pierced with spear. His temperature rises at the end of the day. His mouth gets parched up, his respiration gets oppressed and when the pain begins his hairs stand on end. Splenic disorders, meteorism, intestinal gurgling, misdigestion, misperistalsis, body-aches, pains in the sides of the neck, in the head and temples aud inguinal swelling appear as complications. The patient’s skin, nails, eyes, face, urine and feces become harsh and dark-red. He has no homologation to etiological factors but has homologation to things antagonistic to etiological factors. This is the Gulma of Vata type.
Causes for the Provocation of Pitta-cum-Vata
8. If a person emaciated by the afore-mentioned emaciating condition, takes articles of diet that are acid, salt, pungent, alkaline, hot and acute, or takes vinegar, stale wine, greens and acid fruits, or irritating vegetables, grain or flesh, pre-digestion-meals or too frequent meals or fakes emisis on a dehydrated stomach, or is given to long suppression of generated urges or excessive exposure to the wind and the sun—these provoke the Pitta along with the Vata
The Onset of the Pitta-gulma
9-(1). The Vata thus provoked getting accumulated in the upper part of the alimentary tract begets those peculiar pains which are mentioned in regard to the Gulma born of Vata. Pitta causes burning in the stomach, epigastric region, chest and throat.
9-(2). Afflicted thus with burning sensation, the patient suffers from acid and fuming eructations In the region of the Gulma, it causes burning sensation, pain, fumes, heat, sweat, softening, looseness, tenderness to touch and slight horripilation.
9. It causes the complications of fever, giddiness, burning, thirst, parching of the throat, palate and mouth, stupefaction aud loose stools. The skin, nails, eyes, face, urine aud feces become green or yellow There is non-homologation to the etiological factors and homologation to things antagonistic to etiological factors This is Gulma of Pitta type.
The Causes for the provocation of Vata-cum-Kapha
10.In due emaciated by the above mentioned factors, gormandizing, the eating of very unctuous, heavy, sweet and cold foods, of food made of pastes, sugarcane, milk til, black-gram and preparations made of gur, taking in excess immature curds or wine, the excessive use of the flesh of wet-land, aquatic and domestic animals, the suppression of natural urges, the excessive drinking of water after a surfeit meal, aud rude shaking of the body—these cause the provocation of Kapha along with Vata.
The onset and smyptoms of Kapha-Gulma
11-(1). The Vata thus provoked, accumulating in some part of the upper region of the alimentary tract, generates the various kinds of pain; which are described in the case of Gulma due to Vata. The Kapha of course gives birth to algid fever, anorexia, misdigestion, body-ache, horripilation, cardiac disorder, vomiting, somnolence, indolence, rigidity, heaviness and excessive heat of the head, as also fixity, heaviness, hardness and deep anasthesia.
11-(2). Similary, having increased, it causes the cough, dyspnea, coryza and consumption, and the pallor of skint nails, face, urine, and feces. It has non-homologation to the etiological factors, and homologation to things which are antagonistic to the etiological factors. This is the Gulma of Kapha type.
Gulma of the Tri-discordance type
12. Where there is a combination of etiological factors and manifestation of the symptoms of the discor dance of all the three humors the wise declare it to be the Gulma of tri-discordance type. Being characterised by contrariety in treatment, the Gulma of the tri-discordance type is considered irremediable.
Gulma due to Vitiated Blood
13-(1). The Gulma born of vitiated blood occurs only in women, and not in men, because of their peculiar feature of menstrual discharge from the uterus.
The onset and signs and symptoms of Blood-Gulma
13. Owing to her position of de pendence, ignorance, and continual occupation in service and duty, she restrains the natural urges of the body. Either just after abortion or mis-carriage, or just after delivery or during the menstrual period, if a woman takes Vataprovoking foods her Vata gets quickly provoked.
14-(1). In that provoked condition the Vata, entering the orifice of the uterus, obstructs the flow of the menstrual blood. Month by month the obstructed menses distends the uterine cavity.
14. The patient is subject to colicky pain, cough, diarrhea, vomiting, anorexia, misdigestion, body aches, somnolence indolence rigidity and excessive mucus-secretion, There appear milk in the breasts, dark shade on the breasts and the lips, excessive weariness in the eyes, fainting, nausea, longings, edema of the [feet?] slight horripilation of the abdomianl hair, dilatation of the uterine channel and also emanation of bad odor and discharge from the uterine channel. The Gulma pulsates as one whole rounded mass. Such a woman who has not conceived at all, the ignorant declare to be a pregnant woman.
The Premonitory symptoms of Gulma
15-(1). Here are the premonitory symptoms of the five kinds of gulma appearing before their actual manifestation.
15. They are—inappetence, anorexia, misdigestion, irregular gastric fire, burning sensation after meals, vomiting and eructations separately during the process of digestion without external causes, lack of urge for the discharge of flatus, urine and feces, or if the urge is generated there is fruitless effort at discharge or meagre discharge; colicky pain due to Vata, distension of abdomen, intestinal gurglings, horripilation, very round and scyballous stools, lack of hunger, debility and intolerance to full meal.
Treatment of Gulma in Brief
16-(1). Of all these varieties of Gulma, not one is born without the provocation of Vata.
16-(2). Of them, knowing the Gulma born of tri-discordance to be incurable, one should not undertake to treat it. The Gulma born of one morbid humor must be treated from the very beginning according to the requirements of that morbid humor. That of the double discordance must be treated on the usual line of treatment indicated.
16-(3). One may use any other remedies which are not considered antagonistic, and classifying the conditions into serious and mild, one should remedy the serious conditions first and then undertake the treatment of mild ones.
16-(4). In cases of emergency when the specific nature of the Gulma cannot be recognised, the physician should give the treatment for Vata-gulma. Oleation and sudation are curative of Vata. Then mild and unctuous purgation and enemata, and acid, salt and sweet tastes are to be skilfully administered.
16. When Vata is once controlled, the other accompanying disorders admit of being controlled with very little effort.
Here is a verse again—
17. The alleviation of Vata is to be systematically tried by all possible means in case of Gulma. If morbid Vata is subdued, though the other morbid humors are provoked, they become easily amenable to cure-
Summary
Here is the recapitulatory verse—
18. The number, cause, characteristics and premonitory symptoms and an aspect of the treatment, have all been shown in the Pathology of Gulma.
3. Thus, in the Section on Pathology in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the third chapter entitled, “The Pathology of Gulma” is completed.
The Number of the Urinary Disorders
3. Classified according to the provocation of the three humors, there are twenty disorders of the urinary secretion; while there are innumerable conditions where urine is affected secondarily. We shall now expound urinary disorders resulting from the provocation of the three humors.
Their pathology
4-(1). Here we shall describe the suppression or the incidence of the disease which occurs as a result of the variations in the etiological factors, intensity of morbid humors and susceptibility of the body-elements.
4. If these three factors, mainly the etiological factors etc., do not mutually associate or support, or if they do so after a long lapse of time, or in a very mild form, either there occurs no manifestation of the disease at all or the disease takes a long period to evolve, or appears in an ambulatory or abortive form. Under the contrary conditions, there occur contrary results. Thus are laid down the different causes of the modes of incidence or suppression of all diseases.
5-(1). These three special pathological conditions cause the rapid manifestation of the anomalies of urinary secretion (prameha) born of Kapha.
5-(2). They are the frequent aud excessive use of new rice (Hayānaka [hāyanaka]), Yavaka, Cinaka [cīnaka], Uddalaka [uddālaka], Naishadha [naiṣadha], Itkata [itkaṭa], Mukundaka, Mahavrihi [mahāvrīhi], Pramodaka, and Sugnndhaka grains.
5-(3). Similarly the use of new peas, black-gram and other pulses along with ghee, of the flesh of domestic, wetland and aquatic animals, of vegetables, til, til-paste, flour, milk-pudding, kedgeree, thickgruel and the preparations of sugarcane juice, or the frequent use of milk, fresh wine, unformed curds, or liquid, sweet and unripe articles.
5. Avoidance of cleanliness and exercise, indulgence in sleeping, lying and sedentary habits, aud whatever other factors are likely to increase Kapha, fat and urine—these are all special etiological factors.
6. The special morbific factor of the humor is excessive fluidity of Kapha (body-colloid).
7. The special features of susceptible body-elements are these—excessiveness and diminished viscousness of the adipose tissue, muscular tissue, body fluid, semen, blood, fat, marrow, lymph and the fluid which is called the vital essence.
The Kapha type of Disorders
8-(1). When these three special pathological conditions occur simultaneously in the body, the kapha becomes suddenly provoked It is the first to be provoked because it is already in excessive quantity. It being provoked quickly, spreads in the body owing to the flabbiness of the body. While circulating in the body, it first gets mixed with the adipose tissue, owing to pathological changes in the adipose tissue, viz., excessiveness and diminished viscousness and also owing to the great similarity of quality between the Kapha and the adipose tissue Combining with the adipose tissue, the Kapha vitiates it because the Kapha is already vitiated The vitiated Kapha by coupling with vitiated adipose tissue now comes in contact with body-fluid and muscular tissue owing to excessive increase of both of these in the body.
8. Owing to the vitiation of the muscular tissue, it causes putrefying and sloughing inflammatory swellings like (Śarāvikā) crateriform ulcer or carbuncle and such others occurring in this tissue on account of its morbific condition. Then further vitiating the body-fluid, it changes it into urine. Then reaching the orifices of the urinary channels from the kidneys and bladder which are dilated by the morbid fat and body-fluid, it then becomes localised there, and thus gives birth to the anomalies of urinary secretion (prameha). It gets firmly established within the system and may become incurable owing to occurrence of such pathological changes in the body.
9-(1). The body-fluid combined with the Kapha and the adipose tissue while being converted into urine on its entrance into the kidneys, acquires the following ten pathological characteristics of Kapha.
9. They are—whiteness, coldness, hardness, viscousness, transparency, unctuousness, heaviness, sweetness, denseness, clearness and slowness. Then it acquires a special name accompanied with the qualities of one or more of the other conditions by which it his been mainly modified.
Their names.
10. Thus we have ten varieties of urinary disorders in accordance with their special designations. They are—Udakameha or Hydruria, Ikshuvalikarasameha [ikṣuvālikārasameha] or Glycosuria, Sandrameha [sāndrameha] or Chyluria, Sandraprasadameha [sāndraprasādameha] or Belluria, Shuklameha [śuklameha] or Bacteriuria, Shukrameha [śukrameha] or Spermatuda, Shitameha [śītameha] or Phosphaturia, Sikatameha [sikatāmeha] or Graveluria, Shanairmeha [śanairmeha] or slow micturition, aud Alalameha [ālālameha] or Pyuria.
Their curability
11. These ten urinary disorders are curable due to their being seated in the adipose tissue which is of similar quality and also due to the predominance of Kapha and to the similarity in treatment.
The Ten varieties of Kapha type of urinary anomalies (prameha)
12. The following are the verses regarding the special characteristics of urinary disorders of Kapha type.
13. That person who passes urine that is clear, excessive in quantity, whitish, cool, odorless and watery owing to the provocation of Kapha, suffers from Hydruria
14. That person who passes urine which is exceedingly sweet, cool, slightly viscid, turbid and resembling the juice of sugarcane owing to the provocation of Kapha, suffers from Glycosuria.
15. That person whose urine gets thickened if kept overnight in a vessel owing to the provocation of Kapha, suffers from Chyluria.
16. That person, whose urine, if. kept overnight in a vessel, becomes. partly dense and partly clear owing to the provocation of Kapha, is said to be suffering from Belluria.
17. That person whose urine is white and appears as if mixed with flour and who suffers from frequent micturition owing to the provocation of Kapha is said to be suffering from Bacteriuria.
18. That person is said to be suffering from Spermaturia born of the provocation of Kapha, who frequently passes urine which is either semen-like in appearance or is mixed with semen.
19. That person is said to be suffering from Phosphaturia born of the provocation of Kapha, who passes a large quantity of urine which is exceedingly sweet and cold.
20. That person is to be known to suffer from Graveluria born of provoked Kapha, who passes along with urine, hard and small particles produced by the pathological condition of the urine.
21. That person is said to be suffering from Slow-micturition born of provoked Kapha, who passes urine little by little without any force, with difficulty and very slowly.
22. That person is said to be suffering from Pyuria born of provoked Kapha, whose urine appears to be. full of mucous threads and is slimy and viscid.
23. Thus, the ten anomalies of urinary secretion (prameha) caused by the provocation of Kapha, have been described.
The Pitta type of Disorders
24. In a man afflicted already with the above mentioned condition, the habitual use of hot, acid, salt, alkaline and pungeut articles, predigestion-meal, and similarly exposure to severe sunshine and fire, anxiety, overwork, anger and promiscuous diet cause immediate provocation of Pitta. This provoked Pitta, very soon, brings about the manifestation of the following six kinds of the urinary anomalies (prameha) by the same process as described above.
Their Names
25. These again acquire special designation according to the particular qualities of Pitta. They are—Ksharameha [kṣārameha], Kalameha [kālameha], Nilameha [nīlameha], Lohitameha, Manjishthameha [māñjiṣṭhameha] and Haridrameha [ hāridrameha].
26. They combine with the six qualities of Pitta as described above viz., alkaline quality, acidity, saltishness, pungency, smell of raw meat and heat.
Their Palliable nature
27 They are all only palliable owing to the proximity of the seat of the discordant humors, and that of the adipose tissue and owing to the antagonism involed in their treatment.
The signs and symptoms of Pitta type of disorders
28. Here are the foilwing verses regarding the special characteristics of the urinary disorders of Pitta type.
29. That person is said to be suffering from (Ksarameha) Alkalinuria, born of the excessive provocation of Pitta, who passes urine resembling alkali in smell, color, taste and touch,
30. That person is said to be suffering from (Kālameha) Melanuria, born of the excessive provocation of Pitta who passes soot-black and warm urine constantly.
31. That person is said to be suffering from (Nīlameha) Indigouria, born of the excessive provocation of Pitta, who passes urine of the color of the wings of blue Jay (Cāṣa [cāṣa—cāṣapakṣa]) bird aud which is acid.
32. That person is said to be suffering from (Lohitameha) Hematuria, born of the excessive provocation of Pitta whose urine smells like raw meat and which is saltish, warm and red.
33. That man is said to be suffering from (Māñjiṣthameha [māñjiṣthameha]) Hemoglobinuria born of the provocation of Pitta, who passes urine of the color of indian madder water, which is increased in quantity, and which smells like raw meat.
34. That person is said to be suffering from (Hāridrameha [hāridrameha]) Urobiliuuria born of the provocation of Pitta, whose prine is of the color of turmeric-water, and is pungent.
35. Thus have been described the six anomalies of urinary secretion (prameha) caused by the excessive provocation of Pitta.
The Vata type of Disorders
36 In a man afflicted with the above mentioned condition, the habitual use of astringent, pungent, bitter, dry, light and cold articles and over-indulgence in sex-act, exercise, emesis, purgation, enemata and errhines, suppression of natural urges, fasting, trauma, sun-heat, worry, grief, depletion of blood, walking and unwholesome postures of the body, cause immediate provocation of Vata.
37-(1). When the provoked Vata while circulating in such a body, carrying fat with it, goes to, the urinary channels, there occurs the condition of (Vasāmeha [vasāmeha]) Lipuria. When it carries marrow to the urinary organs. there occurs the condition of (Majjameha) Myelo-uria.
37-(2). When it carries the lymph to the urinary organs and causes the continual flow of urine, then owing to excessiveness of lymph and the expelling quality of Vata, there occurs markedly frequent urge for micturition, and retention of the residual urine. In such a condition, the man continuously discharges urine without any force like a mad elephant; this condition is exiled Hastimeha.
37. If Vata by its dry quality changes the vital essence which is naturally of sweet taste, into one of astringent taste and carries it to the urinary organs, then it causes the condition called (Madhumeha) Diabetes.
Their Etiology
38. Physicians consider these four types of urinary, disorders caused by Vata as incurable owing to their great urgency and the antagonism involved in the treatment.
Their Names
39. They too again as before, obtain special appellation according to the respective qualities of Vata. They are Lipuria, Myelo-uria, Hastimeha and Diabetes.
Their signs and symptoms
40. The following verses describe the special characteristics of the various urinary disorders of the Vata type.
41. That person is said to be suffering from incurable (Vasameha [vasāmeha]) Lipuria owing to the provoked Vata, who frequently passes urine mixed with fat or having the appearance of fat.
42. That person is said to be suffering from incurable (Majjameha) Myelo-uria born of the provoked Vata who passes frequently urine mixed with marrow.
43. That person is said to be suffering from incurable Hastimeha born of the provoked Vata, who continuously dribbles excessive amount s of urine like a mad elephant.
44, That person is said to be suffering from incurable (Madhumeha) Diabetes, born of the provoked Vata, who passes urine which is astringent and sweet in taste, yellowish-white in color and which is unctuous.
45. Thus have been described the four anomalies of urinary secretion (prameha) caused by the provocation of Vata.
46. Thus, the twenty anomalies of urinary secretion caused by the provocation of the three humors -have been described.
47-(1). These three provoked morbid humors during the course of the development of the urinary disorders manifest the following premonitory symptoms.
The Premonitory symptoms of Urinary anomalies (prameha)
47. They are: the matting of the hair, sweet taste in the mouth, numbness, and burning of hands and feet, dryness in the mouth palate and throat thirst, indolence, increased excrement in the body, increased discharge in the orifices of the body, thermalgia and numbness in the body, attraction of insects and ants to the body and urine, abnormalities in urine, smell like raw meat in the body, somnolence and continuous torpor.
Their Complications
48. The complications of the urinary disorders are: thirst, diarrhea, fever, burning, debility, anorexia, indigestion, putrefaction, sloughing, and inflammatory swelling such as dry gangrene, abscesses etc., due to the prolonged existence of the condition.
Their Treatment in Brief
49. The physician should treat these curable urinary anomalies by carrying out purificatory and sedative measures as required.
Susceptible Persons
Here are verses again—
50. Urinary disease quickly nestles into him who is a gormandizer and averse to cleauliness and exertion even as birds nestle into their nidal tree.
51. Then death in the garb of urinary disease catching hold of the person who is low-spirited, very corpulent, hyper-unctuous and gluttonous carries him away.
52. The person who takes only such food as is homologatory to the body-elements and also practises all other wholesome activities of life, enjoys happy life
Summary
Here are the recapitulatory verses—
53. The etiology of the special pathological factors in the evolution of the urinary disorders, the combination of the morbid humors and body-elements the various forms;
54. the ten urinary disorders of Kapha type, the six of Pitta type and the four types caused by the powerful Vata.
55. The classification of the curable and incurable, the premonitory symptoms, complications and the line of treatment—all these have been described in this chapter o a the Pathology of the Anomalies of Urinary Secretion.
4. Thus, in the Section on Pathology in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the fourth chapter entitled, “The Pathology of the Anomalies of the Urinary Secretion (prameha-nidana)” is completed.
The Pathology of Dermatosis in brief
3. These seven body-elements are the source of many varieties of dermatosis. These, having been thus brought about, manifest local signs, and afflict the entire body.
4-(1). Dermatosis (kushtha) is never born as a result of the provocation of one single humor only. Though the causative morbid humors are the same in all the dermatoses, yet they are differentiated by the minutia of provocation, the sequela and site, which produce the differences in their characteristic pain, color, shape effects, name and treatment.
Classification into Seven groups
4. They may be classified into seven kinds or eighteen kinds or innumerable varieties. When the morbidised humors are classified according to the various combinations, diseases too, fall into similar classifications except in the case of irremediable disorders. As the list of the varieties of disorders is too long to narrate, we shall content ourselves here with describing only seven main varieties of dermatoses.
5-(1). When Vata and other humors get provoked and vitiate the four body-elements such as skin etc,, if Vata is predominant, there results Kapala dermatosis (kushtha) and if Kapha is predominant Mandala dermatosis is the result. When both Vata, and Pitta are predominant, the Rishyajihva [ṛṣyajihva] type of dermatosis is the result. When Pitta and Kapha predominate the Pundarika [puṇḍarīka] dermatosis result;; when Kapha and Vata predominate, Sidhma dermatosis and when all the three humors equally predominate the Kakanaka [kākaṇaka] type of dermatosis is the result.
5. Thus these are the seven main types of dermatosisdermatosis (kushtha). When these combine in varying degrees, they cause various types of the disease.
6 Here we explain in short the pathology of all types of dermatosis (kushtha). Sudden changes from cold to heat without observing the rules of gradual change, and similarly sudden change from fasting to diet without observing the rules of gradual change, and taking constantly and excessively honey, treacle fish, Lakucha, radish, and Kakamaci [kākamācī], taking predigestion meals; also eating the Cilicima fish with milk and taking food made mainly of Hayanaka [hāyanaka], wild barley, Cinaka [cīnaka], Uddalaka [uddalaka] and commonmillet grains along with milk, curds, butter-milk, indian jujube, horse^gram,. black gram, linseed, safflower and unctuous articles. If having indulged excessively in these a person is addicted to excessive, sexual intercourse, excercise or grief, plunges suddenly into cold water or if he eats irritant food without, vomiting out the misdigested food or suppresses the urge for vomiting or indulges in excessive oleation, all the three humors get simultaneously provoked. The four body-elements such as skin etc,, become flabby. The provoked humors settling themselves in these vitiated body-elements and getting localised will vitiate them further and generate skin lesions.
The Premonitory Symptoms
7. These are the premonitory symptoms of these dermatoses viz., anhidrosis, hyper-hidrosis, hardness, extreme smoothness, discoloration, pruritus, pricking pain, anesthesia, all-round burning, hyperesthesia, horripilation, roughness, releasing of heat, thickening, edema and acute spreading affection frequently on the body, discharge in the various orifices of the body, excessive pain in case of suppurations, burns, bites, fractures, wounds and falls, and the putrefaction and non healing of even slight wounds.
The Kapha Dermatosis
8-(1). After this the dermic lesions make their appearance. These are the special characteristics regarding the nature of the pains, colors, shapes, effects and names. They are. dry, reddish and hard, unevenly spread have rough edges, are thin, slightly elevated externally, numbed as if paralysed, covered with bristling hair, afflicted with extreme piercing pain lighting, itching and burning, and have scanty purulent or serus discharge, are quickly ulcerating and infected with parasites and are dark-red in color like a piece of broken earthen-pot—such are to be known as Kapala [kapāla] dermatoses (Brythema group).
The Audumbara Dermatosis
8-(2). Those that are copper-colored, covered with copper-colored rough rows of hair, dense, have plenty of thick discharge of pus, blood and lymph, accompanied with itching moisture, sloughing, burning and suppuration, those that spread, appear and ulcerate quickly and are infected with afflicting parasites and are of the color of ripe gular fig-fruit, are to be known as Audumbara dermatoses (Acute inflammatory group).
The Mandala Dermatosis
8-(3). Those that are glossy, large, raised, smooth, stable and have swollen edges of whitish red shade covered with white rows of hair, with excessive thick white discharge, very moist, itchy and affected with parasites, sluggish in spreading, appearance and ulceration, and which are round in shape are to be known as Mandala [maṇḍala] dermatoses (Urticaria group).
The Rishyajihva Dermatosis
8-(4). Those that are rough, reddish -colored, dark brown at the edges and in the centre, with shades of blue, yellow and copper-color, that are quick in spreading and appearance, attended with slight itching, moisture, parasitic infection, much burning, ulceration, pricking pain,(suppuration), painful as if pierced by thorns, and are raised in the middle with thin edges, and are surrounded with round pimples, and are oval in shape like that of the deers tongue, are known as Rishyajihva [ṛṣyajihva] dermatoses.
The Pundarika Dermatosis
8-(5). Those that are of white and reddish shades, of red edges, are covered with red rows of hair and veins, are elevated have profuse and dense, sanguinous, purulent and serus discharge, are attended with itching parasitic infection, burning and suppuration and are quickly spreading, appearing and ulcerating and of the color of the petal of the pink lotus (Padma palāśa) are to be known as Pundarika [puṇḍarīka] dermatoses.
The Sidhma Dermatosis
8-(6). Those that are rough and reddish, those whose external margins are fissured and glossy at the centre, with red and white shades which are multiple, and attended with slight pain, itching and burning, and purulent and serus discharge, those that have small beginning and slight tendency to ulceration or parasitic infection, and are of yellow color like the bitter-gourd flower are to be known as Sidhma dermatoses Psoriasis group).
The Kakanaka Dermatosis
8 Those that are of the color of the grain of Kakanantika [kākaṇantikā] (Jequirity seeds) in the beginning, and later, acquiring the sinful characteristics of all the above kinds of dermatoses, develop the various colors of the varied kinds of dermatoses are to be known as Kakana [kākaṇa] dermatoses (Malignant lesions). These are incurable, while all the rest are curable.
Curability and Incurability
9. Of them the incurable ones can never change their nature of incurability. But those that are curable, pass beyond the stage of curability owing to faulty regimen. The curables are the six varieties leaving aside the Kakanaka variety. Either due to neglect of treatment or due to faulty regimen, being saturated with morbidity, they become incurable.
10-(1). Owing to neglect of even the curable condition of dermatoses, parasites bora of the skin, flesh, blood lymph, slough, softened tissue and sweat grow strong. They eat away the skin and other elements, and further vitiating the already morbidised humors, generate the following complications corresponding to the individual humors
10. The Vata causes dusky-red color, roughness, dryness, pain, dehydration, pricking sensation, tremor bristles, contraction, fatigue, rigidity, numbness, ulceration and fissures. The Pitta causes burning, sweat, softening. putrefaction discharge, suppuration and redness. The Kapha causes whiteness, coldness itching, stability, thickness, elevation, increase of secretion and excretion, and parasites which eat away the skin, flesh, blood, lymph, vessels, ten dons and cartilage.
Complications due to Parasites
11. It is in this condition that complications afflict the patient: such as—excessive discharge, ulceration of the part, sequestration of the body-parts, thirst, fever, diarrhea, burning, debility, anorexia and mis-digestion. Such a condition is to be regarded incurable.
Easy curability of disease in Early stages
12. The patient that thinks it is easily curable and neglects the disease in its early stages, will be found after a while to be as good as dead.
13. But he who treats well the disease from the very beginning or in its early stage attains happiness for long.
Their incurability at Late stages
14-15. Just as a plant when tender is easily cut down but demands great efforts in cutting when grown big, even so a disease when in its early stage is easily cured but when advanced, is cured with great difficulty or even becomes incurable.
Summary
Here is the recapitulatory verse—
16. The number, substances, morbific humors, causative factors, premonitory symptoms signs and symptoms and complications of dermatosis have been described severally in this chapter on“Dermatosis”.
5. Thus, in the Section on Pathology in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the fifth chapter entitled, “The Pathology of Dermatosis (kushtha-nidana)” is completed.
The Four resorts of Consumption (shosha)
3. There are four causes of con sumption They are—overstrain, suppression of natural urges, wasting and promiscuous diet
4-(1). We shall now further explain our observation that overstrain is the cause of consumption (shosha). When a man who is weak, engages in a trial of strength with a strong man or exercises with a mighty bow, or talks excessively or carries very heavy weights, or swims very long distances in water or resorts excessively to hard massage or striking with feet, or running over a very long course at full speed or gets injured or carries out any other form of exercise of a similar description either in a faulty or extravagant manner, then by the inordinate character of such activity his chest gets injured. The Vata spreads all over the injured area of the chest. Getting localised there, it gathers the Kapha which is in that region and vitiates the Pitta and then over-runs the whole system, upward, downward and sideways. That part of the morbid Vata which spreads in the body-joints produces in the patient yawning, bodyaches and fever; that part which has penetrated the upper part of the digestive tract, produces cardiac disorders and anorexia; that part which has reached the throat afflicts it and causes weakness of voice; that part which has spread to the channels that conduct the life-breaths (respiratory passage) causes dyspnea and coryza; and that part which has become localized in the head, afflicts the head. Thereafter, in consequence of the injuries to the chest, the abnormal movement of Vata and lesions in the throat, the patient is afflicted with a continuous cough. As a result of the constant coughing, the lungs being injured, the patient expectorates blood; and from the loss of blood thus occasioned, there results increasing debility.
Rash acts as Causative factor
4.Thus, these disorders, arising out of overstrain, afflict the man who has overstrained himself. Thereafter being persecuted by these afflictions which waste him away, he becomes gradually more and more emaciated. Therefore the intelligent man, having correctly estimates his own strength, should engage in such undertakings as are commensurate with it, since strength is the support of the body and the body is the basis for man.
Here is a verse again—
5. One should avoid all violent activity, carefully husbanding one’s vitality. For, it is while living that a man may enjoy the desired results of his action
Suppression of Natural urges as Factors
6-(1). We shall how expatiate on our statement that the suppression of natural urges is the cause of consumption (shosha). When a man having entered the presence of a king or that of his master or while sitting at the feet of the preceptor or in the company of gamblers, or else, in the society of gentle-folk or in the midst of women or travelling in all sorts of carriages—high and low, on account of fear, preoccupation, modesty or repugnance, represses the urges for voiding flatus, urine or feces, then by such suppression, the Vata in him becomes provoked. Then, having become thus irritated, it breaks loose, wandering up, down and sideways, driving forward Pitta and Kapha in its course. Thereafter, having distributed itself in the manner described previously, in the entire system, it gives rise to acute pains, either loosens the fecal matter or dries it up, afflicts the sides exceedingly, grinds down the shoulders, causes increased respiratory movement in the threat and chest, afflicts the head and induces cough, dyspnea, fever hoarseness and coryza.
6.Thereafter that man assailed by these debilitating afflictions, gets gradually more and more emaciated. Therefore the intelligent man should, specially devote himself to those endeavours which assure the well-being of the body. Verily the body is the support of the mans well-being, since the man is established in the body.
Here is a verse again—
7. Leaving even thing else, one should take care of the body; for in the absence of the body, there is the total extinction of all that characterises embodied beings
8-(1). We shall elaborate the statement already made that wasting brings about consumption (shosha). When a man has his heart afflicted excessively with grief and anxiety or is taken possession of by envy longing, fear or anger, or being lean is given to dry eats and drinks, or being of weak constitution abstains from food altogether, or eats sparingly, then under such circumstances, the vital essence abiding in the heart becomes diminished; and from its diminution the patient begins to waste away and if proper counter measures are not taken, develops consumption whose characteristics will hereafter be described.
8-(2). Or, when a man being excessively libidinous as result of over-eroticism, indulges in sex act inordinately, then by reason of such excessive indulgence, his seminal secretion becomes depleted. If even after such seminal depletion, his mind does not turn away from women, then, during the sexual act which he achieves by sheer extravagance of his desire, there is no flow of semen, his body having been totally drained of this vital fluid. Under such circumstances, the Vata forcing its entrance into the arteries of the man who is going through the movements of the sex act, ejaculates blood. Since there is no seminal fluid left in him, the blood, driven along willy-nilly by the Vata, flows out of the seminal ducts.
8-(3). In consequence of the depletion of the semen and the discharge of the blood, the joints become loosened, dryness is induced and the body is further weakened and the Vata becomes provoked. Being thus exacerbated, it (the Vāta) sweeps through the vacuous body, and arousing the Pitta and Kapha it dries up the flesh and blood, causes the flow of Kapha and Pitta, afflicts the sides, grinds down the shoulders and muffles the voice; precipitating the Kapha, it fills the head with Kapha; afflicting the joints, it causes body-aches as also anorexia and indigestion; and by reason of the precipitation of Pitta and Kapha aud of Vata, it gives rise to fever, cough, dyspnea, loss of voice and coryza. In consequence of the persistent cough, the lungs having become injured, the patient spits blood; and from the loss of blood thus occasioned, he becomes weak.
Loss of Body-elements as Factor
8. Thereafter, racked thus with these wasting disorders, the patient becomes gradually emaciated. Therefore, the intelligent man seeking to preserve the health of his body, should husband the semen. For, verily, the semen is the highest product of food.
Here is a verse again—
9. The highest stage to which food attains is the semen. Hence one should conserve one’s semen. Its dissipation results in manifold disorders or death.
10-(1). We shall now take up for detailed comment what we said concerning promiscuous diet being one of the causes of consumption (shosha) . When a man indulges in drinks and foods which are ingested in various ways—swallowing, chewing, eating, or licking, and which are promiscuous as regards their nature, mode of preparation, combination, quantum, clime, season, rilles of eating and homologation, then as a consequence of this, his Vata, Pitta and Kapha stiffer
derangement. Being deranged, they spread through the body and take up their positions obstructing the orifices oF the body-channels. Under such conditions whatever morsel of food a man takes, is for the most part turned into urine and feces, and no other body-element is formed in any measure. The victim of such a disorder lives on, however, sustained by the fecal matter. Accordingly, the fecal matter in the body of a man who is wasting away as also of men who are extremely thin and weak, is to be carefully maintained. In such a man deprived of proper nourishment, the morbid humors, draw ing strength from malnutrition and each giving rise to its own peculiar maladies, further emaciate the body.
10-(2). Thus the Vata brings in its wake colicky pain, body-aches, impairment of the throat, pain in the sides, crunching pains in the shoulders, loss of voice and coryza; the Pitta brings fever, diarrhea and internal burning; and the Kapha brings coryza,, heaviness of the head, anorexia and cough. Owing to the persistent cough the lungs having become damaged, the victim spits blood and in consequence of this loss of blood he becomes debilitated. In this manned the three morbid humors getting augmented as the result of unbalanced diet induce consumption (shosha), the king of diseases
Promiscuous diet as Factor
10.The sufferer afflicted with these emaciating conditions gradually wastes away. Therefore the intelligent man should take regular diet, paying heed to constitution, clime, season, rules of eating and homologation
Here is a verse again—
11. The intelligent man, observing the manifold formidable maladies arising from unbalanced diet, should be a wholesome eater, a moderate eater, a timely eater and a master of the appetites
Why it is called the King’s disease
12. Wrought upon by these four causes of consumptionconsumption (shosha) , the three morbid humors—Vata, Pitta aud Kapha, flare up. Thus roused, they waste the body by diverse kinds of afflictions. On account of its being the most formidable of all diseases, consumption is spoken of by physicians as the King of diseases: or it may have been called the ‘King’s disease’ because it was first seen in the Moon—the king of the stars.
The Premonitory symptoms
13. These are its premonitory, symptoms:—coryza, frequent sneezing, increased mucus-discharge, sweet taste in the mouth, inappetence, weariness at meal-times, constant fault-finding even where there are no faults or negligible faults especially in the matter of dinner service, water, food, soup, cakes, savouries and the caterers; nausea immediately after meals; vomiting fits during the progress of the meal, puffiness of the face and feet, anxious scrutiny of one’s hand, extreme pallor of the eyes, over anxiety to know the propor tion of one’s arms; concupiscence; general disgust for things; frightful appearance of the body; the repeated seeing in dreams of empty reservoirs and deserted villages, townships, cities and country-side or withered, burnt and denuded forests or of oneself coming in contact with chamelions, peacocks, monkeys, parrots, serpents, crows, owls etc., or riding or being drawn by dogs, camels, donkeys, and pigs and climbing mounds of hair,bones, ashes, chaff, aud embers. Such are the premonitory symptoms of consumption.
Signs of Curability and incurability
14. Thereafter appear the eleven pathognomic symptoms of the disease, They are—fullness of the head, cough, dyspnea, loss of voice, vomiting of mucus, expectoration of blood, pain in the sides, kneading pains. in the shoulders fever, diarrhea and anorexia.
15. Now, a patient who has not suffered a general loss of strength flesh and blood, who is strong and in whom the fatal symptoms have not appeared, even if he presents all the rest of the symptoms of consumption (shosha), is to be considered curable. A strong man, well nourished and able to tolerate the strength both of disease and of medicine, is to be regarded as a mild case although affected with all kinds of symptoms.
16. But the patient who is weak, and is greatly reduced in strength, flesh and blood, even if he presents but mild symptoms and no fatal prognosis, is to be considered as a case of severe type and a fatal prognosis, because he is unable to tolerate the force of disease aud medication. Such a patient should be considered incurable, for in no time, he will develop the fatal symptoms; and the fatal symptoms’ develop abruptly.
Summary
Here is the recapitulatory verse—
17. He who knows correctly the etiology, the symptoms and the premonitory symptoms of consumption is worthy of treating the king.
6. Thus, in the Section on Pathology, in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the sixth chapter entitled “The Pathology of Consumption (shosha-nidana)” is competed.
The Number of its Varieties
3 There are five kinds insanity (unmada). They are due respectively to Vata, Pitta, Kapha, to all the three humors combined and to extraneous causes.
Its Etiology and onset
4. Of these five, the four which arise from the morbidity of humors, develop most readily in men of the following description viz., the fainthearted, those suffering from mental shock, the humor-ridden, those who make use, in a manner forbidden by the dietetic rules, of improper dietary articles, which are unclean and ill-prepared; those who abuse the general rules of healthful living, as also those resorting to other kinds of wrongful bodily activity; those who are exceedingly wasted in body; those who are crazed with the severity of disease, or those whose minds have been im paired by the attacks of lust, anger, greed, excitement, fear, infatuation, fatigue, grief, anxiety, regret and the like, and also those that are injured by trauma. In such persons the mind, having been impaired and the understands g unsettled, the exacerbated humor, getting further provoked reaching the heart (the brain) and blocking the channels of sensory communication, brings about insanity (unmada).
Its Differential Diagnosis
5. Insanity (unmada) is to be known as the unsettled condition of the mind, understanding, consciousness, perception, memory, inclination, character behaviour and conduct.
Its Premonitory Symptoms
6. These are its premonitory symptoms—viz., feeling of voidness in the head, restlessness of the eyes, noises in the ears, hurried respiration, dribbling of the mouth, inappetence, anorexia, misdigestion, cardiac spasm, misplaced mental absorption, fatigue, infatuation and anxiety, constant horripilation, frequent pyrexia, intoxicated condition of the mind, pain in the upper half of the body, the appearance of the features presented in facial paralysis, and the frequent seeing in dreams of roving, moving, unstable and inauspicious forms, or oneself sitting mounted on the wheel of the oil-press, or being churned as it were by whirl-winds, or the sinking of oneself in whirlpools of tinged waters and the retraction of the eye-balls—these are the premonitory symptoms of the insanity (unmada) induced by the provocation of the morbid humors.
The Symptoms of Vata-type
7-(1). Immediately after these indications, insanity (unmada) manifests itself. The signs and symptoms of the different types of insanity are as follows:—constant wandering, meaningless jerking of the eyes, eye-brows, lips, shoulders, jaws, foreparts of the arms and feet and other body-parts; talking interminably and incoherently; the flowing of froth from the mouth, continuous and inopportune smiling, laughing, dancing, singing and placing on instruments; giving loud imitations of the sounds of the lute, flute, conch and cymbals of the left and the right hand, trying to ride on mounts not in vogue, adorning oneself with queer and un-ornamental objects; hankering after unobtainable viands, and actual contempt or extreme niggardliness for those in actual possession; emaciation and roughness of the body and swelling and redness of the eyes, nou-homologation to the things that are non-alleviative of Vata—these are the symptoms of insanity (unmada) of the Vata type.
The symptoms of Pitta type
7-(2). Irritability anger and excitement in the wrong place, striking oneself or others with weapons, brickbats, whips, sticks and with fists; running about; craving for shade, cold water and food; prolonged attacks of anguish; coppery, green, yellow and furious look of the eyes, and non homologation to the things that are non-alleviative of Pitta—these are the symptoms of the Pitta type of insanity (unmada).
The Symptoms of Kapha-type
7-(3). Being rooted to one spot, silence little disposition for movement dribbling of saliva or nasal discharge. disinclination for food, love of solitude, offensiveness, aversion to cleanliness, constant somnolence, edema of the face, whiteness, fixity and covering of mucus-discharge of the eyes and non-homologation to the things that are non-alleviative of Kapha—these are the symptoms of the Kapha type of insanity.
The Symptoms of Tri-discordance-type
7. That form of the insanity which manifests the symptoms of all the three morbid humors is to be known as the insanity of the tri-discordance-type. The experts declare that such insanity is incurable
Treatment of Curable types
8. Of the other three which are curable the following constitute the therapeutic measures:—oleation, sudation, emesis, purgation, corrective and unctuous enemata sedation, errhination inhalation, fumigation, eye-salves, nasal medications, insufflations inunctions, application, affusions, besmearing, shock-therapy, intimidating the patient with threat of death chaining and confinement, frightening, inducing astonishment and forgetful ness, depletion and venesection, skilful regimen of diet according to indication and other suitable measures antagonistic to the nature of etiological factors.
Here is a verse again—
9. The expert physician should treat the curable types of insanity (unmada) which are born of morbid humors, by the therapeutic method herein described.
The Etiology of the Exogenous type
10. That form of insanity (unmada), however, which presents causes, premonitory symptoms, symptoms, pain and homologation, other than those which arise from endogenous humoral discordance is said to be exogenous. Some would have it that such insanity owes its origin to reprehensible actions done in the former existence. The teacher, Atreya Punarvasu, however is of the opinion that in this case, too, the etiological factor is volitional transgression, that a man, by disregarding the gods, seers, manes. Gandharvas, Yakshas, demons, goblins, seniors, elders, adepts, preceptors and worthies, perpetrates undesirable acts or begins similar reprehensible undertakings. Assailing such a man who is mainly his own assailant, the gods and such others render him insane.
Its Premonitory Symptoms
11. The following are the premonitory symptoms seen in a man wao is heading towards the exogenous type of insanity (unmada), which comes of the displeasure of the gods etc; viz., a liking for causing hurt to the gods, cows, Brahmanas and the ascetics, irascibility, mischief-mongering, apathy, the impairment of the vital essence, complexion, lustre, strength and body, and in dreams being despised by the gods and others and being incited. Thereafter, there occurs the appearance of insanity.
12. The following is the manner in which the madness-inducing agencies operate, when wishing to afflict any one with madness. Thus the gods send down madness by a look, the teachers, elders, adepts and the great sages by a curse, the manes by revealing themselves, the Gandharvas by a touch the Yakshas by taking possession, the Rakshasas by letting their body-odors be sniffed, and lastly, the goblins by mounting their victims and riding them.
The Symptoms of insanity due to Evil Spirits
13. These are the symptoms the exogenous type of insanity (unmada), viz. super-human strength, energy capacity, prowess, grasp, retention, memory, understanding, speech and knowledge The time of manifestation of this type of insanity is indeterminate.
The Period of onset of the Exogenous insanity
14. The following are the junctures when men become liable to the malign influence of the gods sages, manes. Gandharvas, Yakshas, demons and goblins or of the preceptors: elders and adepts, desirous of inducing madness. They are—the commencement of any evil act, or at the time of fructification of former misdeeds while residing alone in a deserted house, or at the crossing of four roads, when failing to practise self-control during the twilights, during sexual congress, on the full and new moon days, while cohabiting with a menstruating woman, during any impropriety in the observance of scriptural recitation, offerings auspicious rites, and sacrifice on lapsing from discipline, vows and Brahmacarya, on the field of battle, at the destruction of a country, community or city during an eclipse, at the time of delivery for a woman, at the contact of various kinds of inauspicious and unclean objects, while vomiting, purging or bleeding, while visiting holy places and temples in an unclean or improper state, while in an uncleansed condition after eating flesh, honey, til, gur or wine, while in a state of rudeness, while traversing at night through a town, city, crossroads, park, cremation ground or a place of slaughter, while engaged in insulting the twice-born, the preceptors the gods, the ascetics and the venerable, while mispropounding the scriptures or during the performance of any other blame-worthy action; thus we have enumerated the specific times at which the seizure begins.
Curability and incurability of Exogenous types
15.As regards the motive in the it sanity-causing agents, for inducing insanity (unmada), it is threefold; viz., cruelty, lust and the extortion of worship. The incentive in each case is to be inferred from the difference in the behaviour of the victim, Thus for instance the man who is afflicted with madness by the gods etc., out of cruelty, will enter the fife or dive into the waters or fall from his position into a pit or strike himelf [himself?] with weapons or whips or resort to some other means for taking his life. Such sanity should be regarded as incurable. The other two where the incentive of the maddening agents, is lust or the desire for worship, are curable.
Its Treatment
16. In the case of these two the therapeutic measures consist of the following charms, herbs, magical stones, auspicious rites, oblations, offerings, sacrifices, ritual discipline (Niyama), vows, expiatory rites, fasts, blessings, obeisance to the gods and pilgrimages
17. Thus, we have dealt with the five kinds of insanity (unmada).
The mixed nature of their Symptoms
18. These five varieties, however, viewed either as endogenous and exogenous or as curable and incurable, reduce themselves into two groups Occasionally these two overlap, m consequence of the etiological factors of both types. In such cases, the premonitory symptoms are of a hybrid character and hybrid, too, are the actual symptoms. If the coalescence is between two incurable ones, them the malady is to be regarded as incurable. That only is curable where both types are curable. The treatment for this last mentioned group consists in combination of the remedial measures suitable for both.
Here are verses again—
Action in the Previous birth, the cause of Spirit-insanity
19. Neither gods, nor the Gandharvas, neither the goblins nor the demons, nor aught else, torment the man who is not tormented of himself.
20. Those who pursue their suffering victim by the compulsion of his misdeeds are not the authors of his sufferings; for they are not the authors of his actions.
21. The wise man when afflicted with disease which arises from volitional transgression aud is the result of one’s own action, should not rail against the gods, the manes, or the demons
The Need for Virtuous Conduct
22. But he should regard his very self as the author of his pain and pleasure. Accordingly he should search out what is good for himself and not allow himself to be fear-stricken.
23. Reverence for the gods, the use of wholesome things, as well as what is opposed to both these, are in the control of oneself.
Summary
Here is the recapitulatory verse -
24. The enumeration, the etiology, the premonitory symptoms, the actual symptoms, the curability and incurability and the methods of treatment are all set out in this chapter on the Pathology of the various forms of Insanity.
7. Thus in the Section on Pathology in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Cai aka, the seventh chapter entitled “The Pathology of Insanity (unmada-nidana)” is completed.
The Number of its Varieties
3. There are four kinds of epilepsy (apasmara), the Vata type, the Pitta type, the Kapha type and the tri-discordance type.
Etiology and onset
4-(1). These four kinds of epilepsy (apasmara) develop rapidly in subjects of the following description:—Those whose minds are obscured by passion and ignorance; these in whom the humors have deviated from their courses, or are in an unbalanced or in a plethoric condition; those who make use of in the manner forbidden by the dietetic rules, of improper dietary articles, which are unclean and ill prepared; those who abuse the general rules of healthful living; as also those resorting to other kinds of wrongful bodily activity; those in whom the morbific humors have become exacerbated as a result of extreme emaciation, and those whose minds have become obscured by passion and ignorance—in such, the morbific humors lie in wait above the heart which is the seat, par excellence of the indwelling spirit, and around the sense organs.
4. When these humors, thus lying dormant, are aroused by a sudden accession of desire, anger, fear, greed, infatuation, excitement, grief, worry, or anxiety, they occlude the channels of the heart and the sense organs, and then the man falls into an epileptic fit.
Its Differential Diagnosis
5. Epilesy is defined as a paroxysmal loss of consciousness due to disturbance of memory and understanding of the mind, attended with convulsive seizures;
Its Premonitory Symptoms
6. These are its premonitory symptoms: spasmodic movements of the muscles of the eye-brow, constant disorderly movement of the eye, acousma, dribbling of saliva and nasal discharge, inappetence, anorexia, misdigestion, cardiac spasm, distension of the abdomen, debility, bonefracture, body-ache, delusion, faintness, fainting, giddiness, frequent appearance in dreams of scenes of intoxication, dancing, piercing, affliction, trembling and falling etc.
7. Thereafter there is the onset of epilepsy (apasmara).
The Signs of the Vata Epilepsy
8-(l) These are the special characteristics of epilepsy (apasmara), viz, frequent attacks of transient unconsciousness and immediate regaining of consciousness, bulging of the eyes, incoherent speech, issue of frothy saliva from the mouth, great distension of the neck due to impeded respiration, head drawn to one side, irregular clenching of fingers, restlessness of hands and feet; dusky, red and harsh nails, eyes, face and skin; visual aura of jerky, fickle, harsh and dry objects; non-homologation to Vata causing factors and homologation to those that ate. antagonistic to Vata; the person afflicted with these symptoms should be known to be suffering from epilepsy of the Vata type.
The Signs of the Pitta type
8-(2). Frequent attacks of transient unconsciousness and immediate regaining of consciousness, stertorous breathing, tossing on the ground, green, yellow or coppery coloration of nails, eyes, face and skin, visual aura of blood-smeared, fierce terrifying, blazing and angry-looking forms, non-homologation to Pitta-causing factors, and homologation to those which are antagonistic to Pitta- The persons afflicted with these symptoms should be known to be suffering from epilepsy of the Pitta type.
The Signs of the Kapha type
8-(3). Slowly becoming unconscious and slowly regaining consciousness, falling on the ground not accompanied with very strong convulsive movements, dribbling of saliva from the mouth, pallor of nails, eyes, face and skin, visual aura of white, heavy and glossy shapes, non-homologation to Kapha-causing factors and homologation to those antagonistic to Kapha; a person afflicted with these symptoms should be known to be suffering from epilepsy of the Kapha type.
The Signs of the Tri discordance type
8-(4). that should be known the epileptic condition due to tri-discordance of humors when all the symptoms manifest in a combined form. This is said to be incurable.
8. Thus have been described the four kinds of epilepsy (apasmara).
The Sequela in epilepsy of the Exogenous type
9. These epileptic types are sometimes associated with the type due to exogenous causes. This will be described later in the Section on Therapeutics. Its differential characteristic is the presence of additional symptoms which are not in accordance with the endogenous morbid humors
10. Only strong purificatory or sedative measures applied as indicated are beneficial to the epileptics; (Mantra) incantation and similar measures are used when the endogenous type is associated with the exogenous one,
11. It was during the destruction of the sacrifice of Daksha, that Gulma first arose in the past as the result of the agitated bodily movements gone through by the assembled persons who in their panic ran helter-skelter in all directions running, Swimining, racing, flying, jumping etc. Also at this, time,, the urinary and dermic disorders took their rise a, the result of the libations that were eaten, the insanities as the result of fear, alarm and grief, and the epilepsies as the result of the pollution by various kinds of unclean beings. As regards fever, we have already described how it arose from the forehead of great God, Shiva. From the heat induced by fever arose the disease hemothermia. As for consumption, it took its rise from the excessive sex-indulgence of the Lord of the constellations, i e, the Moon
Here are verses again—
12. The occurrence of epilepsy (apasmara) is due to Vata, Pitta and Kapha singly and fourthly due to tri-discordance; and the last one is incurable.
13. The intelligent and conscientious physicians accomplish the cure of remediable types of disease by strong, purificatory and sedative medications as indicated.
14 If the condition due to morbid humors is associated with that of the exogenous origin, then the best of the physicians advise the general measures meant for both.
15. The physician who is expert in the differential diagnosis of all diseases, and possesses the thorough pharmacological knowledge, cures all diseases and is never confused,
16.Thus has been described, in toto, the excellent Section on Pathology. There are seen diseases which act as causative factors of other diseases.
17. For example, hemothermia may be produced as the result of the heat of the fever, and fever as the result of hemothermia, and from both these, consumption may be produced.
18. Abdominal affections may result from the enlargement of the spleen, and edema may result from the abdominal affections, and from piles there may result painful abdominal swelling as well as Gulma.
19. Cough may result from coryza and from cough wasting may result, and wasting acting as a causative factor may lead to consumption.
20. There are diseases which exist first as such alone and later change into causative factors of other diseases Some diseases embody both these conditions while some embody one condition only.
21. Sometimes the disease, after giving rise to another disease subsides. There are other diseases which produce yet other diseases without themselves subsiding
22. Such admixtures of diseases in human beings become most formidable for treatment, owing to the complexity of the line of treatment, and serve as causative factors of each other.
23.The course of treatment which cures the original disease but produces some other kind of complication is not the correct line of treatment; the correct one is that which cures but does not provoke any other.
24. One and the. same causative factor may lead to many disease-conditions. Again, a single causative factor may lead to a single disease. Many causative factors may bring only one disease. Again many causative factors may lead to many diseases.
25. Fever, giddiness, delirium and such other diseases seem to be produced by one cause, viz., dryness, and also from the same cause of dryness fever alone is produced.
26. Fever is produced by dryness and many similar causative factors;, and fever and many other diseases are produced by dryness and many similar causative factors
27. There is one symptom common to many diseases and there may be one symptom pathognomic of one disease alone. There may be many symptoms of one disease and there may be many symptoms of one disease and there may be many symptoms common to many diseases.
28. One symptom, i.e. fever, is considered the common symptom for many diseases which have an irregular onset; and genaral heating is considered the pathognomic symptom of one disease—fever.
29. Irregular onset and similar other symptoms appear as the signs of the disease—fever, while similar symptoms also occur in severe dyspnea, hiccup and other similar diseases.
30. A single remedy may alleviate many diseases or there may be only one remedy for one particular disease. There may be many remedies for one disease, and many remedies for many diseases.
31 The lightening therapy may alleviate many gastrogenous diseases, while again, the lightening therapy is considered the only remedy for fever.
32. Also lightening and other therapeutic measures are used for the alleviation of fever; aud all these measures may be used for the alleviation of a number of diseases like fever, dyspnea, hiccup and similar conditions
33. An easily curable disease is cured by easy measures and in a short period, while formidable diseases are cured only by great efforts and after a long period.
34. The disease which does not completely disappear on treatment, belongs to the palliable class of incurable disease, while the other class of incurable diseases where no treatment is of any avail, is called irremediable.
35. Incurable diseases never become curable, while curable diseases may pass into the stage of iucurability on account of the shortcomings in any of the four basic therapeutic factors, or as the result of destiny.
36. The wise physician should carefully investigate even the minutest changes in the hypertrophy, normality and the atrophy of the morbid element as well as the strength of the body, gastric fire, vitality and mind.
37. The circumspect physician, constantly observing the variations, in the stages of the diseases should prescribe such treatment as is helpful in attaining the fourfold blessing of therapeusis
38. Generally, the morbid humors which have spread sideways, afflict the patient for a long time. In this condition the physician cognisant of the nature of the body, gastric fire and vitality should not be in a hurry to counteract the morbid elements.
39. These morbid humors should be eliminated by a slow course of treatment or drawn painlessly into the alimentary tract; and when they have returned to the alimentary tract, the wise physician should eliminate them through the nearest passage of exit.
40. In this epitome of description of the diseases, some of those that have been mentioned as the symptoms of diseases appear as independent diseases. As long as they exist secondarily, they are called symptoms and not diseases.
41. In short everything in the world has only two conditions, abnormal and normal; both of them are dependant upon a cause. Nothing can happen in the absence of a cause.
Summary
Here are the recapitulaory verses—
42. Causative factors, premonitory symptoms, symptoms, homologation, course of the disease, primogenesis, mere outline of treatment;
43. curability or otherwise of the eight diseases, viz. fever and others, separate description of the causes, symptoms and treatment of each of these diseases;
44. synonyms of etiological factors, diseases and symptoms—these are, thus, concisely described in the Section on Pathology.
6. Thus, in the Section on Pathology in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the eighth chapter entitled “The Pathology of Epilepsy (apasmara-nidana)” is completed.
Thus ends the Section on Pathology.
The proper utilization of all six Tastes
4. Now, first of all, we shall discourse on the action of tastes, substances, humors and disorders. The tastes are six—sweet, acid, salt, pungent, bitter and astringent. These property used sustain the body in health; ill-used, they bring about the provocation of the humors.
The benefits of the humors in their normal state and harmfulness in their provoked conditions
5. And the humors are three: Vata, Pitta and Kapha. When normal they cause the proper functioning of the body; when they have become abnormal they certainly afflict the body by causing disorders of various types
The Triads of tastes and their effects on Humors
6-(1). Each of these three humors is provoked by three tastes and is allayed by the other three tastes.
6. Thus, the pungent, bitter and astringent tastes provoke Vata; the sweet, acid and salt tastes allay it; the pungent, acid and salt tastes provoke Pitta; the sweet, bitter and astringent tastes allay it; the sweet, acid and salt tastes provoke Kapha; the pungent bitter and astringent tastes allay it.
7. As regards the interaction of tastes and humors, the use of tastes which are homologous are mostly homogeneous in quality to a particular humor, augment that humor, whereas the use of the tastes which are antagonistic in quality to a particular humor, will allay that humor. It is in order to enable the understanding of this mode of operation that the hexaplicity of tastes and the triplicity of humors, considered individually, that is, uncombined with each other, has been taught.
8 The extent of their combination and permutations is innumerable on account of the innumerability of the varying degrees of their possible combinations and permutations.
9. Now, from among the substances evincing various tastes and from among the disorders evincing morbidity of various humors, examining the actions of each of the tastes and humors individually, one should thereafter determine the action of the given substance and of the given disorder.
10. But this does not hold good every where. It is not possible to infer the action of a compound substance from the action of the constituents, as in a compound the properties of various forms and properties and methods one with the other get changed, when thus variously combined.
11. In such complex cases, therefore, one should, having ascertained the action of the compound substance as a whole, determine the action of that compound substance on the particular combination of humors.
12. Hence we shall expound the principles of action with reference to tastes, substances, humors and disorders.
13. The actions of tastes have been enunciated. Now, we shall expound the actions of substances; oil, ghee and honey are the allaying agents in Vata, Pitta and Kapha respectively.
Oil is Curative of Vata
14-(1). Among these the regular use of oil subdues Vata on account of its possessing unctuous, hot. and heavy qualities, for Vata, possessing as it does the qualities of dryness, coldness and lightness, is of the opposite nature. When there is interaction between the qualities of the opposite type, it is the stronger that subdues the weaker. Hence the systematic use of oil subdues Vata.
Ghee is curative of Pitta
14-(2). Similarly, ghee subdues Pitta owing to its sweet, cooling and.slow qualities, for Pitta is anti-sweet, hot and acute in quality.
Honey is curative of Kapha
14-(3). And honey subdues Kapha on.account of its dry, acute and astringent qualities as Kapha is unctuous, dense and sweet.
14. In this manner, the use of other substances too, which are antagonistic in quality to Vata, Pitta and Kapha will subdue these humors when used regularly.
Excessive use forbidden of long Pepper, Alkali and Salt
15. Now, there are three substances whose excessive use is more strictly forbidden than that of other substances. They are long pepper, alkali and common salt.
16-(1). Long pepper, pungent though in taste, is sweet in post-digestion, heavy, neither overmuch unctuous nor over-much hot, is deliquescent and esteemed as medicine. It is at once productive of beneficial and baneful effects. If administered in the proper time and measure, its action is at once beneficial.
16.But if continued for over a long period, it results in morbid cumulative effect, as, due to its heavy and deliquescent qualities, it arouses Kapha. It aggravates Pitta on account of its hot property and is not able to allay Vata because of its meagreness of unctuous and hot qualities. Nevertheless it makes a good vehicle. In view of these considerations long pepper should not be used, in excess.
17-(1). Alkali is possessed of hot, acute and light qualities; it first acts as a deliquescent and later as a desiccant. It is used as a digestive, cans tic and disruptive agent. If used in excess, it results in harmful effects to hair, eyes, heart and manhood.
17. Those communities, whether rural, urban or itinerant, which make constant use of alkali, develop blindness, impotency, baldness and greyness of hair, and constricting pain in the cardiac region. Instances of such communities are—the people of Eastern countries and the Chinese. In view of these considerations one should not use alkali in excess,
18-(1). Common salt is possessed of hot and acute qualities, is not very heavy, unctuous, is deliquescent, acts as a laxative, gives a relish to foodstuffs, given in proper course and combination, it has immediate beneficial action, but continued over a long period results in morbid cumulative effect. It is prescribed as an appetizer, digestive, deliquescent and laxative Used in excess, it causes depression, flabbiness and debility in the body. Those communities which are given to over use of salt, whether they are country people, city-dwellers or itinerants, become languid, flabby and anemic and are unable to bear hardships.
18. They are the people of Bahlika, Saurashtra, Sind, and Sauvira. They always habitually take salt in their milk; also wherever there are saltish regions of laud there herbs, creepers, trees and vegetation either do not grow at all or are of poor quality, on account of the inhibiting effect of salt on their growth. Hence salt should not be used in excess. Even those people who have become tolerant to excessive use of salt get premature baldness, greyness and wrinkles.
19. Even in the case of such people, therefore, it is advisable to effect a gradual withdrawal from the habit formed. A gradual withdrawal as previously laid down from a habit will be attended with no severe reaction or with very mild reaction.
The definition of Homologation
20-(1). Habituation is that which agrees with one’s system. Thus habituation has the same connotation as homologation
20 Now homologation is of three kinds: best, poor, and medium. It is again of seven kinds: agreeability to each or one of the six tastes and seventh by agreeability to all of them combined. Among these, the agreeability to all the tastes is the best type of homologation; the poorest type is the agreeability only to a single taste, while the medium type of agreeability is the mean Between the best and the poorest. So from the poorest and the medium agreeabilities -one should develop the homo legation of the best type, that is, agreeability to all the tastes. After acquiring homologation to all the tastes, one should resort to what is wholesome, having considered well the special factors concerning diet and dietetics described in the octalogue beginning with natural qualities.
The Eight aspects of Dietetics
21. The following are the eight factors of diet and dietetics. They are:—Natural qualities, Karana [karaṇa] (preparation), Samyoga [saṃyoga] (combination), Rashi [rāśi] (quantum), Desha [deśa] (habitat), Kala [kāla] (stage of disease), Upayoga (rules of use) and Upayokta [upayoktā] (user)—this makes the octalogue of diet and dietetics.
22-(1); Among these natural qualities are the innate properties of substances. The presence of qualities like heaviness etc., is the natural property of substances, used as diet or drug. Thus, heaviness is the nature of blackgram and pork, and lightness that of green gram and venison.
22-(1A), Preparation is the process performed to modify the natural properties: of substances. That which modifies radically the properties of substances is transformation.
22-(2). This modification is brought about by dilution, application of heat (vaporization, distillation and sublimation), clarification, emulsification, storing, maturing, flavouring, impregnation, preservation, and the material of receptacle.
22-(3). Combination is the combining together of two or more substances. This chemical combination exhibits special properties which none of the constituents ever possessed Examples—the combination of honey and ghee; honey or ghee taken alone is wholesome to the body but com bined together, they become toxic Similarly, the combination of honey, fish and milk has a toxic effect
22-(4). The Rashi quantum) is the measure of the total mass and of each constituent in order to determine the effects of the right and wrong doses The measure of the entire meal as a whole is the total measurement. The measuring of each article of diet is detailed measurement. Measuring all together is total measurement; measuring the parts separately is also detailed measurement.
22-(5). Habitat is a geographic region. It indicates variations in the qualities of substances, due to difference in soil, use and climate.
22-(6). ‘Time’ is used in two senses, time in the general sense and time in the sense of a stage. Now ‘Stage’ is used in relation to disease, and ‘Time' in the general sense is used in relation to seasonal wholesomeness-
22-(7). The procedure in diet consists of the dietetic rules. They are determined by the strength of digestion.
22. The user is he who makes use of food; ‘habituation’ depends on him. Thus we have explained the eight special factors in the science of diet and dietetics.
23. These different factors give rise to good and evil effects and are helpful to one another. The physician should try to know them; and having known them he should make use of the wholesome only. Either out of ignorance or negligence he should not make use of any article of diet or any other thing which is pleasant but unwholesome and fraught with unhappy consequences.
24-(1). These are the dietetic rules and procedure for those who are healthy as well as for certain types of patients, concerning the taking of food that is most wholesome.
The most wholesome Dietetic Regulations
24.One should eat food which is hot, unctuous and non-antagonistic in potency and in due measure, after full digestion of the previous meal, in a congenial place, provided with all the accessories, neither too hurriedly, nor too leisurely, without talking or laughing, with full concentration and having proper regard to oneself.
25-(1). We shall indicate the benefits accruing from each of these conditions.
One should eat hot. It is the food eaten hot, that is relished and which on being consumed excites the gastric fire, which is soon digested and stimulates the peristaltic movement and breaks up the mucus in the gastric secretion. Therefore, one should eat food that is hot.
25-(2). Eat unctuous. The unctuous food, being eaten, gives relish and on being consumed, excites the inactive gastric fire, is rapidly digested, stimulates the peristaltic movement, makes the body plump, strengthens the sense-organs, increases the vigor and brightens the complexion. Therefore one should eat unctuous.food
25-(3). Eat in measure. The food eaten in measure does not disturb the balance of Vata, Pitta and Kapha, but exclusively promotes life, is easily passed down to the rectum, does not disturb the gastric fire and is easily assimilated. Therefore one must eat in measure,
25-(4). Eat after the digestion of the previous meal. The food that is eaten while the previous meal is lying undigested in the stomach, getting mixed with the semi-digested chyme of the previous meal, immediately provokes all the humors The food taken when the previous meal has been fully digested, the humors have returned to their normal places, the gastric fire is kindled, hunger is born, the channels are clear and open, the eructation from the mouth is healthy, the stomach is clear, the peristaltic movement is normal and when the urges for evacuation of flatus, urine and feces are well attended to—that food, not vitiating any of the body-elements, serves the sole purpose of promoting life. Therefore, one should eat on an empty stomach after the digestion of the previous meal.
25-(5). Eat what is not antagonistic in potency. Eating the food that is not antagonistic in potency, one is not afflicted with disorders born of incompatible dietary. Therefore one should eat what is not antagonistic in potency.
25-(6). Eat in a congenial place provided with all the necessary appurtenances. One eating in a congenial place does not get depressed in the mind by the depressing emotions produced in unpleasant environment Similarly, with the appurtenances. Therefore, one should eat in a congenial place and circumstance.
25-(7). Do not eat hurriedly. By eating hurriedly the food is liable to go the wrong way, or injure the health or it is not properly placed; and there is no appreciation of either the good or bad qualities of the food taken. Therefore one should not eat hurriedly.
25-(8). Do not eat too leisurely. One, eating too leisurely, is not satisfied even if he eats much. The food gets cold and is digested irregularly. Therefore one should not eat too leisurely.
25-(9). Do not talk or laugh while eating. One who talks and laughs and is preoccupied while eating, is liable to suffer the same disorders as the one who eats too hastily. Therefore, one should not talk or laugh while eating, but should eat with due attention to oneself
25. Eat rightly, considering your constitution. ‘This food will agree with me, this food will not agree with me’, such knowledge makes for the determination of what is wholesome for each individual. Therefore, one should eat rightly, considering ones individual constitution.
In Praise of Physicians versed in the Science of Taste
Here is a verse again—
26.Him do we regard as a physician, who possesses the knowledge of the effects of tastes, the substances, the humors and the diseases, as also the knowledge of clime, season, and the body.
Summary
Here are the two recapitulatory verses—
27-28. The purpose of this section on specific determination of measure, the effects of the tastes, substances, humors and diseases, the substances that are not to be taken in excess, the three grades of homologation, the octalogue of dietetic rules, the advantages accruing from the observation of these rules—all these, have been made clear in this chapter on the specific determination of the measure of taste.
1. Thus, in the Section on Specific Determination of Measure in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the first chapter entitled the “Specific Determination, of the Measure of Taste (rasa-vimana—vimāna)” is completed.
The three divisions of the Stomach Capacity
3. One, about to eat a meal, ought to dispose the stomach capacity in three parts (trividha-kukshi—kukṣi). Thus, he should use one third of his gastric capacity for solid food, one third for liquids and the remaining one third for the full play of the three humors—Vata, Pitta and Kapha. Eating in conformity to this rule, one is not liable to any one of the ill-effects resulting from eating without measure.
Measure of food in respect of Quantity
4. However, it is not possible to obtain the full benefit accruing from diet by merely conforming to the rule of measure, since all the eight factors beginning with the nature of the food-constituents have each a share in the final result.
5. Here, however, we are concerned with determining the results of the quantity of food in measure or out of measure. The whole of the dietetic mode as regards quantity resolves itself into food taken in measure and food taken out of measure.
The Effects of Measured diet
6-(1). Now measure has already been touched upon in relation to the disposition of the gastric capacity. We shall explain the same thing once again at greater length.
6. Thus, the following are the signs of food eaten in measure: freedom from distress in the stomach (kukshi) as the result of the quantity taken; absence of any cardiac discomfort; the non-distension of the sides, freedom from excessive heaviness of the stomach, gratification of the senses, subsidence of hunger and thirst, sense of ease in standing, sitting lying down, walking, exhaling and inhaling, repartee and conversation; easeful digestion and assimilation of food in the evening and morning; the imparting of strength, complexion and plumpness.
The Evils of inadequate diet
7-(1). Now the absence of measure is laid down as coming under two heads—the deficient and the excessive. The diet which is deficient in measure seen to result in the impairment of strength, complexion and plumpness, in want of satisfaction, in misperistalsis and the impairment of the functions of life, virility and vitality, body, mind, understanding and senses, in the vitiation of the eight body-elements, in inducing inauspicious conditions and in the incidence of the eighty kinds of Vata disorders. The learned aver that the diet which is excessive in measure is provocative of the morbidity of all the three humors.
7-(2). He who eats solid foods to repletion and in addition drinks his fill of beverages, will have all the three humors—Vata, Pitta and Kapha abiding in the stomach, provoked simultaneously, as they get compressed greatly by the excessive quantity of the food taken. These humors, being thus irritated, lay hold of the undigested food mass and getting localised in one part of the stomach [i.e., kukshi] of the man who has over-eaten, and making their resort in the foodmass, either obstruct or dispose of the stomach-contents violently through the upper or the lower channels of the alimentary tract, giving rise, severally, to the following kinds of disorders.
7. The Vata causes colic, constipation, body-ache, parching of the mouth, fainting, giddiness, irregularity of the gastric fire, rigidity of the sides, back and waist and the contraction and the hardening of the vessels. The Pitta causes fever, diarrhea, internal burning thirst, intoxication, giddiness and delirium, The Kapha causes vomiting, anorexia, indigestion, algid fevers, torpor and heaviness of the limbs.
8.It is not the excessive intake of food alone that is responsible for setting up the ills of chyme-disorder. The following factors too induce the chyme-disorders, viz., the untimely indulgence in foods and drinks that are heavy, dry, cold, dehydrated, disagreeable, retardent, irritant, unclean or incompatible, or eating and drinking while the mind is afflicted with desire, anger, greed, infatuation, envy, shame, grief, indignation, anxiety and fear.
Here is a verse again—
9. The food eaten by one who is given to anxiety, grief, fear auger, pain, sedentary habits or to keeping awake at night, though it be the prescribed diet. and is eaten with strict regard to measure, will fail to be digested properly.
The Various Chyme-disorders
10. The physicians divide the chyme-disorders into two classes viz., acute alimentary irritation, and intestinal torpor.
The Signs of intestinal irritation
11. of. these the expulsion of undigested food either through the upper or lower charnels of the alimentary canal with the symptoms already mentioned should be known as acute alimentary irritation.
The Signs of intestinal torpor
12-(1). We shall now describe the disorder of intestinal torpor. Let us take a man who is frail, of weak digestion, of Kapha habitus, habitually given to suppressing the urges of flatus, urine and feces and who is given to eating food which is compact, heavy, large in quantity, dry, cold and dehydrated. Such food and drink consumed by such a one, though painfully urged on by peristalsis cannot find an outlet, as it gets inert owing to the passages being obstructed by the accumulated Kapha and the food masses being jammed inside. In consequence of this condition, the symptoms of general indigestion, excepting the two—vomiting and purging, manifest themselves in a very aggravated form.
12-(2). This brings about extreme vitiation of the humors which finding the alimentary canal blocked at both ends by the vitiated mass of undigested food, tend to spread sideways and in that process, not infrequently cause the body to become rigid like a staff. This condition which is spoken of as “Dandalasaka” [daṇḍālasaka], “Staff like rigidity”, is considered to be incurable.
The Signs of Food-poisoning
12. The chyme-disorder which results from incompatible foods, or from eating predigestion-meals, is named by the physicians as intestinal toxemia because it evinces symptoms similar to those of toxemia. Such a disorder is indeed absolutely irremediable, because of its fulminating character and also because of the antagonism in the lines of treatment indicated.
The Treatment of the Above Conditions
13-(1). Now the remediable variety of chyme-disorder in which the in taken food is vitiated and becomes stagnant, should be treated thus:—To begin with, the patient should be made to vomit by the administration of an emetic consisting of warm saline water; thereafter he should be treated with sudation and suppositories and made to fast.
13-(2). In cases of acute alimentary irritation, the patient should first be subjected to lightening therapy and the after-treatment should be the same as: that in purification therapy.
13-(3). In chyme-disorder, when dealing with a patient; who has digested his last meal but whose stomach morbid humors and is inactive and heavy and who is averse to food medicine should be administered at the meal time with a view to helping the digestion of the remaining morbid matter in the stomach and the stimulation of the digestive fire. But if the patient has not digested his last meal, this procedure is not to be followed. For, the digestive fire that has been enfeebled by the chyme-disorder is unable to digest, at one and the same time, the vitiated humor, the medicine and the intaken food-mass.
is still smeared with
13-(4). Since the untoward effect, cumulatively of the chyme disorder, the medicine and the food, is too great it will perforce hasten to death the enfeebled patient in whom the thermal processes have become inactive.
13-(5). The ailments resulting from chyme disorder are to be quieted only through the depletion therapy. If, however, the effect of disease persists even after the depletory treatment, then for the subjugation of the disease, the physician should give up treating the disease with reference to the causative factors and begin treating the actual morbid conditions.
13-(6). In the conquest of all disorders the learned physicians give the first place to. those drugs that are antagonistic to both the morbific and the morbid factors or other
therapeutic agents which serve the same purpose.
13. After he has been relieved of the chyme-disorder and after all the morbid matter has been fully digested and the gastric fire has been re activated, the patient should be administered systematically and with skill, inunction, corrective and unctuous enemata and the oleation therapy, with due consideration to the morbific factor, the drug indicated, the place, the season, the patients vitality, his physical condition, his diet, his habituation, his psychic makeup, his constitution, his age, as weel as the disorders that have to be treated.
Here is a verse again—
14. Having examined well the eight rules concerning diet, one should secure one’s own well-being; in addition whatever else is indicated here as a means in the pursuit of wholesome things, one should have recourse to all such things
The Seat of Digestion
15. Where is the food digested, the food that is eaten, that is masticated that is drunk, and that is licked up? O, wise one! this we would like to know of your worship. Declare it to us, O, enlightened one!
16. Having been questioned thus by the assembly of disciples headed by Agnivesha, Punarvasu enlightened them as to where food is digested.
17. That part of the human body which lies between the navel and the nipple-line is called the seat of digestion. It is here that all that is eaten, masticated, drunk and licked up is digested.
18. The food that has reached the seat of digestion, being fully digested, is, in its changed form, circulated to the entire body by means of the vessels.
Summary
Here is the recapitulatory verse—
19. The signs and results of food eaten in measure, as well as those of food eaten out of measure, have been accurately described separate y in this chapter.
2. Thus, in the Section on Specific Determination of Measure in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka the second chapter entitled the “Specific Determination of the Measure of Stomach Capacity (kukshi-vimana)” is completed.
Herbs to be gathered before epidemics set in
4-(2). Therefore, well before such calamities occur and well before the earth has lost her savour, O, gentle one! collect the medicinal herbs while yet their taste, potency) post-digestive effects and specific action remain unvitiated.
4-(3). We shall thus, when the occasion arises, make use of the taste, potency, post-digestive effects and the specific action of these herbs for the benefit of those who seek us and also those whom we seek to help.
4. Nor indeed, O, gentle one! are counter-measures to epidemics that destroy populations [i.e., janapada-uddhvamsa] a difficult matter, provided the medicinal herbs are properly culled, properly prepared aud properly administered.
Agnivesa’s Query
5-(1). Unto the worshipful Atreya thus exhorting, Agnivesha submitted, “O, worshipful one! the medicinal plants shall be property cubed, well-prepared and well administered according to your instructions.
5. But, how does the simultaneous destruction of communities [i.e., janapada-uddhvamsa], consisting as they do of individuals who differ from one another in constitution, diet, physique, vitality, habits, psychic make-up and age, take’ place by the incidence of one single disease?”
Atreya’s Explanation
6-(1). Unto him replied the worshipful Atreya, “O, Agnivesha! though a community may be heterogeneous in. respect of the constitution etc. of its individual members, there are other common factors which being adversely affected, will cause simultaneous outbreak of diseases having similar symptoms. It is these that devastate whole populations [i.e., janapada-uddhvamsa].
6. The factors that affect a people in common are—the winds, the waters, the country and the seasons.
The Unsalutary wind
7-(1). Of these, the wind, if of the following description, is to be known as disease-inducing—viz. unseasonal, totally becalmed, violently blowing, exceedingly rough, intensely cold, intensely hot, excessively dry, excessively humid, fearfully clamorous, blowing from contrary directions and clashing with itself, extremely rotatory (whirlwind) and charged with unwholesome odors, moisture, sand, dust and smoke.
The Unsalutary waters
7-(2). The water of the following description is to be known as bereft of virtue: having an extremely aberrant smell, color, taste and touch; abounding in putrescent matter; deserted by aquatic birds; in which the aquatic creatures are atrophied and which is unpleasant.
The Unsalutary country
7-(3) The country of the following description is to be known as unwholesome: having color, odor, taste and touch that are unnatural, excessively damp; abounding in serpents, beasts of prey, mosquitoes, locusts, flies, mice, owls, birds and animals such as the jackal, and abounding in woods or weeds and Ulupa grass; abounding in creepers; where crops have either fallen, withered or been destroyed in an unprecedented manner; where the winds are smoky; where the sound of birds is unceasing; where the baying of dogs always assails the ears; where herds of animals and flocks of birds of various kinds are always in a state of alarm and pain; where amidst the people, morality, truth, modesty, custom, character and virtue have either declined or been given up; where the waters are always agitated and upheaving; which is frequently subjected to the incidence of meteorites, thunderbolts and earthquakes; where nature is full of menacing sounds and sights; where the sun, the moon and the stars are frequently covered by dry, coppery, ruddy and grey clouds and which lastly, is as if full of constant alarm and lamentation, crying, fright, and darkness as if visited by gnomes, and as if abounding in sounds of lamentation.
The Unsalutary season
7(4). A season which is of the following description is to be known as unwholesome, evincing characteristics that are opposite to normal, or evincing its characteristics in an excessive or deficient degree.
7. The learned declare these very four factors when possessed of the morbidity described above to be destructive of populations [i.e., janapadoddhvamsa]; when not so blemished, they are said to be wholesome,
General Countering Measures
8. But even when these depopulating factors have turned inauspicious, there is no fear of diseases to those persons who are served with medicines that have been culled beforehand.
The relative morbific quality of vitiated climate
Here are verses again—
9, We shall now indicate, assigning reasons, the ascending scale of importance among the four factors of country, season, wind and water that have turned insalubrious.
10. The man of understanding will know that the water is more important than wind, and conntiy[?] more important than the water, and season yet more important than country by virtue of their degree of indispensability.
11. The specialist should know that the above mentioned aberrations of wind and the other factors are progressively easy of treatment in the order mentioned.
General Treatment in Epidemics
12. Even if all the four factors including Time (season) become vitiated, as long as men are sustained by medicine, so long will they remain free of disease.
13.In case of such members of the community as are neither destined to die at the same time, nor have the compulsion of common action, the quinary purification procedure consisting of emetics, purgatives, dry and unctuous enemata and errhines), is said to be the best of medicaments.
14. For them, moreover, the rightful use of vitalising medications is recommended; the maintenance of the body by means of the medicinal herbs culled beforehand is also commended.
15-18. Truthfulness, compassion for creatures, charity, sacrifices, worship of the gods, the observance of right conduct, tranquility, prophylactic protection of oneself and seeking one’s own good, residing in a wholesome country, the keeping of continence and the company of the continent, consulting the scriptures and the great self-restrained sages, constant association with the righteous, the well-dispositioned and those who are approved of by the elders—all this with a view to preserving life, has been indicated as “medicine” to those who are not destined to die in that terrible time.
Causes for the Vitiation of wind etc.
19. On being thus apprised of the causes that bring about mass-destruction of communities [i.e., janapada-uddhvamsa], Agnivesha questioned the worshipful Atreya once again, ‘Now tell us, O, Lord! what makes the wind etc., to become inclement, through which inclemency they tend to destroy pupulations’.
29-(1). The worshipful Atreya answered him, “O Agnivesha! the deterioration affecting the wind, etc., has its origin in transgression, or, in the alternative, in unrighteous deeds performed in a former existence; of both, the source is volitional transgression alone.
20-(2). Thus when the ruling authorities of the country, cities, trade-guilds etc., govern the people irresponsibly by transgressing the law, then their subordinates and under-subordinates, the towns-folk and the villagefolk, as well as those who earn a living by practising professions, tend to promote the growth of lawlessness. In the result, disorder, perforce swallows up all order. Thereafter, these people, from whom the law has become a fugitive, are given up even by the gods.
29. It is then that the seasons change adversely for these people, from whom the law has receded, whose actions have become unlawful and who are forsaken of the gods. On account of this, the heaven? do not rain in reason, or never at all, or abnormally the winds do not blow rightly; the earth is afflicted, the waters dry up, the herbs lose their true properties and suffer deterioration. In consequence, due people perish as the result of infectious contact or ingestion.
Unrighteousness, the cause of War and of Accursed Calamities
21. In the same manner, it is unrighteousness alone that is the cause of the destruction of peoples [i.e., janapada-uddhvamsa] by armaments. Those who are moved by extravagant greed, anger, folly, or arrogance despising the weak for the destruction of themselves, their people and the enemy, come into armed conflict either among themselves or with others; or they themselves are attacked by others
22. Again, it is on account of unrighteousness or some other transgression that the various kinds of diabolic powers, such as the order of the Rakshasas, assail and destroy a people.
23-(1). Likewise the destruction that springs from a curse has unrighteousness for its motive-force. It is those who are guilty of dereliction of duty that by disrespecting the preceptors, elders adepts, seers and the worshipful ones, act injuriously to themselves
23-(2). Being cursed by these preceptors and others to perish in company with their kith and kin they are soon reduced to ashes.
23. It follows that others that survive must be of indeterminate life-span from the perception of the cause of such predetermination of the life-span.
The Decrease of virtue and life-span by a Quarter in each age
24-(1). Even in ancient times, calamities never resulted from any factor other than unrighteousness.
24-(2). In the primal age, men were endowed with vitality equal to that of the sons of Aditi, exceedingly blameless and unhampered in their powers, had direct knowledge of the gods, the god-like sages, the divine law, the sacrifices, the sacrificial injunctions and the ritual, possessed bodies that were compact and firm like adamant clear senses and complexions, speed, strength and prowess like those of the wind; they were callipygian and their stature, lineaments, carriage and build accorded with their forms; they were devoted to truth, rectitude, compassion, charity, self-restraint, moral discipline, spiritual endeavour, fasting, continence and religious vows; they were free from fear, desire, aversion, infatuation, greed, anger, despondency, pride, disease, sleep, indolence, fatigue, langour, sloth and the spirit of acquisition; and lastly, they were endued with unlimited longevity. For the benefit of these people of heroic minds, qualities and deeds, the crops were replete with wonderful taste, potency, post-digestive effect, specific action and virtue, for the earth during the dawn of the golden age was charged to the full with all excellent qualities.
24-(3). As the first age wore on, those who were better circumstanced became heavy of body by over-indulgence; this heaviness of body bred lassitude, lassitude gave rise to indolence, indolence created the need for accumulation of goods, accumulation necessitated acquisition, the spirit of acquisition engendered greed. All this came to pass long ago, in the First Age
24. Thereafter, the bodies of human beings failing to receive sustenance as before from the progressively deteriorating quality of food and exercise and afflicted by heat and wind, soon succumbed to the attacks of fevers and other diseases. Thus, there was a gradual decline in the life span enjoyed by successive generations Thereafter, in the second or Silver Age greed brought malice in its wake; malice led to falsehood; falsehood let loose lust, anger, vanity, hatred, cruelty, aggression, fear, affliction, grief, anxiety, distress and the like. Consequently in the second age, virtue found itself deprived of a quarter of its plenitude. From this quarterly loss in virtue, there followed a similar deterioration in the duration of the succeeding age and in the beneficent power of the Earth and the other elements. It is in consequence of this deterioration that there took place a corresponding deterioration in the sap, purity taste, potency, post-digestive effects, specific action and quality of herbs.
Here are two verses again—
25 In this manner righteousness dwindles in each succeeding age by one quarter and the proto-elements too suffer similar deterioration till eventually the world comes to dissolution.
26.When a hundredth part of the length of an age is past, then the life-span of creatures gets less by one year. This is said with reference to the normal determination of life-span in any given age.
27. Thus, we have narrated the history of the primogenesis of diseases.
28. Unto the worshipful Atreya, discoursing thus, Agnivesha adderessed the following question, ‘What indeed, is the true position as regards the period of life? Is it in every case predetermind, or is it not so?’
Determinate and indeterminate life-span
Unto him the master replied—
29. ‘This matter of the life span of creatures depends on the consideration of the following factors: life, as regards both its strength and weakness, is determined by destiny as well as human effort.
30. ‘Destiny’ is to be known as one’s own actions done in the former life, while by ‘effort’ is meant one’s activity in this life.
31. Concerning these two kinds of activity, there are various degrees of strength and weakness; for we see that action is of three kinds—mild, moderate and strong.
32-32½. When both types of action (destiny and effort) are of the best character then they make for long, happy and certain life; the reverse is the ease when both types of action are of the reverse character; when they are moderate, then the life too is moderate. Now listen to a further consideration.
33-34 Thus, if destiny is weak, it admits of being overcome by effort; conversely, destiny that is powerful will render weak effort nugatory. Some people, observing only this last, rush to the conclusion that all life is predetermined.
35. There are some powerful actions whose fructification takes place at a predetermined time; but there is another kind of action whose fructification is not predetermined and lies latent till roused to activity by suitable conditions.
The Proof of the indeterminateness of the life-span
36-(1). Since, thus, we see that life is of both kinds (predetermined and unpredetermined) it is not right to cleave to either side exclusively. On this point, we wish to advance the following illustrations. If the lifeperiod in every case were predetermined, then none would be found to seek longevity by means of such acts as incantations medicinal herbs, magical stones, propitiations, sacrifices, offerings, oblations, regimen, penances, fastings, auspicious rites, genuflexions, pilgrimages, and sacrificial rites; nor would there be any need to avoid rogue, fierce and capricious bulls, elephants, camels, donkeys, horses, buffaloes and the like, and abnoxious winds, as also cataracts, and rapid precipitous and unfordable currents of water in the mountains, men that are drunk insane, vagrant, fierce, capricious and of minds excited by infatuation and greed, enemies, raging conflagrations, various kinds of venomous reptiles and serpents, rash acts, conduct that is out of season and out of place, and the displeasure of the king. For these and suchlike would hold no threat of destruction, all life being of predetermined duration. Again fear of premature death would not assail those who have not made use of prophylactic measures which ward off the threat of premature death The introductory propositions, the stories the recipes and the theories as propounded by the sages, concerning the subject of revitalisation and longevity become meaningless. Not even Indra can slay with his thunderbolt an enemy possessed of a predetermined span of life; nor can the Ashvins heal the ailing with the aid of medicine; norcan the great sages attain, by means of spiritual endeavour, such a period of life as they desire, nor can the great sages, including the chief of the gods himself all of whom know all that is to be known, can be said to perceive, teach and practise what is right.
36-(2). Now of all types of evidence, this that we observe with the eye is the best, and the following is founded on visual observation. Thus surveying thousands of cases, we find that the length of life enjoyed by those who repeatedly engage in fighting and those who keep away is not the same. Similarly, with regard to those whose disorders are rectified as soon as they manifest themselves and those whose disorders are not so treated the length of life enjoyed is not the same; similarly with those who take poison, and those who do not. For instance, the assurance of safety enjoyed by a water-pot which is subjected to wear and tear, and an ornamental vase is not the same. Thus length of life is a a matter of care and husbandry; the opposite conditions lead to death.
36. Moreover the right and gradual habituation to behaviour and dietetic articles which are antagonistic to the prevailing clime, season and one’s own constitution, avoidance of all that savours of excess, abstinence and abuse, the checking of all extravagant tendencies, the non-suppression of generated excretory urges and the giving up rash acts—all this we find to be conducive to healthful living; this is what we teach, and this is also what we observe.
Timely and Untimely death
37. On hearing this, Agnivesha said, “If thus, O, Lord! the lives of men are of un-predetermined duration, what makes for death in due time and death before time (prematurely)?”
38-(1). The worshipful Atreya said unto him, Listen, O, “Agnivesha! Let us take for instance, the axle of a carriage, so fashioned as to subserve the ends of an axle. Now that axle, which is endowed with all the needed efficiency, being drawn along, will cease to function only when, in the fullness of time, it is entirely worn out. In the same manner, the life-force, abiding in the body, being endowed with full vitality by nature and maintained in the right manner, will come to an end only with the complete wearing out of itself. This is spoken of as death in due time,
38. However, the self-same axle, if made to support too heavy a load, or if the road over which it moves is very uneven, or, indeed, if there is no road at all where it goes, or if the axle or wheels break, or if the draught animal or the: rider is clumsy, or if the pins fall off, or if it is not properly oiled or is jerked about, then the axle will break down before its time. In the same manner by the undertaking of tasks beyond one’s capacity, by eating beyond one s power of digestion, by promiscuous eating, by wrong movement of the body, by over-indulgence in sex-act, by the society of the wicked, by the checking of the generated excretory impulses, by the non-checking of those impulses which require to be checked, by being afflicted by evil spirits, poison, winds and fire, by receiving injuries, by abstaining from food and treatment when needed, the life of a man is cut short. Death, supervening In such circumstances, is premature death, Further, we observe premature death occurring as the result of wrong treatment of such maladies as fever.”
The Potion of Hot water in Fever
39. Agnivesha then questioned, “How is it. O, Lord! that generally the physicians give hot beverages to the fever-stricken in preference to cold ones, although one would imagine that the humor which causes the fevers is best allayed by refrigerant agents?”
40-(1). Unto him the worshipful Atreya made answer. “The physicians having regard to the factors of the bodily constitution) etiology, clime and season in so far as these have a bearing, give hot beverages to the fever-patient with a view to helping his digestion. For, fever arises from the stomach and the remedies generally used for disorders arising from the stomach own their virtue to their digestive, emetic and depletive action. Hot beverages promote digestion; that is why the physicians generally prescribe then to the fever-parents.
40-(2). On being drunk, they regulate the peristaltic movement of Vata, rouse the digestive fire, get soon absorbed, dry up the mucus and tend, even in small quantities to allay thirst.
40. Nevertheless, hot drinks are interdicted in fevers arising from the exacerbation of Pitta, attended by excessive burning, giddiness, delirium and diarrhea, seeing that these disorders are greatly aggravated by hot measures but quieted by cold measures.
The Treatment of Diseases on lines antagonistic to Etiological Factors
Here is a verse again—
41. The intelligent physicians allay the disorders born of heat by cold measures; and for those disorders that are born of cold, hot measures constitute the right treatment.
42. Similarly, with regard to the other ailments, too, treatment that allays, partakes of the opposite nature to that of etiology. Thus, for disorders born of depletion there is no cure excepting impletion; conversely for disorders of repletion there is no remedy save depletion
Depletion measures
43. Now depletion is of three kinds viz., starvation, starvation and activation of digestion, and elimination of morbid matter.
44-(1). Now, starvation is indicated in disorders of slight morbidity. Thereby the digestive fire and Vata being stimulated the slight morbidity is blotted out like a small quantity of water exposed to the sun and wind.
44-(2). Starvation and stimulation of digestion are indicated in disorders of moderate morbidity. For, by the starvation and the activation of digestion, the disorders of moderate morbidity are dried up like a sink that is acted upon by the sun and wind on the one hand and on the other is silted up by the falling dust and ashes.
44. As regards, however, disorders of severe morbidity, there is only one course, the elimination of the morbid matter. For, without making a breach in its dam, a reservoir cannot be drained of its water. Similar is the need for drainage in cases of excessive morbidity.
Those Naturally Unfit for Treatment
45. However, neither the therapy of elimination of morbid matter nor any other kind of medication should be administered, even when indicated, to the following kinds of patients—one who has not justified his honor when it is questioned, one.who is without wealth or attendants, one who fancies himself to be a doctor, one who is fierce-tempered one who is envious, one who takes keen pleasure in vicious acts, one who has lost his strength, flesh or blood to an inordinate extent, one who is afflicted of an incurable disease, and one who presents the fatal prognostic signs. By treating such a patient, the physician incurs opprobrious odium.
Avoidance of Evil actions
Here is a verse again—
46. One ought not to engage in an action which either in the doing or the consequence, gives rise to evil. Such is the view of the wise.
Definition of Arid and other types of Country
47. That is to be known as Jangala (arid) country which has scanty rainfall and vegetation, and is swept by high winds and enjoys abundant sunshine and which is least unhealthy.
48. That country which has abundant rainfall and luxuriant vegetation, few high winds and little sunshine, which gives rise to many bodily disorders is known as (Anūpa) wet-land. Where these two extremes are balanced that country is known as normal.
Summary
Here are the recapitulatory verses—
49-52. The portents that precede great destruction of peoples [i.e., janapada-uddhvamsa], the [general?] causes from which such destruction proceeds together with their individual characteristics the countermeasures, the source of the destructive causes the primogenesis of disease, the order of gradual diminution in the life-span of creatures, the determination of timely and untimely death, the manner of the occurrence of premature death, how administered a treatment achieves success, the patients that are not to be treated and for what reason—all this, has been expounded by Atreya, the best of the seers, to Agnivesha, in this chapter on the specific determination of the measure of wholesale destruction of Populations by Epidemics.
3. Thus, in the Section on Specific Determination of Measure in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the third chapter entitled “The Specific Determination of the Measure of Depopulation by Epidemics (janapadoddhvamsaniya—janapadoddhvamsa—uddhvamsa-vimana)” is completed.
Investigation by Testimony
6. The learned physicians impart instruction in the following way:each and every disease is to be known as having such and such exciting factors, such and such source, such and such onset, such and such location, such and such type of pain, such and such symptoms, such and such sound, touch, color, taste and odor, such and such complications, such and such stages of aggravation, steady continuance, and abatement, such and such result, such and such name and such and such concomitants. In view of these the prescriptions and prohibitions in the treatment of disease, one learns from instruction.
Investigation by Observation
7-(1). Seeking to know the nature of a disease by direct observation, the physician should explore by means of his sense-organs, with the exception of the tongue, the entire field of sensible data presented by the patient’s body. Thus he should examine with the ear (auscultation) the intestinal sounds, the sounds of the joints and the finger knuckles, variations in the patient’s voice or any other sounds that may be observed in any part of the body.
7-(2). He should examine with the eye the color, the shape, proportions and the lustre the healthy or diseased look of the body and whatever else though not mentioned here admits of visual inspection.
7-(3). The examination of the patient’s body by the seise of taste, though falling under direct observation is prohibited and should be done indirectly by influence. Thus it is by the method of interrogation that the physician should ascertain the existing taste in the patients mouth. Insipidity of his body secretions by the lice etc., deserting his body and the excessive sweetness of the body-secretions by the accumulation of flies on his body. If the disorder of hemothermia is suspected, then in order to determine whether the patient’s blood is healthy or vitiated by bile, the physician should conclude that the blood is healthy if a sample of it is eaten by a dog or a crow etc., but if it is not eaten then it is a case of hemothermia. In this manner, the physician should make his inferences concerning the state of the rest of the patient’s body fluids
7-(4) As regards the smells in the entire body of the patient, whether they are normal or abnormal, the physician should examine them by the sense of smell
7-(5). He should examine the normal or abnormal feel of the patient’s body by his hand i.e. by palpation
7. Thus, we have laid down the various methods of examination by means of direct observation, inference and instruction.
Investigation by inference
8. The following data are also to be gleaned by the method, of inference. Thus, the digestive fire is to be deter mined by the patient’s power of digestion, strength by his capacity for exercise, sense-organs like ear etc,, by their clarity of perception, the mind by the power of concentration, the understanding by the purposeful nature of the action, passion by the strength of attachment, infatuation by the lack of understanding, auger from actions of violence, grief by despondency, joy by exhilaration, pleasure from the sense of satisfaction, fear from dejection, fortitude from courage, vitality by the enthusiasm for undertaking, resolution by the absence of vacillation, faith by opinion, intelligence by the power of comprehension, the wits by correct recognition, memory by the power of recollection modesty by bashfulness, character by conduct, aversion by refusal, evil intention by subsequent performance, firmness by the restlessness, docility by compliance; age predilection, homologation and etiological factor by the stage of life, residence, homologatory signs and the type of pain respectively; disease with latent symptoms by testing with therapeutic or provocative medication, the degree of morbidity by the intensity of the provocative factors, the imminence of death by the severity of the fatal prognostic signs, the expectation of recovery from wholesome inclinations and the clarity of mind from the absence of disorder. As regards the hard bowelled condition or soft-bowelled condition, the dreams seen, the cravings, the likes and dislikes, pleasure and pain—these are to be known by interrogating the patient.
Investigation by All Three methods conducive to indubitable results
Here are verses again—
9. The discerning physician should correctly diagnose diseases by the aid of theoretical knowledge, by all the three means of testimony, direct observation and inference.
10. Having considered all factors and from all points of view, as far as is possible, the learned physician should, thereafter, formulate his opinion, first as regards the nature of the disease and next as regards the line of treatment.
11. The man who knows the nature of the disease and its line of treatment, is never at a loss concerning the appropriate application. Being un-confused he reaps the reward which comes of clear understanding.
12. The learned physician who is unable to win his way into the patient’s heart by the light of his scientific understanding is not entitled to treat disease.
Summary
Here are the two recapitulatory verses—
13. The three-fold means of knowledge, the diagnosis of the characteristics of all diseases, what things are taught by way of instruction by the sages, what by direct observation;
14. and what by the method of inference—all this has the high-souled sage given out in this chapter on the Specific Determination of the Three Methods of Diagnosis.
4 Thus in the Section on Specific Determination of Measure in the treatise compiled by Aguivesha and revised by Caraka, the fourth chapter entitled “The Specific Determination of the Measure of the special knowledge of the Three Methods of Diagnosis (trividha-roga-vishesha-vijnana—roga-viśeṣa-vijñāna)” is completed.
General description
3. There is as much functional diversity in the systems of circulation [i.e., srotas] in the human body as there is elemental diversity in the structural composition of the body. None of the elements in the body can flourish or decay independently of the channels of circulation. It is indeed these channels that by conveying the body-elements, which are undergoing metabolic processes, subserve the purpose of circulation.
4. There are some who go to the extent of saying that man is nothing but a mass of circulatory channels since they pervade the whole body and also since they are the carriers of what excites and what allays the humors But this is without doubt an over-statement; for, obviously, there are other things in the body than the channels alone; thus, there are the elements of which the channels are made, the elements which they carry, and the tissues to which they serve as carriers and the regions they cover; all this is something apart from channels.
5. Because of their multitudinousness, some are inclined to believe that they are innumerable; others again think that they are definitely numerable.
6-(1). From among these channels of circulation [i.e., srotas] we shall single out some that are the most prominent and describe them with reference to their extension and pathological characteristics. This will serve as guidance to the intelligent physician for inferring what is left unmentioned and. will be quite, sufficient for the ordinary practitioner.
6-(2). It is in this way. These, then, are the prominent channels, carrying severally the currents of life-breaths, water, food, nutritional juice blood, flesh, fat, bone-forming element, marrow, semen, urine, feces and sweat. As regards the three humors, Vata, Pitta and Kapha which traverse the whole body they move through all these systems of circulation [i.e., srotas]; while with regard to intellection etc., which unlike the humors are not perceivable by the senses, the whole of the sentient body is both the vehicle and the field of operation.
6. As long as these channels are in a condition of health, so long the whole body is free from disorders.
The source of the channels bearing the Life-breaths and other Body-elements
7. Among the prominent channels, the region enclosing the heart and the central cavity is the zone of the channels that carry the life-breaths. When diseased, these passages evince the following characteristic symptoms. Thus, if the respiration is too long, restricted, agitated or becomes shallow or short, or is frequently stertorous and painful, it should be concluded that the respiratory passages have undergone pathological changes.
8-(1). Of the channels that carry the aqueous element, the zone, is the region extending from the palate to the Kloman; when affected with morbidity they evince the following characteristic symptoms Thus, on observing the dryness of the tongue, palate, lips, the throat and the Kloman, and the inordinate nature of the thirst, it should be concluded that the water-carrying channels have undergone pathological changes.
8-(2). Of the channels that carry the ingested food, the zone is the region comprising the gastrum and the left side When affected with morbidity, they present the following characteristic symptoms Thus, on observing disinclination for food, inappetence and mis-digestion and a tendency to vomit, it should be concluded that the channels carrying ingested food have undergone pathological changes
8 (3). Of the channels that carry the nutrient body-fluid, the heart and the ten arteries comprise the zone Of the channels that convey the blood, the liver and the spleen comprise the zone. Of the channels that carry the flesh-forming element, the muscles and the skin comprise the zone. Of the channels that carry the fat-forming element the kidneys and the Vapa vahana comprise the zone. Of the channels that carry the bone-forming element, the adipose tissues and buttocks comprise the zone Of the channels that carry the marrow, the bones. and the joints comprise the zone, Of the channels that carry the semen, the testes and the phallus comprise the zone. As regards the characteristic symptoms produced, when the channels carrying the body nutrient fluid etc., are affected with morbidity, they have been described in the chapter on the various kinds of foods and drinks (chapter XXV Sūtrasthāna; for whatever characteristic symptoms are laid down with reference to morbidity of the body elements, are also observed in the morbid condition of the corresponding body channels. Of the urinary passages, the bladder and the kidneys comprise the zone. When affected with morbidity, they evince the following characteristic symptoms. Thus, on observing a man passing excessive or obsterpated, provoked scanty, constantly dribbling or thick urine, or micturiting painfully, one should conclude that the urinary passages have undergone pathological changes
8-(4). Of the channels carrying the fecal matter, the colon and the rectum comprise the zone. When these are affected with morbidity, the following characteristic symptoms are produced. On observing the patient passing scanty stools with sound and pain, or stools that are very watery or scybalous or copious, one should conclude that the channels carrying
8. Of the channels carrying perspiration, the adipose tissue and the hair-follicles comprise the zone. When these are affected with morbidity, the following characteristic symptoms are produced. On observing anhydrosis, hyper-hydrosis, roughness or excessive smoothness of the body, general burning sensation and horripilation, one should conclude the sweat channels to have undergone pathological changes.
Synonyms for Body-channels
9-(1).
—Such are the names by which the visible and invisible spaces occurring in the body-elements are known.
Vitiated channels Vitiate the Body-elements;
[Vata, Pitta and Kapha, the vitiating Factors of All elements]
9-(2). In the event of their vitiation, both the stationary and mobile elements of the body get vitiated, the vitiation spreading from the one to the other. The vitiated body-channels spread the corruption to other bodychannels alone and the vitiated bodyelements to other body-elements whereas the three humors—Vata, Pitta and Kapha if vitiated pollute the entire organism, being, as they are of a vitiating nature.
Causes for the Vitiation of the Channels
Here are verses again—
10. The channels carrying the lifebreaths get vitiated as the result of wasting, suppression of the body-urges, dehydration, exercise done while hungry, starvation and other violations of the laws of health.
11. The channels carrying the aqueous element get vitiated as the result of heat, indigestion, fright, excessive drinking, eating of very dry foods and excessive thirst.
12. The alimentary canal gets vitiated as the result of over-eating, eating untimely or unwholesome meals and from impairment of the digestive fire.
13. The channels of assimilation or of the nutritional juice get vitiated in consequence of eating heavy, cold and very unctuous substances in immoderate quantities and by worrying over-much.
14. The channels carrying the blood get vitiated as the result of indulgence in foods and drinks that are irritant, unctuous, hot and liquid, aud of. excessive exposure to the heat of the sun and fire the fecal matter have undergone pathological changes.
15. The channels conveying the flesh-forming element get vitiated in consequence of taking deliquescent, large and heavy articles of diet and by sleeping in the day after meals.
16. The channels conveying the fat-forming element get vitiated in consequence of lack of exercise, sleeping in the day, excessive consumption of fats ana over-indulgence in Varuni wine.
17. The channels conveying the bone-forming element get vitiated as the result of over-exercise, concussion and violent flexions and from indulgence in Vata-promoting factors.
18. The channels carrying the marrow-forming element get vitiated in consequence of the crushing of bones, liquefaction, injuries and compression, and from indulgence in incompatible diet.
19. The channels conveying the semen get vitiated as the result of untimely coitus or unnatural sex-act, suppression of the sexual urge, excessive indulgence in the sex-act and from the effects of surgical instruments, alkali and heat.
20. The channels conveying the urine get vitiated from the drinking water and indulging in eatables and women while under the urge to urinate, from the retention of urine by one is emaciated or injured in the urinary passages.
21. The channels concerning the feces get vitiated by suppression of the urge for defecation, by eating in excess anu eating pre-digestion meals aud in one whose digestive power is weak or who is emaciated.
21. The channels conveying the sweat get vitiated by over-exercise, by excessive exposure to heat, by indiscriminate indulgence in cold and heat, and from auger grief and fear.
23. In general all food and activity that are promotive of the morbid tendencies of the humors and deleterious to the body-elements are vitiative of the body-channels.
General symptoms of the Vitiation of the Channels
24. The characteristics of the morbidity of the body-channels are the increase or decrease of the flow of their contents, knotted condition of the passages, or flow of their contents in abnormal channels.
The Natural condition of the channels
25. The body-channels when normal are in every case of the color of the element they carry, tubular, either large or minute, elongated or reticulated in appearance.
Treatment in a Nut shell, of vitiated Channels
26’ In the vitiated condition of the channels that carry the life-breaths, water and food, the line of treatment is, in due order, that indicated for diseases of the respiratory organs, disorders of thirst and chyme disorders.
27. In the vitiated condition of the channels that carry the other body-elements, the line of treatment is that laid down in the section on dietetics with reference to the body-elements themselves.
28. As regards the vitiated condition of the channels that convey the urine feces and sweat, the line of treatment is, in due order that indicated for dysuria, diarrhea and fever.
Summary
Here are the recapitulatory verses—
23. The zones of the thirteen main channels of the body; the general indication of their vitiation; their synonyms in the medical science, the manner in which the body-channels and body elements vitiate each other on contact.
30. The causes of vitiation in each case; the line of treatment in brief, as also at the outset, the truth concerning man as a conglomeration of channels—all this, is laid down in this chapter on Specific Determination of the Measure of the Systems of Circulation.
31 He, who understands the entire body in all its aspects and all the bodily disorders, is never confused in the matter of treatment.
5. Thus, in the section on Specific Determination of Measure in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the fifth chapter entitled “The Specific Determination of the Measure of the Systems of Circulation (srotas-vimana)” is completed.
Numerability and otherwise of Diseases
4-(1). This statement (viz., that disease is both one and many) is not open to the charge of self-contradiction, because there is really no contradiction in a set of numerical operators a knitting of various groupings. Since there is thus no contradiction, the statement made above is not faulty.
4-(2). A classifier may classify a subject admitting of classification in one particular way. Re-classifying his subject over and over again with reference to other differentiating factors he is able to Achieve a fresh classification each time. A subsequent classification does not repudiate the validity of the previous one.
4-(3). Although the classifications may appear similar as regards number, yet in the light of the nature of other differentiating factors, they are, in fact, different
4. Different things are denoted by the same term and conversely the same tiling is denoted by various synonymous terms. Thus the term morbidity is applied to the disordered humors as well as to diseases. The disordered humors are given the names of morbidity, disease or ailment, vitiated nature and disorder; and similarly the diseases too, are spoken of as disease, ailment, vitiated nature and disorder. Among these appellations, that of “Morbidity” is the generic term common alike to morbid humors and diseases. The differentiating factors may be different.
Innumerabiiity of Diseases and Numeral-lity of Morbific conditions
5-(1). Now, the diseases are innumerable, there being an unlimited number of them- The morbific humors on the contrary, are strictly numerable there being a limited number of them. Accordingly we shall now enter on a complete exposition of the morbific factors instancing some of the main disorders induced by them.
The two Psychic Disease-factors and their products
5-(2). Rajas (passion) and Tamas (ignorance) are the morbific factors affecting the mind. Among the disorders brought about by these two are: desire, anger, greed, infatuation, envy, conceit, arrogance, anxiety, remorse, fear, exhilaration etc.
The Somatic Disease-factors
5. Vata, Pitta and Kapha are the morbific factors affecting the body. Among the disorders engendered by these three morbid humors are fever, diarrhea, edema, consumption, dyspnea, urinary anomalies and dermatosis etc.
The three kinds of exciting factors
6 Of both kinds of morbific factors (Psychic and somatic), the exciting factors are three. They are—non-homologatory contact of the senses with their sense-objects, volitional transgression and time-effect.
7. These morbific factors when excited, generate by virtue of the diversity of exciting factors and the diversity of susceptible factors, innumerable varieties of disorders.
The Inter-relation between both
8. These disorders both psychic such as desire etc., and somatic such as fever etc., following one another, occasionally occur together.
9 The natural concurrence between passion and ignorance is invariable. For ignorance cannot act in the absence of passion.
10. Of the morbific factors which have the same habitat, the discordance that occurs may extend to all the three humors or to any two of them by reason of their common morbific tendency. The morbid conditions are of the nature of the morbific factors.
Morbid condition Varying with Associated Affections
11-(1). The differential characteristics of primary and secondary, affections arc as follows: The primary condition is that which is independent, manifests definite symptoms and has an onset and subsistence as laid down. The secondary affection is th:t which is contrary to this description.
11-(2). If all the three provoked humors are accompanied by signs of secondary affections, it is called ‘tri-discordance’; if only two of the humors are affected, the condition is called bi-discordance
11. From this distinction, of primary and secondary affections, there proceed the various groupings of morbid humors. Thus come about the classifications of the various causative factors as set out in the nomenclature of physicians with reference to morbific humors and diseaseconditions.
The Four Types of Gastric fire
12-(1). The thermal clement in the body is differentiated into four types according to its intensity.
12-(2). Thus, it is found to be acute, mild, regular and irregular. Among these, the acute type is capable of coping with all kinds of indiscretions; of a contrary nature to this is the mild type. The regular type is that which becomes impaired by indiscretions, but in the absence of indiscretions, maintains its normal condition; the irregular is that which is of the opposite characteristics to the last.
12-(3) These four types of thermal elements are seen in the four types of men.
12. In persons with equipoised Vata-Pitta-Kapha habitus, when in their normal condition, the thermal processes are of the normal type. In persons with Vata habitus, if the preponderant Vata has overpowered the seat of heat, the thermal processes become of the irregular type. In persons of the Pitta habitus if the preponderant Pitta has overpowered the seat of heat, the thermal processes become of the acute type. In persons of Kapha habitus, if the preponderant Kapha has overpowered the seat of heat, the thermal processes become of the mild type.
The Nature of Habitus as Vata etc.
13-(1). Some object here that there are no human beings with the equipoised condition of Vata-Pitta-Kapha, as men are given to a dietary made up of miscellaneous articles. In consequence of this, some persons tend to be of the Vata habitus, some of the Pitta habitus and some of the Kapha habitus
13-(2). This position, however, is not tenable. Why is it not tenable? Because of the following consideration. It is the men in whom the three humors—Vata, Pitta and Kapha are equally balanced that the physicians describe as being healthy. Since balance or concordance of humors is health, and since it is for the sake of health that medicine is used, and since the use of medicine is resorted to as a desideratum, therefore, it follows, from all this, that there are men with the equipoised habitus of Vata, Pitta, Kapha and there is no such thing as a Vata norm, a Pitta norm or a Kapha norm
13. On account of the preponderance of this or that humor in a man, he is spoken of, for convenience, as belonging to this or that humoral habitus; but there is no question of such a type being considered as normal as it is definitely an abnormal condition, the humors being aggravated. Therefore, these different types of habitus cannot be said to exist as representing the normal condition of health. There are, to be sure, persons with a preponderance of Vata, Pitta or Kapha humor but these are to be known as departures from the normal condition.
14-(1) For these four classes of men there are four different kinds of regimen which are beneficial.
14. For those who evince the balanced condition of the three humors, the regimen too, is of the balanced type As regards the remaining three who suffer from the preponderance of one or the other of the humors, three distinct regimens that are antagonistic to the preponderant humors are devised for their benefit, keeping in view the particular humoral excess which has to be corrected. These regimens are to be observed till the thermal processes have returned to the normal. Once they have become normal, a regimen of moderation should be followed. Whatever else, by way of medicine, contributes to this end—all that, is the desideratum we shall now explain at length.
15 All the three following types of men are to be regarded as diseased, although in the opinion of the physicians belonging to another school of thought, they are not to be so regarded. They are: persons of the Vata type, the Pitta type and the Kapha type. The special characteristics of these three types are as follows:—The Vata disorders in the case of the Vata type, the Pitta disorders in the case of the Pitta type and the Kapha disorders in the case of the Kapha type are more liable to occur and in greater severity.
16 -(1). If a person of the Vata habitus who is given to indulgence in Vata-provoking things, the Vata is really aggravated; not so the other two humors Thus exacerbated, the Vata afflicts its victim’s body with the disorders mentioned and impairs his strength, complexion ease and span of life.
16. The following measures are indicated to counteract and subdue the condition. Oleation and sudation in the prescribed manner; mild purifications with unctuous, hot, sweet, sour, and salt medication; dietary articles of a similar character; inunction, poultices, bandages, friction, affusions, immersion-bath, hand-massage, kneading, shock-therapy, surprise-therapy, de-memorising therapy, prescriptions of wines and spirits, unctuous substances derived from various sources and medicated with digestive stimulants, digestives, correctives of Vata and purgatives and which have been prepared a hundred times or a thousand times and rendered worthy of use in every way; enemata, the regimen that goes with enemata and habituation to the comforts of life.
17-(1). Similarly, in the Pitta patient who is given to the indulgence of Pitta-provoking things, the Pitta is readily aggravated; not so the other two humors. Thus exacerbated, the Pitta afflicts its victim’s body with the disorders mentioned, tending to impair his strength, complexion, ease and his span of life.
17. To counteract and subdue such a condition the following measures should be taken:—potion of ghee; oleation procedure with ghee; purgation; use of medicines and food-stuffs that are sweet, bitter, astringent and refrigerant; use of scents which are mild, sweet, fragrant, cooling and cordial; wearing on the chest of necklaces of pearls and gems which have been kept in ice-cold water; frequent sprinkling of water mixed with white sandal, Roxburg’s five-leaved tree of beauty, yellow sandal wood, lotus stalks and cooled by wind and sprinkling of water from drenched blue lotuses, night lotuses, sacred lotuses and fragrant lotuses; listening to songs and the playing of musical instruments, which are pleasing to the ears, mild, sweet and agreeable; listening to edifying talk; keeping the company of well-wishers, keeping also the company of agreeable women, wearing cool garments and garlands; residence in palatial mansions cooled by the rays of the moon and exposed to breezes blowing from every direction; camping in the interior of mountains, or on river banks or staying in cooled rooms, the use of cool raiment and of cool breezes from fans; resorting to delightful pleasure gardens through which blow pleasant, cool and fragrant breezes; the use of nosegays of lotuses, blue lotuses; dark lotuses, moon lotuses, fragrant lotuses. White lotuses, and king lotuses and the use in general of all sootbing-things.
18-(1). Similarly, in the person of the Kapha habitus given to indulgence in Kapha-provoking things, the Kapha is readily aggravated; not so the other two humors. Thus exacerbated, the Kapha afflicts its victim’s body with the disorders already mentioned, tending to impair his strength, complexion, ease and span of life.
18. To counteract and subdue such a condition the following, therapeutic measures are indicated:—the systematic use of the purificatory procedures with acute and hot articles, the use of dietary which is for the most part of a dry nature and has been treated with pungent, bitter and astringent ingredients; as also running, jumping, leaping, whirling, about, walking, wrestling, sexual congress, exercise, massage, baths and oily, massage; particularly the drinking of strong wines of old vintage, lightening therapy of all kinds, in conjunction with the use of smoking; the wearing of warm apparel and the giving up of the comforts of life with a view to eventual happiness.
The qualifications for the Kind’s physicianship
Here is a yerse again—
19.The man who is, acquainted with the characteristics of all diseases, versed in all therapeutic measures aud conversant with the true properties of all drugs, is worthy of being made the custodian of the king’s life.
Summary
Here are the recapitulatory verses—
20-22. The classification of disease-groups arising from the difference in their nature etc., the reconciliation of the seeming contradiction involved in classifying diseases variously; the homogeneity of disease and the humoral fault; the enumeration of the morbific factor (psychic and somatic); partial enumeration of the morbid conditions; the manner in which the humors get aggravated; exposition of the thermal element; the method of maintaining the thermal processes; the therapeutic measures for restoring those suffering from the excess of a particular humor to normality; all this, has been set out by the great sage in the chapter on Specific Detefmination of the Measure of Disease-groups.
6. Thus, in the Section on Speclip Determination of Measure in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the sixth chapter entitled “The Specific Determination of the Measure of Nosology (roganika-vimana—rogānīka)” is completed.
Knowledge of the Acute or Mild condition of Disease Essential for Treatment
4-(1). A full conception of the: science; will never-be attained by the knowledge of only a part of it.
4-(2). Those who are. really mistaken in. the diagnosis of the disease will also be misled in deciding the line of treatment. When the inexperienced physicians diagnose a patient suffering from a major disease as one suffering from a minor one, they thinking the. morbidity to be slight; give mild purificatory treatment to the patient at the time of purification and thus they provoke the morbid humors the more.
4-(3). Or, when they diagnose a patient suffering from a minor, malady as one suffering from a major disease, then the physicians, thinking the morbidity to be intensive, give strong purificatory medication at the time of purification, then, they eliminate forcibly even the normal humors and emaciate the body of the patient.
4-(4). Thus, believing to have perfect approach to the whole subject by the. knowledge of one branch only, the physicians blunder.
4.The physicians, knowing all that is to be known examining every thing in every respect possible and diagnosing after full investigation, will never be mistaken and will be able to achieve the desired result.
Here are verses again:—
5. The inept physicians who make their diagnosis by merely looking at the patient are mistaken in diagnosing the severity or slightness of the disease, because they diagnose without reference to the condition of his mind etc.
6. Being deluded by a misconception of the nature of the disease they administer wrongful medication, which either kills the patient or brings down upon him great affliction.
7. But the wise, ascertaining in every way everything that is to be examined will never blunder in the proper line of treatment.
8. Thus, having listened to the exposition of the determination of disease from the external appearance of the patient, the two types of the external appearance of the patients, their cause, their leading to mistaken diagnosis, the cause and evil results of the mistaken diagnosis the correct diagnosis, its cause and good results, Agnivesha, touching the feet of the worshipful Atreya, then, asked concerning the characteristics of all kinds of parasites infecting the human body, their cause, habitat, form, color, name, effects and treatment
The Varieties of Parasites
9. The worshipful Atreya replied to him, “O, Agnivesha! twenty varieties of pathogenic parasites in addition to normal one in the body have been described classified into different groups in a previous chapter (chap XIX Sūtrasthāna). Again when classified according to their source, they are of four kinds. They are born of the feces, born of the kapha, born of blood and born of the body excretion.
10. The excretion is external and internal. Those which are produced in external excretion are said to be born of excretion. Their cause is lack of cleanliness. Their habitat is the hair on the head, face body, eye-lashes and clothes. Their form is minute, Til-shaped and multipedal. Their color is black or white. Their names are ‘lice’ and ‘nits.’ Their effect is the causing of itching and production of wheals and pimples on the body. Their treatment consists in their removal together with the removal of the dirt on the body and in the avoidance of conditions leading to the formation of excretion.
11. The cause of the blood-born parasites, indeed, is similar to that causing dermatosis, Their habitat is blood-carrying vessel. Their form is minute, round, having no pedicle, some being too minute to be visible to the naked eye. Their color is coppery red. Their names are Keshada [Keśāda], Lomada [Lomāda], Lomadvipa [Lomadvīpa], Saurasa, Audumbara [Auḍumbara] and Jantumatara [Jantumātara]. Their effects are the destruction of the hair on the head, face and body, and of the nails and eye-lashes and when infesting the wound, they cause hyper esthesia, itching, pricking pain, creepy sensation, and when extensively developed they eat up the skin, vessels, muscles, flesh and cartilages. Their treatment is similar to that of dermatosis, which will be expounded in the subsequent chapters.
12-(l). Those born of Kapha are caused by milk, gur, til, fishes, flesh of wet-land animals, pasted articles of diet, milk pudding, oil of safflower (Kusumbha), eating pre-digestion meals, taking putrid and softened, promiscuous, antagonistic and unwholesome diet. Their habitat is the stomach, When fully grown they migrate upwards or downwards or both ways.
12. Their varieties, according to their shape and color, are as follows: some are whitish and in shape flat and big; others are cylindrical and of the shape of earth-worm (round worm) and of a white and coppery tinge; and some are minute, long and thread-like and white (thread-worm) The names of the three kinds of Kapha-born worms are Antrada [Antrāda], Udarada [Udarāda], Hridayacara [Hṛdayacara], Curu, Darbhapushpa [Darbhapuṣpa], Saugandhika and Mahaguda [Mahāguda]. Their effects are nausea, ptyalism, anorexia, indigestion, fever, fainting, yawning, sneezing, constipation, body-ache, vomiting, emaciation and roughness of the body.
13-(1). The worms born of the feces have the same causation as those born of Kapha. Their habitat is the colon. When they are fully grown, they migrate downwards, and if they then migrate towards the stomach, eructation and breath of the man give out the fecal smell.
13-(2). Their characteristic form and color are: some are minute, cylindrical and whitish, long, like a fibre of wool in appearance. Some are large, cylindrical, dusty, blue, green or yellow. Their names are Kakeruka, Makeruka, Leliha, Sashulaka [Saśūlaka], Sausurada [Sausurāda].
13. Their effects are: looseness of stools, emaciation, roughness and the manifestation of horripilation. They inhabit the anal region, and causing constant irritation in the anal orifice, give rise to pruritus; and when hyperactive they often come, out of the rectum. These are the characteristic causes of worms born of the Kapha and the feces.
Treatment in brief, of Diseases due to Parasites
14. We shall now expound bristly their treatment and later expound it in full detail. The extraction of all worms is to be done first, then the removal of the cause and the avoidance of etiological factors.
15-(1). Their extraction is done carefully either by the help of instrument or by the hand without the help of an instrument; and the extraction of the worms that are lying in their internal habitat is done by suitable internal medication, This is of four kinds viz., errhines, emesis, purgation and corrective enema. This is the mode of the extraction of worms.
15-(2). The removal of the cause of these is by the use of pungent, bitter astringent, alkaline and hot articles, and of whatever else is antagonistic to the susceptible condition of Kapha and the fecal matter. This is the removal of the cause.
15. Thereafter, the avoidance of all conditions laid down as etiological factors, also of other substances which are most likely to cause worms. Thus their treatment has been briefly described. The same will now be expounded in detail.
16-(1). The patient who suffers from worms in his gastrointestinal tract should first be prepared with oleation and sudation procedures for six or seven nights and on the day previous to the administration of the wormicidal purificatory medication, the patient should be given a meal consisting of milk, gur, curds, Til, fish, flesh of wet-land animals, pasted articles of diet, milk-pud ding and oil of safflower in the evening and early in the morning, for arousing the worms and causing them to return to the gastro-intestinal tract.
16. And after ascertaining that the patient has comfortably passed the previous night and the meal has been fully digested, he should be,, on that day, treated with corrective enema, emesis or purgation, if the patient has been found fit after thorough investigation of all the systems of his body.
17-(1) The physician should say. “Bring garden radish, white mustard, garlic, Indian beech, drumstick, seeds of drumstick, celery, ginger-grass, sal, holy basil, shrubby basil, Gandira [Gaṇḍīra], Kalamalaka [Kālamālaka], Parnasa [Parṇāsa], sneezewort anc. sweet marjoram. Bring all of these or whatever of them is available.” Then the physician should carefully examine the qualities of the drugs brought; they should be cut into small pieces, washed with water, placed in a well-cleaned vessel, and.soaked in cow’s urine diluted with half the quantity of water, and then boiled, and should be continuously stirred with a ladle; when most of the water and liquid part of the herbs have evaporated, the vessel should be removed from the fire and the decoction should be well-filtered. This decoction, while warm, mixed with oil and the paste of emetic nut, long pepper. and embelia and salted with salsoda salt, should be given to the patient systematically as corrective enema
17. Similarly, the decoction of mudar, mudar (Catagories procera), kurchi, pigeon pea, costus and curryleaf tree, or the decoction of drumstick, tooth brush tree, coriander, kurroa and white mustard or the decoction of Emblic myrobalan ginger, turmeric and neem mixed with the pasta of emetic nut and other ingredients, should be used in corrective enema for the period of three or seven nights.
18 (1). When the last enema has returned, the patient should be comforted and skilfully given to drink the purificatory medications acting both as purgatives and emetics.
18. Its mode of administration will now be expounded. The patient should be given to drink the decoction of the emetic nut and long pepper in a dose of 8 tolas mixed with 1 tola of turpeth-paste. This will eliminate satisfactorily the inorbid elements from either channel. In the same way the physician carefully considering all special factors, skilfully combining the various emetic and purgative drugs mentioned in the Section on Pharmaceutics, should give the-, patient the decoction to drink.
19-(1). knowing the patient to be well purged, he should be affused with genially warm decoction of embelia in the afternoon
19-(2). All daily routine of external and internal ablutions should be performed with this decoction alone. In the absence of this decoction, the patient should be affused with decoction of drugs of pungent, bitter and astringent groups or with cow’s urine mixed with barley alkali etc.
19. After the affusion, he should be removed to a room free from draughts and be should be gradually given the diet of medicated gruels etc., prepared with long pepper, roots of long pepper, chaba pepper, leadwort and ginger. When the stage for the administration of thick gruel is reached, he should be given two or three oil-enemata with embelia oil on alternate days.
20. If the physician thinks that the parasites infecting the head have greatly increased and some of them are creeping in the head, then treating the head with preliminary oleation and sudation procedure's, the head should be purged by errhines such as seeds of rough chaff and other drugs,
21-(1). Now, we shall describe in detail the articles of diet and drugs to be taken internall which will cotinter the causative factors of helminthiasis.
21 (2). Take drumstick root and branch, cut it into small pieces, pound it in a mortar, and take out the juice by manual pressure and mix this juice with the flour of red Shali rice, make it into a pan-cake and bake it on smokeless cinders and smearing it with embelia-oil and salt, give it to the patient suffering from helminthiasis to eat. Thereafter he should be made to drink the sour conjee or semi-diluted buttermilk, mixed with the groups of the five drugs beginning with long pepper, added with salt.
21. Along this method of preparation, pan-cakes may be prepared with the juice of any of the following drugs—trailing eclipta, mudar, crested purple naildye, cadamba, black chaste tree, sal, holy basil, shrubby basil, Gandira, Kalamalaka, Parnasa, sneezewort, sweet marjoram, bakul, kurchi and hiritz, or similarly pancakes may be prepared from the juice of plantain, chiretta, turpeth root, emblic, chebulic and beleric myrobalans; and the patient should be given to drink the juice of these drugs either singly or in combinations of two or alt combined mixed with honey, early in the morning and on an empty stomach.
22. Taking horse-dung, spread it wide on a mat and dry it in the sun. Then crushing it in a mortar and again pounding it into fine powder upon a stone slab and impregnating it eight or ten times with the decoction of embelia or the three myrobalans, dry it in sunshine; when it is well impregnated pulverise it into very fine powder on a stone slab and put it into a new earthen vessel; it should then be laid by in a safe place. One tola of this powder or whatever dose is considered good should be given well mixed with honey as a linctus to the patient suffering from helminthiasis,
23-(1). Secondly, taking 1024 tolas of the stones of marking nuts, crush them and put them in a jug which is strong, impregnated with oil, perforated with many minute holes at the base, wrapt all over and pasted with clay, and cover it with a lid and place it (mouth downwards) over another jug which is strong, impregnated with oil similarly and buried in the ground upto its neck. Pile all around it cowdung cakes and ignite. When it is seen that the dung-cakes have been burnt and the stones of the marking nut have been drained of their oil, then the upper jug should be removed.
23.Take the oil collected in the lower jug, mix it with half its amount of the powder of embelia seeds and keep it in the sun for the whole day. This oil should be given as potion in proper dose. By this the patient gets purged satisfactorily. Post purgation treatment is to be given as laid down In the same way the oils of deodar and long leaved pine should be prepared and be given in the form of potion
24. And then the patient should be administered unctuous enemata at the.right time.
25. The physician should say, “Bring the Autumnal Til which is fresh and rich.” Taking it, cleanse it well, wash and throw it in tepid decoction of embelia and keep it in the decoction till the impurities have been drained out. On finding it well cleaned, remove the husk and again clean it well and wash and impregnate it well twenty-one times with the decoction of embelia. After drying it in the sunshine, crush it in a mortar and reduce into fine powder on a stone slab. Put the powder into an earthen vessel and soaking it frequently with the decoction of embelia, rub it well with the hands. By this compression with the hands whatever oil comes out should be collected with the hand in a clean strong earthen jug and kept in a safe place.
26-(1). The physician should say, “Do thus; 4 tolas each of the pulp of lodh and Uddalaka should, be finely pasted in the decoction of embelia. Then take half its [measure?] of the pulp of black turpeth and turpeth, half the measure again of the pulp of red physic nut and physic nut and half the measure again of chaba pepper and white flowered leadwort. This mixture of pulps should be mixed with 128 tolas of the decoction of embelia. Adding to this 64 tolas of the prepared oil, the whole mixture should be well-stirred. Then it should be placed in a big pan which should be placed on the fire for boiling. The pharmacist then should sit in a convenient position, and watching the boiling process of the oil all the time, should keep stirring constantly with a ladle and thus prepare it on a low fire.
26-(2). When it is found that the bubbling has ceased and the foam has subsided and the oil has become clear and acquired the desired odor, color and taste, and when rubbed between the fingers the preparation is found to be neither too soft nor too Lard and does not stick to the fingers but gets rolled like a wick, then it is time to take off the oil-pan from the fire.
26-(3). After taking it off from the fire, it should be allowed to cool down. Filtered with a new cloth it should be placed in a clean, strong earthen jug covered with a lid and wrapt [wrapped?] round with a. white piece of cloth, tied well with a twine and should be put in a safe place.
26 (4). The patient should be given the potion in proper doses whereby he gets satisfactorily purged, After the patient has thus been well purified, the after-treatment should be given as laid down. The patient should be given an unctuous enema at the right time in such procedure.
26. Preparing in the same manner the oils of rape-seed, linseed, Indian beech and bitter luffa, the physician examining all the characteristics of the patient, should administer those oils as indicated. As a result of this the patient becomes free from disease.
27-(1). Thus, the etiological factors, shape, color, name, effect and treatment of worms born of Kapha and feces have been described in general.
27-(2). In particular, the treatment of worms is to be done by small doses of medications, mostly in the form of corrective and unctuous enemata and purgation (downward elimination); and the treatment of worms born of Kapha is to be done by big doses of these medications, mostly in the form of errhines, emesis and sedation. Thus the process of helminthicidal medication has been described. While carrying out this line of treatment one should try to avoid the respective causative factors.
27. Thus the treatment of the gastro-intestinal helminthiasis has been duly described
Here are verses again—
28-29. Extraction is indeed said to be the first medication for worms, then comes the removal of the cause and thereafter the avoidance of etiological factors. This threefold line of treatment which has been just described regarding worms is indeed equally applicable in the treatment of all diseases.
30. Purification, sedation and avoi dance of causative factors—these ought to be observed by a physician in each and every disease, systematically.
Summary
Here are the two recapitulatory verses—
31-32. The two kinds of diseased persons, the skilled and unskilled physicians, the purpose of their description, the twenty varieties of parasites, their description in seven parts such as cause, habitat etc.,—all this is narrated in this chapter entitled “The Specific Determination of the disease by the appearance of the patient”, in the Section on Specific Determination by the great sage, for the enlightenment of students as also for the cure of the disease.
7. Thus, in the Section on Specific Determination of Measure in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the seventh chapter entitled “The Specific Determination of the Measure of the Disease from the Appearance of the Patient (vyadhita-rupin—vyādhita-rūpin)” is completed.
Selection of Texts
3-(1). The intelligent man who after an appraisal of the task whether it will prove heavy or light for him, of the rewards, the obligations, time and place, finds himself suited for the medical profession [i.e., bhiṣaj], should first of all select a treatise of that science.
3-(2). Many treatises of medicine are current in the world. From among these he should choose that treatise which has obtained great popularity and is approved by wise men, which is comprehensive in scope, held in esteem by those who are worthy of credence, suitable alike for the understanding of the three grades of students (highly intelligent, moderate and low), free from the faults of repetition, revealed by a seer, arranged in well-made aphorisms, commentary and summary, well authenticated, free from vulgar usages and difficult words, rich in synonyms, possessing words of traditionally accepted sense, concerned mainly with determining the true nature of things, relevant to the theme, orderly in its arrangement of topics, rapidly elucidating and enriched with definitions and illustrations, Such a treatise is to be chosen.
3. For, such a treatise, like the unclouded sun, dispelling darkness, illuminates everything.
Selection of the Teacher
4-(1). Thereafter the aspirant shall look about for the teacher.
4-(2). He should be one who is thoroughly versed both in theory and practice, who is skilful, upright, pure, deft of hand, well equipped, possessed of all his faculties, who is conversant with human nature and the line of treatment, who possesses special insight into the science, who is free from self-conceit, free from envy, free from irascibility, endowed with fortitude, who is affectionate towards his pupils, proficient in reading and skilful in exposition.
4. The teacher endowed with such qualities equips quickly the good disciple with all the qualities of a physician, just as the rain-clouds at the proper season endow the fertile field with the best of crops
5-(1). Approaching such a teacher, with a view to winning his favour, one should wait on him vigilantly as on the sacrificial fire, as on a god, as ou the king, as on the father, and as on one’s patron.
5.Then having, through his kindness, received the whole science, the student should, for the sake of strengthening his understanding, strive constantly and well to perfect himself in his grasp of nomenclature, the interpretation of their meaning and in the power of exposition.
6. To this end, we shall indicate the means viz., study, teaching and discussion with those versed in the same subject. These are the means.
The Method of Study
7. Now the method of study is this:—The student who is healthy and has consecrated all his time for study should rise at dawn or while yet a portion of the night is left, and having performed the necessary ablutions and having saluted the gods, the seers, the cows, the Brahmanas, the guardians, the elders, the adepts and the teachers, and seating himself at ease on even and clean ground, should, concentrating his mind, go over the aphorisms in order, repeating them over and over again, all the while understanding their import fully, in order to correct his own faults of reading as also to recognise the measure of faults in the reading of others. In this manner, at noon, in the aftt moon and in the night, ever vigilant, the student should apply himself to study. This is the method of study.
8-(1). Now for the method of teaching. The teacher who has underta ken to impart instruction should, before all else, test the candidate
The Qualities in a Student
8. He should be peaceful, noble in disposition, not given to mean acts, straight of eye, face and nose, slender, red and clean of tongue, flawless in teeth and lips, not possessing an indistinct and nasal voice, persevering, free from egotism, intelligent, endowed with the powers of reasoning and memory, liberal minded, suited to the study either by inheritance or by aptitude, devoted to truth, perfect of body, endowed with unimpaired sense faculties, modest, gentle, capable of understanding the nature of things, not irritable, free from addictions of any kind, endowed with character and purity, conduct, affection, skilfulness, courtesy and study, who has single-minded devotion to knowledge both of theory and practical work, who is free from covetousness and sloth, who is desirous of the welfare of all creatures, obedient to all the instructions of his teacher and who is attached to him One, who is endowed with all these qualities, is considered to be fit for receiving instruction.
The Ceremony of initiation
9.The teacher should address himself to the disciple who has thus come to him desiring to study and who sits close in reverential mood, and say unto him, “Come and sit at my feet for instruction, in the northern solstice of the year, in the bright half of the month, on an auspicious day, when the moon is in conjunction with the constellation of Pushya or Hasta or Shravana or the Ashvins, and in an auspicious Karana and Muhurta having taken the tonsure (ritual shave), having fasted and bathed and clad in brown garment, bringing in your hands fragrant articles and dry twigs, fire, ghee, sandal paint and water pots, also flower-garlands, a lamp, gold, ornaments of gold, silver, precious stones, pearls and corals, silken garments, sacrificial stakes, also holding in your hand the sacrificial grass, fried paddy, white mustard seeds, white rice grains and flowers strung in garlands as well as loose, and pure articles of food as also rubbed sandal pasted
10, Even so should the disciple do
11. When he has thus approached awaiting hig behests, the teacher should select an even clean plot of ground, sloping towards the east or the north and which is four cubits square, besmeared with cowdung water, spread with the sacred grass, and bounded on all sides by sacrificial stakes It must then be adorned with the above-mentioned sandal paste, pots of water, silken garments, gold, ornaments of gold, silver, precious stones, pearls and coral. Then should the offerings be made of holy articles of food, perfumes, white flowers, roasted paddy, mustard seeds and rice. Then igniting a fire on the place with the dry sticks of Palasha or zachum oil plant or gular fig tree or mahwa tree, he should seat himself facing the east, having made himself pure and ready for instruction and pour into the fire three libations of honey aud ghee accompanied by the recitation of holy verses prescribed. Then he should recite the sacred versts and uttering Swaha. pour libation to Brahma, Agni, Dhanvantari, Prajapati the Ashvin twins, Indra and the sacred sages, who are the authors of the aphorisms.
12. Then the disciple should do likewise. Having poured libations in the fire, he must go round it, keeping it to his right always. Then he must seek the blessings of the Brahman as and honour and worship the physicians [i.e., bhishaj] present.
The Oath of initiation
13-(1). The teacher then should instruct the disciple in the presence of the sacred fire, Brahmanas and physicians [i.e., bhishaj]—
13-(2), (saying) “Thou shalt lead the life of a bachelor (Brahmacārī), grow thy hair and beard, speak only the truth, eat no meat, eat only pure articles of food be free from envy and carry no arms. There shill be nothing that thou oughtest not do at my behest except hating the king or causing another’s death or committing an act of great unrighteousness or acts leading to calamity.
13-(3). Thou shalt dedicate thyself to me and regard me as tby chief. Thou shalt be subject to me and conduct thyself for ever for my welfare and pleasure. Thou shalt serve and dwell with me like a son or a slave or a supplicant. Thou shalt behave and act without arrogance and with care and attention, and with undistracted mind, humility, constant reflection and with ungrudging obedience. Acting either at my behest or otherwise, thou shalt conduct thyself for the achievement of thy teacher’s purposes alone, to the best of thy abilities.
13-(4). If thou desirest success, wealth and fame as a physician and heaven after death, thou shalt pray for the welfare of all creatures beginning with the cows and Brahmanas.
13-(5). Day and night, however thou mayest be engaged, thou shalt endeavor for the relief of patients with all thy heart and soul. Thou shalt not desert or injure thy patient even for the sake of thy life or thy living. Thou shalt not commit adultery even in thought. Even so, thou shalt not covet other’s possessions. Thou shalt be modest in -thy attire and appearance. Then shouldst not be a drunkard or a sinful man nor shouldst thou associate with the abettors of crimes. Thou shouldst speak words that are gentle, pure and righteous, pleasing, worthy, true, wholesome and moderate. Thy behaviour must be in consideration of time and place and heedful of past experience. Thou shalt act always with a view to the acquisition of knowledge and fullness of equipment.
13-(6). No persons, who are hated of the king or who are haters of the king or who are hated of the public or who are haters of the public, shall receive treatment. Similarly, those that are of very unnatural, wicked and miserable character and conduct, those who have not vindicated their honor and those that are on the point of death and similarly women who are unattended by their husbands or guardians shall not receive treatment.
13-(7). No offering of presents by woman without the behest of her husband or guardian shall be accepted by thee. While entering the patient’s house, thou shalt be accompanied by a man who is known to the patient and who has his permission to enter, and thou shalt be well-dad and bent of head, self-possessed, and conduct thyself after repeated consideration. Thou shalt thus properly make thy entry. Having entered, thy speech, mind, intellect and senses shall be entirely devoted to no other thought than that of being helpful to the patient and of things concerning him only. The peculiar customs of the patient’s household shall not be made public Even knowing that the patient‘s span of life has come to its close, it shall not be mentioned by thee there, where if so done, it would cause shock to the patient or to others
13. Though possessed of knowledge one should not boast very much cf one’s knowledge Most people are offended by the boastfulness of even those who are otherwise good and authoritative
14-(1). There is no limit at all to the “‘cience of Life’ So thou shouldst apply thyself to it with diligence. This is how thou shouldst act. Also thou shouldst learn the skill of practice from another without carping. The entire world is the teacher to the intelligent and the foe to the unintelligent. Hence, knowing this well, thou shouldst listen and act according to the words of instruction of even an unfriendly person, when they are worthy and such as bring fame to you and long life, and are capable of giving you strength and prosperity.”
14-(2). Thereafter, the teacher should say this—“Thou shouldst conduct thyself properly with the gods, the sacred fire, the twice-born, the guru, the aged, the adepts and the preceptors. If thou hast conducted thyself well with them, the precious stones, the grains and the gods become well-disposed towards thee. If thou shouldst conduct thyself otherwise, they become unfavourable to thee.
14. To the teacher that has thus spoken, the disciple should say ‘Even so’. If he behaves as instructed, he deserves to be taught; else, he does not deserve to be taught. The teacher
who teaches the worthy disciples will obtain all the auspicious fruits of teaching, those described and even others not described here and obtains all auspicious qualities for himself as well as for his disciple. Thus has been described the method of instruction
15-(1). We shall hereafter expound the method of discussion. A physician should discuss with another physician.
In Praise of Discussion
15.Discussion with a person of the same branch of science is indeed what makes for the increase of knowledge and happiness. It contributes towards the clarity of understanding, increases dialectical skill, broadcasts reputation, dispels doubts regarding things heard by repeated hearing, and confirms the ideas of those that have no doubts. It enables one to hear a few new things in the course of discussion. Sometimes, secret meanings which the teacher imparts to the ministering disciple in a propitious moment gradually, is revealed by the excited disputant, desirous of victory, in the process of discussion. Hence it is that discussion with men of the same branch of science, is applauded by the wise.
Two Kinds of Discussion
16. Such discussion with the men of the same branch of science is of two kinds—friendly discussion and the discussion of challenge or hostile discussion.
The. friendly method of Discussion
17-(1). The friendly discussion is enjoined with the person that is endowed with knowledge and experience, that is versed in the dialectics of statement and rejoinder, that does not get angered, that is possessed of special insight into the subject, that is not carping, that is easily persuaded, that is an adept in the art of persuasion, that has tolerance and pleasantness of speech.
17. Discussing with such a person, one should talk confidingly and even inquire confidingly. When one is questioned so confidingly, one must explain clearly the meaning to such a confiding inquirer. One should not be afraid of discomfiture. Having discomfited another, one should not rejoice. One should not boast before others. One should not get deluded by a partial or imperfect grasp of the subject. One should not expatiate on what the other is not at all acquainted with. One should persuade gently and in a spirit of goodness. One should pay great heed to this. This is the method of proper discussion
The Hostile method of Discussion
18-(1). Hereafter we shill describe the hostile method of discussion, in which a person may engage, knowing full-well his best points
18-(2). He must investigate beforehand the points of merit and demerit of the opponent and the difference, in excellence between himself and the opponent. He must investigate well the nature of the assembly.
18-(1). The adepts praise such investigation, for it determines the choice of a wise man’s action to engage or not to engage in a discussion. Hence it is that the wise praise such investigation
18-(4). It is indeed by examination that he can find out the superior and the inferior, the advantageous and the disadvantageous points of the disputant.
18-(5). They are—learning, experience, power of retention, originality or resourcefulness and eloquence. These are called the advantageous qualities, and these again the disadvantageous ones, viz., irascibility, lack of clarity, pusillanimity, lack of retention and.carelessness.
18.These qualities of himself aud of the opponent must he weigh and find out who out-weighs the other.
19. In this again, there are three kinds of disputants—the superior, the inferior and the equal, in view of the aforesaid qualities of debate alone, and not with reference to all other qualities.
20-(1). Assemblies are of two kinds the assembly of the wise and the assembly of the ignorant. Though of two kinds they again by reason of circumstance may be classified as of three kinds: (1) the assembly of favourably disposed persons, (2) the assembly of impartial persons, and (3) the assembly of unfavourably disposed persons.
20-(2). Before the assembly of unfavourably disposed persons, one should not engage in debate under any circumstances and with any one, whether such assembly be composed of men of learning, experience and dialectical skill of statement and rejoinder, or of ignorant persons
20-(3). If the assembly happens to be one of the ignorant but well-disposed, or of the ignorant but impartial, a person should engage in debate, though not fully possessed of learning, experience and dialectical skill, with another who is not of widespread reputation and is despised by the public.
20-(4). Discussing with such a person, he must speak in obscure, long winded and complicated sentences With great satisfaction of countenance, he must often indulge in ridicule of the opponent and observing the reactions of the assembly, should give the opponent no scope for speech.
20-(5). Using difficult expressions, he should declare that the opponent has failed to reply, or the opponent should be told that his. proposition has been defeated
20-(6). Again, being invited to debate, he must say “Go and study for a whole year. Indeed, you have not properly attended to the instruction of your preceptor,” or he must say to the opponent, ‘This much is enough for thee’. When once an opponent has been shouted down as vanquished he is vanquished for ever; one should not at all engage any more in debate with him.
20. Some are of opinion that even with one superior in debate, a person should dispute like this in a hostile debate. But the wise never applaud a person engaging in hostile discussion with a superior
21-(1). But a person may enter into a hostile debate either with an inferior or an equal, before an assembly of favourably disposed persons. But before an impartial assembly composed of men endowed with attentiveness, learning, wisdom, experience, memory and dialectical skill, a person should engage in debate and observe carefully the strength of the merits and demerits of the opponent; and he should not engage in debate with him on a subject in which the opponent is found to be superior. He should glide over to another subject, being careful not to let it be discovered.
21-(2). But in whatever point the opponent is found to be inferior, he must be quickly overpowered in that. The following are methods which help in quickly overpowering a a inferior disputant.
21. They are: the man not versed in the scriptures must be confronted with the texts of the aphorisms. The man lacking in comprehensive knowledge must he confronted with sentences containing difficult words. The man of little retentive power should be confronted with obscure and long-winded sentences; the person with no originality and resourcefulness must be confronted with repetition in different forms of the same meaning. The person of imperfect power of speech must be condemned and objected to for speaking indistinctly; an impudent man must be put to shame and disgraced; the irascible man must be wearied out by words; the pussilanimous [pusillanimous?] man should be intimidated; the inattentive man must be confronted with syllogistic or methodical exposition and vanquished. By these means may one fully overcome an inferior quickly.
Here are two verses again—
22. In a hostile debate, one should speak skilfully and never object to statements backed by authority. The hostile debate which is serious, enrages some people.
23. And there is nothing that an enraged man may not do or say; and the wise never commend a quarrel before an assembly of good men.
24. One should do thus in the course of a debate.
25-(1). In the begining itself a person should try to do thus. He should get chosen by the assembly a text with which he is fully familiar or a passage which is difficult for the opponent, or, at any rate, should see that his opponent’s position is opposed to the general disposition of the assembly.
25. Or, he must say, “We are unable to choose the subject. May the assembly determine the subject of debate and the rules of debate as it pleases, as it suits it and as it desires to do,” and hold his peace.
26. These are the rules of debating—such is to be spoken and such not to be spoken. Violating this rule one gets defeated.
The Terms employed in Discussion,
27-(1). The following are indeed words that indicate the sense of the course of disputation between physicians [i.e., bhishaj].
27. They are:—(Vāda) Debate, (Dravya) Substance, (Guṇa) Attribute, (Karma) Action, (Sāmānya) Generality, (Viśeṣa) Particularity, (Samavāya) Coexistence, (Pratijñā) Proposition, (Sthāpanā) proof, (Pratiṣṭhāpanā) Counter proof, (Hetu) Cause, (Dṛṣṭānta) Example, (Upanaya) Application, (Nigamana) Deduction, (Uttara) Rejoinder, (Siddhānta) Conclusion, (Śabda) Verbal testimony, (Pratyakṣa) Direct perception, (Anumāna) Inference, (Aitihya) Tradition, (Aupamya) Analogy, (Saṃśaya) Doubt, (Prayojana) Purpose, (Savyabhicāra) Exceptionable statement, (Jijñāsā) Inquiry, (Vyavasāya) Determination, (Arthaprāpti) Implied meaning, (Saṃbhava) Source, (Anuyojya) Imperfect statement, (Ananuyojya) Perfect statement, (Anuyoga) Question, (Pratyanuyoga) Further question, (Vākyadoṣa) Flaw of speech, (Vākyapraśaṃsā) Excellence of speech, (Chala) Quibbling, (Ahetu) Fallacy, (Atītakāla) Inopportune or too late time, (Upālambha) Censure, (Parihāra) Amendment or correction, (Pratijñāhāni), Abandonment of proposition, (Abhyanujñā) Acceptance, (Hetvantara) Fallacious reason, (Arthāntara) Confusion, (Nigrahasthāna) Point of discomfiture.
The Nature of Debate
28-(1). That is known as debate which one enters into with another in a hostile spirit of challenge, with the aid of authoritative texts. Such debate is of two kinds, put in a nutshell—Jalpa, the constructive debate, and Vitanda [Vitaṇḍā], the destructive debate Argument establishing one’s own position is Jalpa. The contrary of it (i.e. continual attempt at refuting whatever is another’s position) is the destructive debate.
28. Thus, for instance, when one says there is rebirth and the opponent that there is not, and each adduces reasons for his own position, the debate is ‘Jalpa.’ The contrary of it is ‘Vitanda’—the destructive debate, which is limited only to pointing out the defects in the opponent’s position.
Definition of ‘Substance’ etc.
29. Substance, attribute, action, generality, particularity and coexistence have been already described with their characteristics, in the Section on General Principles.
Definition of Statement and other terms
30. As regards Proposition—the statement that has to be proved is the ‘Proposition,’ as for example. ‘Man is eternal.’
31-(1) As regards Proof—the proving of a proposition by means of reason, example, application and deduction is called ‘Proof’.
31. First a proposition is to be made. Then it has to be proved. Flow can a thing that has not been proposed be proved? For example, there is a proposition, like. ‘Man is eternal.’ Cause:—as he is not made, by any one. Example:—even as space is not made Application:—as space is not made and is eternal, even so is man. Deduction:—hence he is eternal.
32-(1). As regards Counter-proof—counter-proof is that which establishes the contrary of the opponent’s proposition.
32. For instance, there is a proposition that ‘Man is not eternal.’ Cause:—man is a sense-object. Example:—even as a pot is. Application:—the pot being a sense-object is not eternal, and so is. man. Deduction:—Hence he is not eternal.
33-(1). As regards Cause—it is the means of acquiring knowledge. That is of four kinds: sense-perception (direct experience), inference, tradition and analogy.
33.The knowledge that is obtained from these means is ‘Truth’.
34-(1). As regards Example—that is example which describes the similarity of things in a way which is intelligible alike to the enlightened as well as to the ignorant-
34. As for instance, fire is hot. water is fluid, the earth is firm, and the sun illuminates The knowledge of Sankhya (system of philosophy) is as illuminative as the sun.
35.Application and deduction have been described while explaining ‘Proof’ and ‘Counter proof’.
36-(1). As regards Rejoinder—rejoinder is a retort which asserts the disparity between a cause and its effect when their similarity has been adduced, and asserts the similarity of cause and; effect when their disparity has been adduced.
36. For example, when it is said, ‘The disease of cold is similar in nature to its cause such as contact with snow and the cold wind’, the opponent should declare, ‘The diseases are dissimilar in nature to these causes’, for the heat, burning sloughing or suppuration are dissimilar to the touch of dew at d the winter-wind. This is called rejoinder or retort in its positive and negative forms.
37-(1). As regards Conclusion that is conclusion which is the determination established by investigating in various ways and deducing by means of various reasons.
37-(2). That conclusion is of four kinds: Universal conclusion (Sarvatantra Siddhānta), Particular conclusion (Pratitantra Siddhānta), Implied conclusion (Adhikaraṇa Siddhānta) and Hypothetical conclusion (Abhyupagama Siddhānta).
37-(3). Among them the universal conclusion is that which is found in each and every treatise on the subject, such as, there are causes, there are diseases and there are means of remedying the remediable diseases.
37-(4). The particular conclusion is that which is found in a treatise of a particular branch of science.
37-(5). For instance, there are said to be eight tastes elsewhere. But here there are oily six. Here are only five sense organs. Elsewhere they are six. Elsewhere diseases are caused by Vata and ether humors. Here they are known as caused by both Vata and other humors as well as by evil spirits.
37-(6). Implied conclusion is that which is determined by implication in the course of a statement of facts; such as, the liberated souls do not act in a Karma-bound manner as they are indifferent to fruits of action. These having been established, others—like the fruits of action, liberation, the individual and rebirth are concluded by implication.
37. The hypothetical conclusion is that which is taken for granted by physicians at the time of debate though it has not been established nor investigated into, nor taught nor even based on reason; as for instance we shall talk taking substance to be primary, taking attributes to be primary, taking action as primary etc. These are the four kinds of conclusions.
38-(1). As regards the ‘Word’ or verbal testimony, the word is a collection of letters. It is of four kinds—of observable meaning, of unobservable meaning, true, and false.
38-(2). Of them, the word of observable meaning is, for instance, like this. Owing to the three, causes, the body-humors are provoked Through the six modes of treatment they abate. Where the hearing is good, these words are apprehended.
38-(3). The word of unobservable meaning is such as “There is rebirth: there is liberation”.
38-(4). The true word is that which js faithful to reality; such as there are Ayurvedic (medical) instructions; there are the means of cure for curable diseases. Efforts bear fruit.
38. The contrary of the ‘True’ is ‘False.’
39. As regards Direct Perception—direct perception is that which is perceived by the mind and the senses directly. Of them, happiness, sorrow, like and dislike etc., are perceived by the mind. Sound and other objects are perceived by the senses.
40-(1). As regards Inference—that is inference which is a conclusion based on reason.
40. For instance, we infer digestive fire from the power of digestion, strength from the power to exercise, one’s sense of hearing etc., from one’s capacity to perceive sound and other sense-objects
41. As regards Tradition—tradition means the instruction of reliable sages; such as the Vedas etc.
42-(1). As regards Analogy—analogy is that which shows the similarity of one thing to another.
42. As for instance, the disease called (Daṇḍaka) rigidity is explained by the word ‘staff,’ whose quality is wooden rigidity; the disease called (Dhanustambha [Dhanuḥstambha]) tetanus is explained
by the similarity of the body affected by it to (Dhanus) the bow, and the physician is known as (Iṣvāsa) the releaser of the arrow that hits the mark, for, like the bowman, he successfully hits the cause of disease and restores good health.
43-(1). As regards Doubt—doubt is uncertainty of mind regarding things.
43. Some people are seen with the signs of long life and some without them; some receive treatment and some do not receive treatment. The former type die, while the latter live. Having seen both, there arises the doubt—‘Is there premature death or is there not?’
44-(1). As regards Purpose—purpose is that for the attainment of which efforts are made.
44. For instance, a person says, ‘If there is untimely death I shall treat myself thus aiding the factors that lengthen my life and avoiding the causes that make for the shortening of life. How will premature death ovepower me then?’
45. As regards Exceptionable Statement—that is an exceptionable statement which admits deviation from the path, as for instance, in. this dis ease this may act as a remedy or (sometimes it may not).
46. As regards Inquiry—inquiry is investigation, as in the case of investigation of remedies described later on.
47. As regards Determination—determination is ascertainment. As for example, this disease is born of Vata; this certainly is its remedy.
48-(1). Implied meaning is that where, from what is expressed, that which is unexpressed, is inferred.
48. For instance, in a statement “this disease is not amenable to impletion therapy”, implies “this disease is amenable to the depletion therapy”. Again, this man should not eat in the day, implies that he should eat in the night.
49. As regards Source—that is the source from which a thing is born; as for instance, the six proto-elements are the source of impregnation; what is unwholesome is the source of disease, what is wholesome is the source of health.
50-(1). As regards Imperfect Statement—the imperfect statement is that which is beset with the defects of speech. It is also that statement which when generally stated, requires clarification (when questioned further).
50. For instance, “This diseased amenable to purificatory treatment”, engenders questions like, ‘is it amenable to emesis or purgation?’
51. The Perfect Statement is the contrary of the above. As for instance, ‘This disease is incurable.’
52-(1). As regards Question—question is that which an opponent puts when two persons of the same branch of science discuss a general or particular topic in a common treatise or a chapter in the same treatise, in order to test the knowledge, experience and the dialectical skill of the speaker.
52. For instance, when one states ‘Man is eternal’ the other asks ‘what is the cause?’ That is a question.
53. As regards ‘Further Question’—further question is a question about the question; as for instance, when the question is answered, the disputant further questions, “What is the cause of that?”
54-(1). As regards Flaw of Speech—that is a flaw of speech, wherein the sense in words is either insufficient or superfluous or meaningless or delusive or contradictory But for these faults, the meaning is not lost.
54-(2). As regards Insufficiency—that statement is insufficient wherein of proposition, cause, example, application and deduction, any one is found wanting; or where there are many causes for proving a thing and yet one proves it by adducing only one cause; that is insufficiency.
54-(3). As regards Superfluity—it is the opposite of insufficiency; when the discussion is about Ayurveda, to cite the authorities of Brihaspati or Ushanas or other irrelevant texts is.superfluity; or even a relevant passage if repeatedly spoken, makes superfluity owing to the flaw of repetition, Repetition again is of two kinds. Repetition of the sense and repetition of words. Repetition of the sense is where words like (Bheṣaja [Bheṣaja] Aushadha [Auṣadha] and Sadhana) medicine, remedy and curing agent are used, though they all mean the same thing. Repetition of words is where the same word is repeated like Bheshaja, Bheshaja, i. e. medicine, medicine,
54-(4). As regards Unmeaning Speech—unmeaning speech is that which is comoposed only of a group of letters without any sense, like the five groups of consonants.
54-(5). As regards Delusive speech—that is delusive speech wherein words appear to have sense but are mutually unrelated; as for instance, [Cakra, Na(Ta)kra, Vamsha, Vajra, Nishakara] wheel, crocodile, race, thunder, moon, etc.
54-(6). as regards Contradiction—
that is contradiction in speech which conflicts with examples cited, decision and situation. Example and decision have already been explained
54(7). Now as regards Context—context is of three kinds, viz., the medical context, the sacrificial context and the philosophical context.
54. As regards the Medical Context—Medicine is four-propped (Catuṣpāda); the Sacrificial Context—the sacrificial animals are to be killed by the master of the sacrifice; the Philosophical Context—non-violence towards all creatures must be practised. When a person speaks inconsistently with the context, it is contradiction. These are the flaw’s of speech.
55. As regards the Excellence of Speech—excellence of speech is that which is neither insufficient in sense nor superfluous, which is full of meaning and not delusive, nor self-contradictory and which is explicit in sense. Such speech is applauded as Perfect Statement.
56-(1). As regards Quibbling—quibbling is the subject-matter of fraudulent, delusive and unmeaning verbosity. This is of two kinds—deception of words and deception of sense.
66-(2). Of them the Deception of Words is thus—one says to another “This Is a Navatantra physician (Nava-tantra meaning a newly initiated one). Then the physician should answer saying, “I am not a Nava-tantra (Nava-tantra meaning versed in nine branches of science), but I am Ekatantra (Eka-tantra meaning versed in one branch of science)” The man might then say, “I do not mean to say that you are versed in nine branches of science, but only that you have newly learnt your science.” To which the physician should reply, “I have not learnt my science nine times but have practised it innumerable times”. Such is the quibbling in words.
56-(3). The general Quibbling or Deception in sense is thus: If one says, “Medicine is meant for the alleviation of disease”, the other should reply, “Oh, did you say, ‘Sat’ is for the alleviation of ‘Sat’?” Sat means existence. Disease and medicine are existences. One existence helps the alleviation of another; then cough is an existence and so is consumption So cough according to you causes alleviation of consumption. This is the Deception of sense or general Quibbling.
57-(1). As regards Fallacy (Ahetu) there are three kinds of fallacies: (1) Prakaranasama (Prakaraṇasama), the fallacy of common cause;,2; Samshayasama (Saṃśayasama), the fallacy, of doubt; Varnyasama (Varṇyasama), the fallacy of analogy.
57- (2). The Fallacy of Common Cause is when it is said, “The soul being different from the body is eternal”, the opponent should say, “Because the soul is different from the body, so it is eternal. The body is not eternal. But the soul being different from the body, to be adduced as the reason for its eternal nature”, is fallacy. That which is the proposition cannot be adduced as a cause.
57-(3). The Fallacy of Doubt is that where the cause of doubt is used as the dispeller of doubt too. For instance when one says, “This man shows an acquaintance with a portion of the science of life. Is he really a physician?” The other should say, “As this man shows an acquaintance with a portion of the science of life, so he must be a physician.” He does not explain the cause which would dispel the doubt. This is, a Fallacy. The cause of doubt cannot become the dispeller of doubt
57. The Fallacy of Analogy is where the cause adduced is the quality of a thing; as for instance, one says, “The intellect is not eternal as it cannot be touched, even as sound,” Here the quality of sound has to be proved and so too the quality of intellect. Hence, it is the fallacy of analogy as both the factors adduced are similar in requiring to be proved.
58-(1). As regards Improper or too late Time—when that which has to be stated before is stated afterwards, it is called improper or too late time- As it is stated too late, it becomes unacceptable
58. When the opportune moment for an argument has been allowed to pass by one, and the opponent has passed on to a different topic, if then, one reverts to the old topic, in order to disc unfit the opponent, one’s statement will not be considered valid on account of its being belated.
59. As regards Censure—censure is the loop-holing of another’s reasons as in the instance shown above, with regard to fallacies and invalid reasonings
60. As regards Amendment—amendment is the correction of a. faulty statement; as for instance, the signs of life are always found in the body in which the soul resides. When it departs the signs disappear. Hence the soul is different from the body and is eternal.
61-(1). As regards Abandonment of Proposition—that is abandonment of proposition when a man, being refuted, gives up his original position.
61. For instance, he makes first a proposition that man is eternal and being refuted, admits that man is not eternal
62. As regards Acceptance—acceptance is agreeing, by a person, to a proposition that is not to his liking but to the liking of the opponent.
63. As regards Fallacy of Reason—that is fallacy of reason where one adduces not the proper but the improper reason for a thing.
64. As regards Confusion—that is confusion or irrelevancy where a man says something when he ought to say something else, as when he ought to speak of the characteristics of fever, he speaks about the characteristics of urinary anomalies.
65-(1). As regards Point of Dis comfiture—discomfiture is defeat at the hands of the opponent. It consists in the incapacity to understand a statement made thrice before a wise assembly, or it is the questioning of a perfect statement, or letting an imperfect statement go unquestioned.
65.It is also abandonment of the original proposition or acceptance of the opponent’s position or inopportune or belated or fallacious argument, inadequate or superfluous or futile or unmeaning argument, repetition, self-contradiction, fallacy of reason or confusion. Any one of these is regarded, as the Point of Discomfiture.
66. Thus have been explained—all the terms of debate, as proposed.
67.In a debate between physicians, they should discuss Ayurveda and no other subject. For, in this, the conclusions are fully evolved out of statements and rejoinders on every subject. One should speak reflecting well on all statements and should say nothing that is irrelevant, unauthoritative, uninvestigated, unhelpful, confused or is too particular. Everything spoken must.be supported by reason. Such statements with their support in reason and clear in their nature, are of use in the science of treatment, for they help to clarify the intellect. The unimpeded intellect achieves the fulfilment of all its efforts.
Some Subjects to be learnt by physicians
68 (1). These are the subjects-that we instruct for the enlightenment of the physicians. For the wise, indeed, applaud the beginning of actions only after a thorough knowledge of their nature beforehand.
68. If a man accomplishes an action having known fully the cause, the means, the source of action, action, the subsequence of action, place, time, administration and the means of administration he accomplishes the desired action and obtains the desired result without much difficulty.
69. The Cause is that which causes. It is the reason of a thing. It is the doer.
70. The ‘Means’ are the things which the doer prescribes when he under lakes performance of an action.
71. That is the source of action which by metamorphosis attains the state of action.
72.‘Action’ is that for the fulfilment of which the doer endeavors.
73. ‘The fruit of action’ is the purpose for whose accomplishment an action is undertaken.
74.‘Subsequence’ is that state which relates the doer with the subsequent result of the action, be it of a happy or unhappy nature.
75.‘Place’ is the region of action.
76. ‘Time’ is also change.
77.‘Endeavor’ is action directed towards an end. it is the action, the performance, the effort and the beginning of a work.
78-(1). The means of action is the integration and the proper adjustment of the doer etc., excepting the ac ion, fruit of action and subsequence of action As it accomplishes the action, it is called the means.
78. It is of no avail in the action that is already over, nor in the action that is current. After the accomplishment of action, there follows the fruit of action aid from it there flows the subsequence of action,
79-(1). All these ten characteristics of action should be investigated and only afterwards is the undertaking of action desirable.
79. Hence, the physician [i.e., bhishaj] who is desirous of action must commence his work after thoroughly investigating all those factors that deserve to be investigated.
Questions for Testing the Physicians
80. A man, be he himself a physician or not, should interrogate a physicion thus. By how many methods of examination should a physician examine who is desirous of administering emetics, purgatives, enemata—corrective or unctuous, and errhines? What is the special subject of examination? Of what use is the examination? When are emetics etc., to be administered? When are they to be avoided and what should be done when there are combined indications of both, and what are the drugs that go into use in these preparations?
Answers for the same
81-(1). If having been asked thus, one desires to confound the questioner, one must say, “Examination is of many kinds, and there are many different things to fee examined. Do you ask me about many methods of examination or of the differences in the things to be examined?
81. If you ask the difference between a thing that is different by virtue of its differential quality, by a mode of examination which is differentiated by its different characteristics, I may describe one or the other variety of the thing which is different by virtue of its different characteristic, by a method of examination which is different by virtue of its differential characteristic, and it may not please you. So tell me what you definitely desire.”
82.Then, examining well what reply he gives, the answer should be made in a befitting manner If the spirit be good and earnest, he must not be confounded. But, when the light situation has arisen, sincere and full answer must be given for his enlightenment
The Two kinds of Examination
83. For learned men, there are only two methods of examination—direct observation and inference. These two and the authoritative texts constitute the methods of examination. Thus, there are two methods of examination, or three, including authoritative texts.
The Ten subjects for Examination
84-(1). How the ten subjects for investigation such as cause etc., which have been already described, should be applied to physicians and other things, we shall now indicate
84-(2). In any given therapeutic action, the cause or doer is the physician, the means are the medicaments, the source of action is the pathological condition of the body-elements, the purpose is the attainment of equilibrium of body-elements, the fruit of action is the attainment of happiness by the patient, the subsequence is indeed life, the place is the country or the patient, and time is the season of the year or the stage of the disease, endeavour is the beginning of treatment, and the method is the excellence of the proper adjustment of the physician etc.
84. ‘Method’ has already been explained as one of the means. Thus, the ten subjects, cause etc, have been explained in their application to the ten things viz., physician etc. These ten in succession constitute the tenfold subject of examination.
85. As to how each one of these subjects is to be tested, will now be duly explained.
86-(1). As the ‘cause’ is said to be the physician in the beginning, its test is thus: the physician is he who ‘physics’, who is skilled in the application of textual wisdom and who knows all aspects of life correctly. Desiring the establishment of the equilibrium of body-elements, he must examine himself first with a view to find out whether he is possessed or not, of the qualities necessary to discharge the work in hand.
86.He who is possessed of the following qualities of a physician [i.e., bhishaj] will be capable of establishing the equilibrium of body-elements, viz., full knowledge of the texts of the science, experience of practical work, skill, purity, deftness of hand, full possession of all the senses, possession of full equipment, knowledge of humin constitution, and promptness of application.
87-(1). ‘Means’ again is medication. Medication is that thing which is prepared by the physician for restoring the equilibrium of body-elements. Any other thing, besides the source of action, endeavor, place and time which subserves the same purpose, is also medication.
87-(2). That is of two kinds, depending upon the difference in refuge or resort, namely—the resort to gods or divine medication, or resort to correlated experience or scientific medicine. Of them, the divine medication consists in incantation, herbal amulets, magical stones, auspicious sacrifice, offerings, oblations, vows, purificatory ritual, fasting, propitiatory invocation, salutations, pilgrimage and such other things. The resort to scientific medicine consists of purification, sedation and other methods whose results have already been tested and observed.
87-(3). This kind of medicine may be subdivided into two kinds—that which is material and that which is immaterial.
87-(4). That which is immaterial is included in the ‘means It consists of the procedures of frightening, causing surprise, obliterating memory, administering shock and inducing elation of spirits, threatening, thrashing, binding, inducing-sleep and the use of massage and similar other acts which are immaterial; and even those that are aids like attendant etc., fall under the category of this means of treatment.
87. The means which is material is used in emesis etc., and of that this is the test:—that it is of such and such nature, of such quality, of such efficacy, is born of such a country or region, of such a season, gathered in such a manner, preserved in such a way, medicated thus, and in such dosage, administered in such and such a disease, to such and such a person, either eliminates or allays such and such a humor. And if there be any other administered medication, in similar manner it should also be examined.
88. The ‘Source of action’ is the discordance of body-elements, Its indication is the advent of disease Its examination consists in diagnosing the signs of decrease or increase of the morbid humors, the constitution and the symptoms of curability or incurability and the mild or the acute stage of disease
89-(1) The ‘purpose of action’ is the restoring of the equilibrium of body-elements. Its indication is the alleviation of the morbid condition.
89.indications are—alleviation of pain, accession of voice and complexion, plumpness of the body, increase of strength, desire for food, relish in eating, timely and proper digestion of the food ingested approach of sleep at the proper time, not seeing frightful dreams (that forbode disease), happy awakening, the proper elimination of flatus, urine, feces and semen, and freedom from impairment of any kind of the mind, the intellect and the sense-organs.
90. The ‘fruit of action’ is the attainment of happiness. Its characteristics are satisfaction of the mind, intellect, senses and the body.
91 The ‘subsequence’ is indeed life. Its indication is its combination with the vital breath.
92. The ‘place’ is the country or habitat of the drug as well as of the patient himself.
93-(1). The examination of the place may be for the knowledge of either the patient or the drug. Here are the details regarding. the knowledge of the patient.
93. They are—in such and such a country was he born or grown up or was attacked by disease; in such and such a country, such and such are the articles of diet used by the people; and modes of exercise and customs, such their strength, such their psychic condition and such their homologation,such their habitus, such are their proclivities, such their peculiar diseases, and such things are wholesome and such unwholesome in general. These are the things to be ascertained. The examination of the soil necessary for the knowledge of drugs is expounded in the Section on Pharmaceutics
The Examination of constitutional traits
94-(1). The ‘place’ of action is verily the patient himself. His examination is for the sake of the knowledge of his life span or that of the measure of his strength and of the intensity of his morbidity. The knowledge of the measure of his strength and intensity of morbidity are essential for the preparation of the medicine which should be in proportion to the degree of morbidity and also to the strength of the patient.
94-(2). (For) A rash administration of a very strong medication without examination, on a weak patient, will upset him. Weak people cannot stand strong remedies predominant in the quality of fire and air, or the treatment by thermal, caustic or operative measures. As such remedies are unendurable, very severe and powerful, they act as immediate destroyers of life.
94-(3). It is for this reason that in emergency, a weak patient should be first treated with non-distressing, mild and generally delicate remedies and later on, gradually, by heavy remedies which do not upset him or give rise to complications. This should be specially done in the case of women. They are by nature unsteady, tender, wavering, easily disturbed and generally delicate, weak and dependant on others.
94-4). But in strong persons affected with a strong disease weak medicine admin;stered without examination, becomes useless.
94. Therefore, the patient must be examined from the point of view of habitus, pathological condition, tone of the system, compactness, proportions, homologation, psychic condition, capacity for food and exercise, and age, specially with a view ascertain the degree of his strength.
95-(1). We shall now explain the characteristics of habitus etc, It is thus. The fetal body develops its habitus from the nature of the germoplasm, the length of the period of fetal life, the nature of the mother’s diet and behaviour, and the nature of the proto-elemental, combinations.
95-(2). Among these factors which ever element or elements are predominant will be observed to influence the nature of the fetus; therefore are men spoken of as of such and such habitus and humoral susceptibility, beginning from their fetal life,
95. Hence, some are of Kapha habitus, some are of Pitta habitus and some of Vata habitus. Some are of the combined types of habitus. Some are possessed of humoral equipoise. The characteristics of these, we shall describe here.
96-(l). The Kapha humor is unctuous, smooth, soft, sweet, firm, dense slow, stable, heavy, cold, viscid and clear.
96-(2). Kapha being unctuous, those of Kapha habitus have glossy limbs; on account of its smoothness they have smooth limbs; owing to its softness they have pleasant, delicate and clear bodies; owing to its sweetness they have a profusion of semen, desire for the sex-act and children. On account of its firmness, they have firm, well-knit and stable bodies; owing to the denseness of Kapha, they are plump and rounded in all their limbs Owing to its slowness, they are slow in their actions and speech; due to its stability, they are slow in their undertakings and in the change of moods and pathological condition; owing to its heaviness, they are of firm, large and stable gait; owing to its coldness, their hunger, thirst, heat and perspiration are meagre; owing to its viscidity, they are firm and well-knit in their, joints Similarly owing to its clearness they are of clear looks, of clear and m?llow [mellow?] complexion and voice.
96. Owing to the combination of such qualities, those of Kapha habitus are possessed of strength, wealth, knowledge, vitality, gentleness and long life.
97-(1) Pitta is hot, acute, fluid, raw meatish in smell, acid and pungent.
97-(2). Owing to its heat, those of Pitta habitus are intolerant of heat, very hot in the mouth, of delicate and clear bodies, aud. have profuse moles freckles, spots and pimples on the body, are subject to excessive hunger and thirst to early wrinkles, grey hair and baldness, and are possessed generally of scanty, soft and tawny hair on the head, face and body Owing to its acuteness, they are possessed of keen valour and acute digestive fire, are given to taking excessive quantity of food and drink, are subject to incapacity to bear suffering, and are constant eaters. Owing to the fluidity of Pitta, they have flabby and soft joints and flesh and profuse discharge of sweat, urine aud feces. Owing to its raw meatish smell, they smell very much in their arm-pits, mouth, head and body. Owing to its pungent and acid taste, they have a small quantity of semen, limited sex appetite and scanty offspring.
97. Owing to a combination of such qualities, those of Pitta habitus are of moderate strength and life-span and of moderate knowledge, experience, wealth and means.
98-(1). Vata is dry, light, unsteady, abundant, swift, cold, rough and clear.
98-(2). Owing to its dryness, those of Vata habitus are of dry, wasted and small bodies, of long-drawn, dry, low, broken, hollow and hoarse voice, and are always wakeful. Owing to its lightness, they are light and inconstant of gait, behaviour, diet and speech. Owing to its unsteadiness, they are restless in their joints, eyes, brows, jaws, lips, tongues, heads, shoulders, hands and feet. Due to its abundance, they are given to much talk and have prominent veins and tendons. Owing to its swiftness they are quick in their undertakings and variation of moods and pathological changes. They are quickly affected by fear, likes and dislikes. They are quick in grasping and in forgetting too. Owing to its cold quality, they are intolerant of cold, and are greatly liable to suffer cold, shivering and stiffness. Owing to its roughness, they have rough hair on the head, face and body, rough nails, teeth, mouth, hands and feet. Owing to its clearness, they have cracked limbs and their joints always make noise as they walk.
98. Owing to the combination of such qualities, those of Vata habitus are generally of small strength, short life-span, scanty offspring and means, and of meagre wealth
99. In a combined habitus, the qualities are also combined.
Examination of Pathological Symptoms
100. Those possessed of the equipoise of humors, are endowed with all the good qualities described. Thus should one examine, from the point of view of habitus.
101-(1). As regards the point of view of pathological change, the pathological condition is called “disease”. It has to be examined from the point of view of the particulars of causative factors, morbid humors, susceptible body-elements, habitus, country, time and strength and also of the signs and symptoms, The strength of the disease cannot be found out except by means of the intensity of the causative factors etc.
101. If the morbidity, susceptible body-element, habitus, place, time and strength, are of similar nature aud the causative factors and symptoms too are strong, then the disease will develop into a powerful one. If they are of dissimilar nature, then the disease will be a mild one. If the morbid humor, susceptible bodyelement and other factors are of moderate nature as also the intensity of causative factors and symptoms, then the disease will be of a moderate type.
102. As regards the tone of body-element, here we describe the eight body-elements in view of whose perfectness of tone a special knowledge of the measure of men’s strength is obtained. Those elements are—skin, blood, flesh, fat, bone, marrow, semen and psyche.
103-(1). The skin, in those in whom that element is in perfect tone, is unctuous, smooth, soft, clear, thin, covered with short, deep-rooted and delicate hair and is as if full of lustre.
103. Such element indicates happiness, good fortune, power, pleasures, intelligence, knowledge, health and cheer and long life.
104-(1). In those in whom the element of blood is in perfect tone, the ears, the eyes, the mouth, the tongue, the nose, the lips, hands and soles of the feet, nails, forehead and the genitals are unctuous, reddish, shapely and full of lustre.
104. Such perfectness of tone indicates in them happiness, great intelligence, cheerfulness, delicacy, moderate strength and incapacity to endure troubles and heat.
105-(1). Those in whom the ele meat of flesh is in perfect tone, have their temples, forehead, nape, eyes, cheeks, jaws, neck, shoulders bellies, arm-pits, chests and the joints of the hands and feet, covered with firm, heavy and comely muscle flesh.
105. Such perfectness of tone indicates in them patience, endurance, stability, wealth, knowledge, happiness, frankness, health, strength and long life
106-(1). Those in whom the element of fat is in perfect tone, possess excessive unctuousness in their complexion, voice, eyes, hair (on the head, face and body), nails, teeth, lips, urine and feces.
106.It indicates in them wealth, power, happiness, luxury, charity, frankness and delicate living.
107-(1). Those in whom the element of supporting tissue is in perfect tone, have stout heels ankles, knees fore-arm bones, collar bones, chin, head, joints, bones, nails and teeth
107. They are very enthusiastic and active, and bear difficulties. They have strong and firm bodies and live a long life.
108-(1). Those in whom the marrow is in perfect tone, are soft, strong, unctuous in complexion and voice, and stout, long and rounded in the joints.
108. They are long-lived, strong and possessed of learning, wealth, experience, offspring and honor.
109-(1). Those in whom the element of semen is in perfect tone, are gentle and possess gentle light in their eyes which appear as if full of milk, aud are full of cheerfulness They have unctuous, round, firm, close and even teeth, clear unctuous complexion and voice, and are lustrous and large hipped.
109. They are coveted sources of enjoyment for women, and are strong and possessed of happiness, power, health, wealth, honor and offspring.
110.Those in whom the psychic element is in perfect tone, are possessed of memory, devotion, gratitude, wisdom, purity, great energy, skill, courage, prowess in battle, freedom from sorrow, firmness of tread, deep intelligence and character, and are given to good pursuits. Their very characteristics describe their good qualities.
Examination of the Body-build etc.
111. Those in whom all the elements are in perfect fine are very strong, endued with very happy circumstances, able to bear troubles, self-confident in all enterprises, given to good pursuits, of firm and well-knit bodies, firm in tread, of resonant mellow, deep and big voice, and are possessed of happiness power, wealth, pleasure and honor. They are slow in aging and slow in being attacked by disease and have offspring of similar qualities in great number, and are long lived.
112. The contrary qualities indicate imperfect tone of these elements.
113.If the tone of the elements is of a moderate nature, the qualities too are defined as of a moderate nature in accordance with the nature of the tone.
114. Thus, the perfect tone of the eight elements has been described in order to enable a special knowledge of the measure of a person’s strength or vitality.
115.For, otherwise, the physician [i.e., bhishaj] may be deceived by the appearance of the body merely, and conclude a man to be a strong man because of robustness, a man to be weak because he is emaciated, a man to be exceedingly strong because he has a big body, or that a man, small in body, is possessed of small strength. There are persons who appear small in body and emaciated but are strong. For they are like the ant which carries relatively great loads. Therefore, it has been said that a person be tested from the point of view of the tone of these elements.
116. As regards Compactness—compact, well-knit, well-composed, and well-united are synonymous words, and mean the same thing. That is called the well-knit body wherein the bones are symmetrical and well-distributed, the joints are well-bound, and the flesh and blood well combined. Such well-knit persons are strong and the contrary type weak. Moderately knit people are of moderate strength.
117-(1). As regards the proportions of the body, the height, length and breadth of the various limbs are measured in terms of the person’s ‘finger’, meaning a finger-breadth.
117-(2). The feet are four fingers high, six fingers broad and fourteen fingers long. The calves are eighteen fingers long and sixteen fingers in circumference. The knees are four fingers long and sixteen fingers in circumference. The thighs are thirty fingers in circumference and eighteen fingers long, the testes are six fingers long and eight fingers in circumference. The phallus is six fingers long and five fingers in circumference. The vagina is twelve fingers in circumference. The waist region is sixteen fingers broad, the top of the pelvis is ten fingers, the stomach is ten fingers broad and twelve fingers long, the sides are ten fingers broad and twelve fingers long, the distance between the nipples is twelve fingers and their circumference is two fingers. The chest is twenty-four fingers broad and twelve fingers deep. The cardiac region is two fingers, the shoulders are eight fingers each, the shoulder blades are six fingers each, the rear arms are sixteen fingers each and the fore-arms are fifteen fingers each, the hands are twelve fingers each, the axilla are eight fingers each, the (trika) sacrum is twelve fingers high, the back is eighteen fingers high, the neck is four fingers high and twenty-two fingers in circumference; the face is twelve fingers deep and twenty-four fingers in circumference, the mouth is five fingers broad; the chin, lips, ears, the distance between the eyes, the nose and the forehead are four fingers each the head is sixteen fingers high and thirty-two fingers in circumference. Thus have been described the dimensions of each of the limbs.
117. The full length of the body is eighty-four fingers, and the breadth which is the full length of the outspread of the arms, is of the same length. Such proportion of the body is the proper proportion. Long life, strength, vitality, happiness, power, wealth and other desirable qualities are dependant on the proper proportion of the body. The contrary qualities characterise the body that falls short of or exceeds these proportions.
118-(1) As regards Homologation—that is called homologous which has become agreeable to a person by constant use.
118-(2). Those to whom ghee, milk, oil, meat-juice, and all the six tastes are homologous, are strong, tolerant of difficulties, and long-lived.
118-(3). Those who have homologation to dry things and to only one of the tastes are generally of low vitality, incapable of enduring difficulties, short lived, and require small measure of medication.
118. Those of mixed homologation are of moderate strength by virtue of their homologatory condition.
Examination of the Psychic make-up
119-(1). As regards Psychic Element—the mind is called the psychic element. That is the controller of the body through its connection with the soul. It is of three kinds according to the variation in strength. It is high, moderate and low. Men are of high, moderate or low psychic powers.
119-(2). Of them, those of high psychic quality are of the psychic nature as described in the perfect tone of psychic element. Though possessed of small bodies, and in spite of being affected by severe ailments of either exogenous or endogenous type, they look unaffected, owing to the high tone of their psychic quality.
119-(3). Those of moderate psychic quality seek consolation by comparing themselves with others or get composed when consoled by others
119. But those, of low psychic quality, cannot be composed either by themselves or by others. Though possessed of big bodies, they seem incapable of bearing even small ailments. When confronted with fear, sorrow, temptation, delusion or disgrace, or made to listen to tales of wrath, awfulness, hate, horror, ugliness, or see sights of the flesh aud blood of animals and men, they. suffer depression of spirits or pallor or fainting or insanity or giddiness or falling, or even death.
120. As regards the Capacity for Food—the capacity for food is to be judged from the capacity to ingest and the capacity to digest. Strength and life are dependant on food.
121. As regards the Capacity for Exercise—the capacity for exercise is to be judged by the capacity for work. By the capacity for work are the three degrees of strength to be inferred.
122-(1). As regards Age—that indeed is called age or bodily stage which specially depends on the length of the passage of time. That age is of three kinds, broadly divided—childhood, middle age and old age.
122-(2). Of them child hood is that wherein the body elements are immature and the indications of youth are not manifest, when the person is delicate, intolerant of troubles, incomplete in strength and mostly of Kapha element and until sixteen years of age.
122 (3). Again the person is said to be yet developing his body-elements and is generally of Undetermined psychic disposition (character) till he is of thirty years of age,
122-(4). That is middle age wherein has been attained the balance of strength, energy, manhood, valor, understanding, retention, memory, speech discernment and all the body-elements and wherein a man is of strong and of well-determined psychic disposition (character), of compact body-elements, of predominance of pitta element and which lasts till sixty years of age.
122-(5). That is said to be old age wherein (after sixty the body-elements, sense-organs, strength, energy, manhood, valor, undemanding, retention, memory, speech and discrimination begin to decay, the body elements disintegrate and the Vāta element predominates and there is gradual wearing down of the body till the age of a hundred years.
122-(6). A hundred years indeed is the length of life in this world. But there are men who live even more or less than a hundred years
122. Taking their measure of life, three divisions should be made by ascertaining the strength and special characteristics of their constitution free from pathological conditions.
123. In this way the classification into three divisions of high, medium and low, should be made of the strength and special characteristics of constitutions free from pathological conditions. By means of the threefold nature of the classification of pathological conditions, the strength of morbid humors is to be inferred. Then classifying the medications under the three-fold category, as strong, moderate and mild; the
medication appropriate to the morbidity is to be administered.
Examination of Physiognomic marks
24. The signs of ascertaining the length of life are again described in the Section on “Sensorial Prognosis” and in the chapter entitled “The continuation of one’s lineage”.
Seasonal Division of time
125-(1). Time, again, is considered from the point of view of season and the stage of the disease. The year is divided taking into view the effects of season, into divisions of two, three, six or twelve, and even more.
125. Here (in this treatise) indeed, dividing it into six, the effects are described. Hemanta. Grishma (Grīṣma) and Varsha (Varṣā) are the three seasons having cold, heat and rain as their characteristics. Tn between them again there are three seasons of moderate characteristics called Pravrit (Prāvṛṭ/Prāvṛṣ), Sharad (Śarad) and Vasanta. The first Pravrit is the season for the first rains. For does not the (Varṣā) rainy season come in its wake? Having the purificatory procedure in view, the seasons are divided into six.
Seasonal indications and Contra-indications as regards Emesis etc.
126-(1). of them during the seasons of moderate characteristics, the administration of emesis etc, is laid down, and also the avoidance of the administration in the other seasons
126. The moderate seasons, owing to their mild characteristics of cold, heat and rain are very enjoyable and do not adversely affect either the body or the drugs. But the other seasons, characterised by extreme qualities of cold, heat and rain, are very unpleasant and adversely affect the body and the drugs.
127-(1). In the season called ‘Hemanta’ i. e. winter, the body being afflicted with extreme cold and great sense of discomfort on account of the howling cold winds, the humors get provoked and impeded in their course and the hot quality of the drugs used for purification becomes dulled by the extreme cold of the season Hence it has very little effect on the humors and the body becomes liable to Vata disorders.
127-(2). Similarly, in ‘Grishma’ i.e. summer, the body is affected by the extreme heat and feels a great sense of discomfort on account of the hot winds and the severe sun. The body becomes flabby and the humors are in a deliquescent condition and the hot quality of the drugs required for purification becomes more acute. Hence the administration of these drugs leads to over-action, and the body is also liable to be afflicted with great thirst.
127-(3). In the season called ‘Varsha,’ i.e. rains, the sun, the moon and the stars are hidden and the sky is overcast with rain-clouds, the earth is covered with slush and is full of water and the body-elements are all in a deliquescent condition and the drugs get impaired by contact with water and the wet winds blowing from the clouds. Hence, emesis and other procedures act heavily and the body is liable to take a long time to return to its normal condition.
127-(4). Hence, the avoidance of emesis and other procedures is laid down in winter, summer and the rains, unless it becomes unavoidable.
127. In case of emergency where emesis etc., become inevitable, the physician must create the required seasonal conditions by artificial means. He should by means of combination, preparation and variation in proportion, modify the potency of the drugs to the required standard with reference to seasonal effects, and administer it skilfully and with great care.
128-(1). The indications in the state of the patient as to the proper time or otherwise as regards what medicine should be administered and what not, are thus:—that a particular stage of the disease is not the time for administering a particular drug and that it is the time for a particular other drug; for it must be judged from the stage of the disease. Hence the indication of the proper time or otherwise for administering a drug is dependent on the stage of the disease.
128. Its examination is thus:—repeated investigation of the details of all the stages of a disease in order to determine the mode of administration and the proper drug. For, the use of a drug when the proper time has gone by or when it has not yet come, does not bear fruit It is the opportuneness of time that brings about success of the administration of a drug.
129 Treatment is the beginning of a curative action Its characteristic or sign is the proper and combined action of the physicion, the drug, the patient and the attendant
130. The means again are the excellence of the physician etc., and the proper method of administration. Its signs are—the aforesaid qualities of physician etc., and the administration of medicine viewed from the point of place, time, dosage, homologation and drug action, all of which make for success in treatment, as also the proper mode of preparation.
131. Thus, these ten subjects of examination should be severally examined.
The Purpose of Examination
132. The purpose of such examination is the determination of the line of treatment Treatment means the knowledge of the practical application of the measures by which a disease should be countered.
133. Where emesis etc., should be administered and where they should be avoided will be explained in extenso later on in the Section on “Success in Treatment.”
134-(1). In a condition where the indications for administration and avoidance of administration are both present, the physician [i.e., bhishaj] should weigh the relative strength of both the symptoms and decide in favor of whichever symptoms outweigh the other.
134. Diseases are described in scientific treatises in their general and exceptional natures, for the purpose of treatment. Therefore is it urged, that symptoms should be weighed properly, and in view of their relative strength, the line off treatment determined.
Pharmacological list of Emetic drugs
135-(1). We shall now describe the drugs that go into use in the preparation of the emetic dose etc.
135 They are:—the fruits of emetic nut, bristly luffa, bottle gourd, sponge gourd, kurchi and bitter luffa; leaves and flowers of emetic nut, bristly luffa, bottle gourd, sponge gourd, kurchi and bitter luffa; the decoctions of the roots of purging cassia, kurchi, emetic nut, thorny staff tree, Patha, trumpet flower, jequirity, tri-lobed virgin’s bower, dita-bark tree, Indian beech, neem, wild snake gourd, corella, guduch, white lead wort, catechu tree, climbing asparagus, yellow-berried nightshade and drumstick; or that of liquorice, mahwa, variegated mountain ebony, white mountain ebony, cadamba, hijjal tree, scarlet gourd, flax hemp and mudar, rough chaff tree or of cardamom, fragrant piper, perfumed cherry, big cardamom, coriander, Indian valerian, nardus, fragrant sticky mallow, Himalayan silver fir and cuscus grass; or of sugar cane, white sugar-cane, long leaved barleria, sacrificial grass, elephant grass, negro coffee or of nutmeg, Spanish jasmine, turmeric, Indian berberry, white and red flowered hogweed, large and small wild blackgram or of silk cotton tree, Shalmalika (Śālmalika), white teak; [galangal?], Indian spinach, wild millet, Indian linden, Indian ape-flower, red physic nut, Indian sarsaparilla and Indian water chest nut; or of long pepper, pepper root, piper chaba white flowered leadwort, ginger, rape-seed, or treacle or the water mixed with milk, alkali or salt, should be prepared as desired or of as many drugs as are available, and making them into suppositories, powders, tinctures, unctions, decoctions, meat-juices, gruels, soups Kambalika and milks, sweet meats and various other edibles, they should be administered in proper mode to the patient who is to be given the emetic dose. Thus has been given in brief the description of various preparations to be made out of emetic drugs. In a later part of the book, the pharmaceutics of these drugs will be described in extenso.
Pharmacological list of Purgative drugs
136. The purgative drugs are:—black turpeth, turpeth, purging cassia, lodh, thorny milk hedge plant, soap pod, clenolepis, red physic nut and physic nut; milk of these taken mixed or unmixed with the similar parts of other drugs or with the decoction of wild carrot, winter cherry, Ajashringi (Ajaśṛṅgī), asthma weed, indigo or liquorice, or of Indian beech, prickly brazil wood, lentils, kamala, embelia, colocynth or of tooth-brush tree, buchanan‘s mango, grapes, white teak, sweet fakah, small jujube pomegranate, emblic, chebulic and beleric myrobalans, white and red hog’s weed, ticktrefoil, or with the Sidhu (Sīdhu), Sura (Surā), Sauviraka (Sauvīraka), Tusholaka (Tuṣolaka), Maireya, Medaka, Madira (Madirā), Madhu, Madhulika (Madhūlikā) wines, sour gruel, or small jujube, jujube, date and sour jujube or with curds, whey or diluted butter-milk, and all or as many of these drugs as are available, prepared with the milk and urine of the cow, buffalo, goat and sheep, and made into suppositories, powders, wines, tinctures, unctions, decoctions, meat-juices, soups, Kambalikas (Kāmbalikas), gruels milks and sweetmeats and other edibles, to be given to suit the proper mode of administration of purgation to the patient. Thus has been explained the pharmaceutics, in brief of purgative drugs. The pharmaceutics of these in extenso will be duly explained in a later section.
137-(1). As the drugs that go into the preparations of corrective enema to suit the various conditions of the patients, are innumerable, it would be wearisome to give an elaborate list of their names here. It is necessary to make the narration in the treatise neither too prolix nor too succinct. But a complete knowledge of them is necessary. Therefore we shall classify them here, keeping only their tastes in view.
137-(2). The combinations of these tastes also are innumerable, as the subtle blends of tastes in substances are innumerable.
137. Hence, taking substances by their single predominant taste for the purpose of defining, illustrating and classifying them according to the.six categories of tastes, the drugs used in the corrective enema are divided into six divisions
Drugs for Corrective enema to be selected by their Taste out of the innumerability of drugs
138-(1). Some physicians are of opinion that there are six varieties of drugs used in corrective enema each possessing a single taste. But that is not possible, as each drug is possessed of a combination of tastes.
138 It is therefore, that drugs that are sweet, or are primarily sweet, or that are sweet in postdigestive effect, or sweet in action are described as belonging to the sweet class of drugs. Similar is the case with other classifications of drugs.
139-(1) They are:—Jivaka (Jīvaka), Rishabhaka (Ṛṣabhaka), cork-swallow wort, Vira (Vīrā), featherfoil, Kakoli (Kākolī), Kshirakakoli (Kṣīrakākolī), wild green gram, wild black gram, tick trefoil, painted leaved uraria, mussel shell creeper, guduch, Meda (Medā), Mahameda (Mahāmedā), galls, Indian waterchestnut, guduch, wild dill, wild fennel, Shravani (Śrāvaṇī), east Indian globe thistle, wild cumin, common millet, Shukla (Śuklā), Kshirashukla (Kṣīraśuklā), heart-leaved sida, evening mallow, white yam, milky yam, small wild black gram, large wild black gram, elephant creeper, winter cherry, white and red flowered hog’s weed, Indian nightshade, yellow-berried nightshade, red flowered castor plant, tri-lobed virgin’s bower, small caltrops, epiphytic orchid (vanda), climbing asparagus, dill, mahwa, liquorice, Madhulika (Madhūlikā), grapes, date, sweet [falseh?] cowage seeds of orris root, rashnut, bulrush, Indian ape flower, clearing nut, fruits of white teak, Shitapaki (Śītapāki), crested purple nail-dye, sprouts of palmyra palm and date, sugar cane, long leaved barleria, sacrificial grass, elephant grass, prickly sesbane, penreed grass (roots), asthma weed, wild black gram, teak, devil’s cotton, oblong leaved croton wild asparagus maiden’s hair fern, small stinking swallow wort, white scutch grass or blepharis, [ring?] coronet swallow wort, cardamom, Somavalli, Indian sarsaparilla and guduch.
139. Of these and similar other drugs as are classified as the sweet group of drugs, those that are fit for cutting should be cut into bits and those that are fit to be ground should be ground into a fine powder, and placed, after washing with water, in a clean pot and soaked in equal quantities of milk and water and should be boiled, and the decoction kept stirring with a ladle. When it has been reduced to the required quantity and the essence of the drugs has got into the decoction, and before the milk has been charred, the pot should be taken down from the fire and the decoction strained. When it is genially warm, ghee, oil, fat, marrow, rock-salt and treacle should be mixed with it in due measure and properly administered as enema, by the expert physician in case of Vata-disorders. The cooled decoction, mixed with honey and ghee, should be -properly administered in Pitta disorders Thus has been described the sweet group of drugs
140 (1) Fruits of mango, Indian hog plum, Lakuca, bengal currant, citron, common sorrel, jujube, small jujube, pomegranate, pomello, Gandira (Gaṇḍīra), emblic myrobaian, oval-leaved fig, Shitaka (Śītaka), tamarind, lemon, orange, ceylon oak, Indian linden, leaves of Indian hog plum, heart-leaved fig, yellow wood sorrel, acid of the four kinds of acid plants, both kinds of jujube—green and dried, both kinds of dried sour bulbs—wild kind and the kind growing in villages, the articles used for making medicated wines, the wines called Sura (Surā), Sauvira (Sauvīra), Tushodaka (Tuṣodaka), Maireya Medaka, honey-vinegar, Shidhu (Śīdhu) wine, curds, whey, diluted butter-milk, sour conjee and such other things
140. Of these and such other articles classified as sour group of drugs, those of them that can be cut, should be cut into small bits and those that are fit to be ground, should be ground into fine powder and pouring the liquids on them and cooking them in a pot and straining and duly mixing them with oil, fat, marrow, rock-salt and treacle, the expert physician should properly administer them when genially warm, in cases of Vata-disorders. Thus has been described the sour group of drugs.
141-(1). Rocksalt, Sauchal salt, kalbag rock-salt, Bid salt, prepared salt, marsh or swamp salt, well salt, sand salt, prepared black salt, sea salt, sambar lake salt, efflorescence salt, saline soil salt, poiton[?] salt, earth salt and such other things are classified as the salt group.
141. The expert should properly administer them in genially warm condition as enema, in Vata disorders, mixed with unctuous substances and with either acid articles or with genially warm water. Thus has been described the salt group of articles.

142 Of these and such other articles as are classified as the pungent group of drugs, those that are fit to be cut should be cut into small bits and those that are fit to be ground, should be ground into fine powder and mixed with cow’s urine; then they should be strained and duly mixed with honey, oil and rocksalt. The expert should properly administer this as enema in case of Kapha-disorders. Thus has been described the pungent group of drugs.

143. Of these and such other drugs classified as the bitter group of drugs, those that are fit to be cut should be cut into small bits and those that are fit to be ground should be ground into fine powder and boiled. It must then be strained and duty mixed with honey, oil and rocksalt and should be property administered by the expert in a genially warm condition as enema in Kaphadisorders The cooled decoction mixed with honey and ghee should be properly administered by the expert in Pitta-disorders. Thus has been described the bitter group of drugs.

144. Of these and such other articles which are classified as the astringent group of drugs, those that are fit to be cut should be cut into small bits and those that are fit to be ground, should be ground into fine powder, washed and mixed with water and cooked into a decoction. It should be strained and duly mixed with honey, oil and rock salt and properly administered in genially warm condition, by the expert as enema, in Kapha-disorders. The cooled decoction, mixed with honey and ghee, should be properly administered by the expert in Pitta-disorders. Thus has been described the astringent group of drugs.
Here are verses again—
145. These six groups of drugs, which have been classified according to their difference in taste, are useful in all the preparations meant for corrective enema.
146. The corrective enema, prepared of all these groups of drugs and administered by an expert, cures all the diseases wherein it is indicated.
147. Those drugs which have not been indicated in any particular type of disorders, are to be inferred as being provocative of them.
148. Thus, the six groups of drugs used in corrective enema, classified according to their taste, have been expounded
149-(1). The intelligent physician [i.e., bhishaj] may discard, among these group of drugs, whichever he considers to be unfit for use in a given circumstance and add whatever drug he considers useful, though it may not have been mentioned as such. Being guided by reason, he may mix drugs of one group with those of another or many others.
149-(2). Like the initial handful of grain carried by the mendicant and the seeds in the hands of the sower, these aphorisms, though small in measure, yield to the intelligent physician, abundant result i.e. complete knowledge of the subject. It is thus a guide to the intelligent physician in the use of his powers of imagination and logic. But, for the dullard, it is good to faithfully follow the method laid down.
149. Following the prescribed way, such a physician accomplishes his task; if the illustration he too succinct or too elaborate, he will fail in his task.
150-(1). We shall hereafter describe the drugs that are used in unctuous enemata. Unctuous enema is unctuous substance. Unctuous substance is of two kinds—the vegetable and the animal. The vegetable kind is classified as oil of til and as oil of other than til. We shall refer to them both here as oil, taking oiliness as the primary sense of oil. The animal variety is fat, marrow and ghee.
150. Of these, oil, fat, marrow and ghee, each substance is superior in quality to its succeeding one for use in unctuous enema in disorders of Vata and Kapha. In the case of Pitta disorders each substance is superior to its preceding one. But by virtue of preparation, all of them ate fit to go into use in all disorders
Drugs used in Unctuous Enemata
151-(1). The articles that go into the preparations of errhines are—(1) The fruits of rough chaff tree, long pepper, black pepper, embelia, drum-stick, siris, Indian toothache tree cumin, celery, brinjal, big cardamom, fragrant piper; (2) The leaves of deodar, holy basil, shrubby basil, Gandira (Gaṇḍīra), Kalamalaka (Kālamālaka), Parnasa (Parṇāsa), sneezewort, sweet marjoram, turmeric, gingery, radish, garlic, wind killer and rape; (3) The roots of mudar, white mudar, costus, oblong leaved croton, sweet flag, rough chaff tree. Shveta (Śvetā), staff plant, colocynth, Gandira (Gaṇḍīra)—Pushpi (Puṣpī), Indian borage, climbing nettle, mercury, Brahmi (Brāhmī) and Indian atees; (4) The bulbs of turmeric, ginger, radish and garlic; (5) The flowers of lodh, emetic nut, dita bark tree, neem and mudar; (6) The exudation of deodar, eagle wood, long-leaved pine, Indian olibanum, Indian ash tree, spinous kino tree, and asafoetida; (7, The barks of Indian tooth-ache tree, cinnamon, zachum oil plant, drumstick, Indian nightshade and yellow-berried nightshade.
151-(2). Thus, these are the seven varieties of articles used in errhines, classified according to their sources viz., fruits, leaves, roots, bulbs, flowers, exudations and barks of plants
151. Those that are salt, pungent, bitter and astringent in taste and are beneficial to the senses, as well as even other drugs that are not mentioned here but that may be regarded as beneficial in the preparations, are recommended for use as errhines.
Drugs used in Errhination
Here are the recapitulatory verses—
152-154. The test of the treatise, he teacher and the disciple, and its purpose, the method of study and of instruction, and the method of disputation; the forty-four technical terms pertaining to disputation, the ten other terms such as causes etc., the nine queries about examination etc., and the drugs that go into use in emesis and other procedures have all been methodically explained in this chapter on the specific determination of the measure of the science of healing [i.e., roga-bhishaj-jiti-vimana].
155.Various modes of expressions with their varied import, many kinds of definitions of wondrous significance, various modes of speech characterised by exquisite phrasing and syntax, and calculated to annihilate the arguments of the opponents in debate, have all been described here.
156. One who is versed in this science of speech that is supported on varied reasoning and that disproves the opponent’s view, is not afraid of an opponent’s arguments; nor can he be defeated by such an opponent in debate.
157. Thus the specific determination of morbid humors and all other things necessary for their knowledge, have been defined from the point of view of their cause and measure, aud according to their proper classification.
8. Thus in the Section on “Specific Determination of Measure” in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the eighth chapter entitled “The Specific Determination of the Measure of the Science of Healing” is completed.
(Here ends the Section on “Specific Determination of Measure” in the treatise compiled by Agniveśa and revised by Caraka.)
Agnivesa’s Queries
3. (Agniveśa asked the wise sage—)“O, wise one! into how many categories is man [purusha] divided in view of the diversity of the elements that compose him? Wherefore is he said to be the cause? What is his origin?
4. Is he ignorant or endowed with knowledge? Is he proven to be eternal or non eternal? What is Prakrti, the primal matter? What are its modifications? What is, the mark of Purusha, the man [purusha]?
5. The knowers of the self declare the spirit to be non-active, free, endowed with lordship, all-pervading infinite, the knower of the field and the witness likewise
6. O, worshiped one! if the spirit is thus non-active, how, then, is activity predicated of it? And if it is free, how is it that it is born of undesirable wombs?
7. If it is endowed with lordship, wherefore is it drawn perforce into suffering? And if it be all-pervading, why does it not experience the totality of sensations at once?
8. And wherefore does the infinite one not perceive what is hidden behind a hill or a wall? There is also the doubt as to which is prior, the knower of the field or the field itself?
9. On the one hand there can be no knower of the field unless the field as the object of knowledge is already there. On the other hand if the field is the prior of the two, then the knower of the field cannot be said to be eternal.
10. And of whose activity is the spirit the witness, since there is no agent other than itself? And how can there be in the immutable Spirit the changes wrought by sensations?
11. And, O, worshipful one! which of the three types of ailments of the patient does the physician treat—the past ailment, the present one or the future one?
12. As for the future ailment, it has not yet arrived; the past, too, having gone does not return; and even of what is said to be the present one, there is no abiding place since the present is never the same from one moment to another. Hence arises the, doubt.
13. What is the cause of sensations? What is their resort? Where do all sensations cease completely?
14. And by what marks is that Universal Spirit known, which is omniscient; which transcends everything, which is freed from all attachments, which is the One and which is tranquil?”
15. Having heard these words of Agnivesha, Punarvasu, the foremost of the wise, and the self-composed, explained everything in its true light.
The different classifications of Man
16. Man [purusha] is said to be the sum of the six elements namely, ether and the four other proto-elements, the sixth being the element of consciousness. By some The conscious element alone is said to constitute Man [purusha].
Man composed of twenty-four elements
17. Again, in consequence of the elemental modifications, man is said to be composed of twenty-four elements, viz., the mind, the ten organs (five cognitive and the five conative), the five sense-objects, and the eightfold Prakrti or evolutes of nature.
The existence of the mind
18-19. The presence of cognition as well as the absence of cognition constitute an indication of mind. Thus if the spirit, the senses and sense-objects are apposite but the mind is. elsewhere there is no cognition, but with the mind present there is cognition. The mind is said to have two properties—atomic dimension and indivisible, unity.
Its objects
20. Whatever admits of being thought about, considered, speculated about, meditated upon, imagined—in fact whatever can be known by the mind—all that goes by the name of the ‘Object’.
Its Action
21. The functions of the mind are—direction of the senses, control of itself, reasoning and deliberations. Beyond this is the field of the intellect.
The intellect
22-23 The sense-object is cognised by the sense which is in conact [contact?] with the mind. Thereafter, it sense object) is interpreted or understood by the mind with reference to its merits and demerits. Guided by whatever conclusive judgment thus formed regarding the matter in hand, one endeavors to speak or act fully aware of the nature of one’s action.
The ten organs
24. The five cognitive senses, each succeeding one of which has one more of the elements beginning with ether, are to be inferred from their respective functions from which proceeds understanding.
25-26. The conative organs are five—the two hands, the two feet, the anus, the genitals, and the organ of speech. The feet are employed in locomotion, the anus and genitals in excretion, the hands in seizing and holding, the organ of speech—the tongue, in speaking. Now speech which is true is illuminating and speech which is false is obscuring.
The Qualities of the five elements
27. The five proto-elements are the ether, air, fire, water and earth. Sound, touch, color, taste and smell respectively are the characteristics of the five proto-elements.
28. Of these elements, the first has only one quality; while in each succeeding one there is a corresponding increase of qualities. Thus in each succeeding element, there are found the preceding elements and their qualities too
Their Special characteristics
29. Hardness, fluidity, motion and heat are respectively the attributes of the earth, water, air and fire. The characteristic of ether is non-resistance.
30. All these characteristics are perceived by the tactile sense; for the tangible, together with its opposite, is apprehended by the sense of touch.
31. The existence of properties in the body is regarded as the indication of the existence of substances possessing those properties. The senseobjects such as sound etc., are to be known as perceptions, sense-data and properties.
32. A person's perception is qualified by the name of that particular sense-organ through whose agency that perception is born. And a perception born of the mind is styled a mental conception.
33. The perceptions are said to be many in consequence of the diversity of the results, senses and the senseobjects.
34.Each perception arises from the fusion of the spirit, sense, mind and sense-object with each other; just as sound is born of friction, as for instance, when a finger and the base of the thumb are snapped together, or the strings of a lute?are struck with the nails, in the same manner perception is born of conjunction.
The Conglomerate individual of the twenty-four categories
35. That is to be known as transcendental element which upholds this union of the understanding, senses, mind and the sense-objects. This conglomeration of the twenty-four primary elements is known by the sign of Purusha i.e. the embodied one.
36 This conglomeration goes on occurring endlessly in the case of one who is linked to passion and delusion; when, however, these two have been subjugated by the increase of the Sattva quality of mind, the conglomeration ceases
37-38. In Purusha is established action and the fruit of action; in him likewise are delusion, pleasure, pain, life, death and self-love established. He who understands him thus truly, indeed knows dissolution and creation, continuity of the life-process and its cure and whatever else there is to be known.
The Causative Nature of the individual
39. If there were no Purusha, there would be neither light nor darkness, neither truth nor falsehood, no vedas, neither good nor evil action, neither a doer nor a knower.
40-41. If there were no Purusha, there would be no embodiment, no pleasure and pain, no coming and going, no speech, no sciences, no scripture, no birth and death, no bondage and no liberation. Therefore, the knowers of causation have declared the Purusha to be the cause.
42 For, if the Spirit is not the cause, then light etc, would become causeless; nor can any knowledge of these things arise nor will they serve any purpose.
43-44. ‘The pitcher is fashioned by means of clay, turning rod and wheel, even in the absence of the potter. The wigwam is built by clay, straw and wood without even a housebuilder.’ Let one who is prepared to make such a statement declare equally foolishly, bereft of both reason and revelation, that the embodiment is brought about by the concourse of the elements, without the intervention of an agent.
45. However, Purusha, the self, is seen to be the cause according to all forms of testimony, including scripture, whereby the knowable is tested and recognised.
46-47. Phenomena are never the same but are continually in a state of flux; whenever they are of a similar nature they are said to be the same, although, in fact, they are produced anew. The soul-less conglomeration of phenomena is, by some, said to constitute the organism. They do not believe in a Self who is the doer and the enjoyer.
48. Those who do not accept the existence of the seif, preach in effect, that the effects of the actions of one are enjoyed by a new another who is similar.
49 The instruments of the doer are many and varied but the agent is always the same. The agent with his instruments is the cause of all activity.
50-51. Phenomena are destroyed in a shorter tims than the winking of the eye Those that are destroyed can never recur and the action of one cannot cling to another; This is the opinion of the knowers of truth; what is known as the eternal self is the cause both of action and its enjoyment in all creatures.
52. The ego or the sense of selfhood, fruit of action, action, reincarnation and memory exist in the absence of the physical body, because of the existence of the self in creatures.
The origin of individual
53. The transcendental self, being beginningless, has no birth; while.the embodied being is, the product of the fruit of actions performed through delusion, desire and aversion.
54.The self is the knower. Its knowledge proceeds from its contact with the instruments of knowledge, viz., the senses, mind and understanding. But in the absence of the contact of organs, or in case they are defective, there is no cognition.
55 Just as one cannot catch a clear reflection in a mirror or water, if either is clouded, so is the case if the mind is obscured.
53. The instruments are the mind, the understanding, the five cognitive and the five conative organs. When these associate with the doer or the self, then action, sensation and understanding result.
57. By itself the self can neither act nor enjoy the fruits of action. Everything proceeds from the union of the several factors; in its absence there is nothing whatever.
58. Nothing can exist singly or unrelated to a cause. Being transient by nature, it cannot escape destruction,
59. That self which has no beginning in time is eternal; the contrary is the case with the self who is caused. An entity that has no beginning is regarded as eternal while a thing that has a beginning is regarded otherwise.
60. That higher self does not come under the category of anything; being eternal it cannot be grasped. It is unmanifest and unthinkable. The manifest is otherwise.
61. The unmanifest is the self, the knower of the field, ever-lasting, all-pervading and unchanging. Other than such is the manifest, Now this duality will be explained in another way.
62. Whatever is perceptible, being apprehendable by the senses, is the manifest; but what is imperceptible and is beyond the senses and can be known only by inference is the unmanifest.
The Eight principles of Nature and the Sixteen evolutes of Nature
63-64. The five elements beginning with ether, as also the understanding, the unmanifest self, and ego the eighth, constitute the eightfold nature of all beings. The modifications are sixteen. The five cognitive organs, the five conative organs and the five sense-objects, together with the mind, are styled the modifications.
The knower of the field
65. All this, with the. exception of the unmanifest, is spoken of as the field; while the unmanifest is regarded by the seers as the knower of the field.
66-67. From The unmanifest is born the intellect, from the intellect arises the ego Thereafter from the ego are evolved ether etc., in orderly succession. Then the whole man possessed of all the faculties springs into view and is said to be born. Then, again, in the final dissolution, he gets disjoined from these desired associations
68. Out of the unmanifest, man rises to the manifest stage and again sinks into the unmanifest. Passion and delusion having taken possession of him, man revolves from birth to death like a wheel.
69. Those who are attached to the pairs of opposites and to egoism, are subject to creation and dissolution; but not those who are not so attached.
The attributes of the spirit
70-73- The signs of the self are:—respiration, winking etc., animation, mental activity, inter-communication of sense-perceptions, impelling, upholding, travelling to far countries in dreams, likewise experience of death in dreams, recognition by the left eye of what is seen by the right eye, desire, hate, pleasure, pain, effort, awareness, resolution, understanding, recollection and the sense of ego. Since these signs are observed in the living organism alone and not in the dead, therefore the great sages have declared them to be indicative of the Self.
74. The Self having left the lifeless body, like an untenanted house, man is said to be reduced to a pentad, because of the five residual elements.
75. The mind is unconscious but active. The impeller, however, is the self, of which when yoked to the mind, all activity is predicated.
76. Because the self is the conscious element, therefore is it called the agent or doer; while the mind, though actually performing, is not called the doer, because it is devoid of consciousness.
77. In as much as all living beings cause themselves to be linked to all kinds of bodies by their own free will, there is no question of another and external administrator.
78. Being its own master, the self performs those actions, whereof it subsequently enjoys the fruits; of its own accord, too, the self composes the mind; of its own accord also, it withdraws from everything.
Why the Spirit, though all-pervasive is Limited to local awareness
79. The self, although omnipresent, is localized in its organs of sense. When embodied, and so cannot apprehend all sensations occurring in all bodies.
80. The self is infinite for the very reason that it is omnipresent and supreme. By concentrating the mind, the self is able to perceive even the hidden.
81. Yoked Io the mind which cleaves to it by virtue of the acts performed through the instrumentality of the body, the self, though present in all bodies, is for all practical purposes to be regarded as localized in one particular body,
Which is first, the field or the knower?
82. The self has no beginning, and likewise, the succession of bodies is without a beginning. Both being thus beginningless, neither can be the antecedent of the other.
Spirit only the ‘Witness’
83.It is the knower and not the non-knower that is called the witness. Hence the self is said to be the witness, The vicissitudes of all creatures have the self, for their witness
All experience pertains to the Conglomerate individual
84. The self, when by itself, is not inferrable by any indication; for the imperceptible and pure self has no attribute whatsoever;
85.It is with reference to the embodied self that changes brought about by sensations are predicated; for only that which is affected by sensations is modified
The Treatment of the Disease of the Past, Present or Future
86. Listen now to the argument advanced by those who assert that the physician treats all ailments, whether present, past or future.
87-87½. The headache has returned again, there is a relapse of fever, the violent cough has reappeared, there is recurrence of vomiting: such common remarks show the recurrence of past diseases.
88-89. The time of the relapse of these subjugated diseases has approached. Therefore treatment which is given, keeping in view the period of relapse of a disease, is to be understood as the therapeutics of the past ailment.
90. Just as a dam is raised so that the floods may not destroy the crops as they did during a previous season, so is treatment in the body
91. Having in mind the past symptoms, prophylactic measures taken in view of future symptoms will avert disease
92. The use of whatsoever promotes
well-being, stops the causal chain of suffering and induces happiness.
93. No discord can ensue from harmonious elements, nor any concord from discordant elements; from like causes, like effects are always produced in the body-element.
94. It is for such reasons as set forth above, that the physician is said to remove all disease, whether past, present or future. That is the supreme therapeusis, which is devoid of passions.
95. For, the passions are the cause of suffering and are the producers of pain and its resort, the body. The renunciation of all passions is the means of removing all miseries.
96. Just as the silk worm builds its own tomb viz. the cocoon, similarly the ignorant worldling clings to the thirst for sense-objects and is ever miserable.
97. The wise one, who, viewing sense-objects like fire, withdraws from them, is not touched by pain, by Reason of abstention from action and attachment.
The Causes of Disease
98. the derangement of the,understanding, will and memory, the onset of adverse season and effect of past action, and contact with unwholesome sense-objects—these, should be known as the causes of suffering.
99. That is called derangement of understanding whereby the eternal and the non-eternal, good and evil, are mistaken, one for the other, for, true understanding always perceives rightly.
100. In the event of the derangement of the will, the mind which is always reaching out for its objects, is incapable of being restrained from undesirable objects, for the will is the controller.
101. When, on account of the mind being clouded with passion and delusion, the retention of true knowledge is destroyed, that is called the derangement of memory; for indeed the memorable abides in the memory.
102. Whatever act is done by one who is deranged of understanding, will or memory, is to be regarded as volitional transgression. It is the inducer of all pathological conditions.
103-108. Premature expulsion of excreta or the suppression of natural urges, indulgence in rash acts, overindulgence in women, procrastination of treatment, wrongful undertaking of notions, disregard of modesty and custom, disrespect towards the venerable, indulgence in things which one knows to be harmful or highly intoxicating, moving at improper times and in improper places, friendship with evil-doers, the abandoning of the good habits inculcated in the chapter on the regimentation of the senses, envy, pride, fear, anger, greed, folly, arrogance, delusion, or injurious acts emanating from these, or any act that is harmful to the body, or any similar act arising out of passion and delusion—all these, are said by the sages to be volitional transgressions causative of disease
109. Misconception by the intellect, and misconduct are to be understood as volitional transgressions, because they come under the ken of the mind.
110. In the chapter on the ‘Compendium of Diseases’, we have already laid down the periodicity and incidence of disease and also the accumulation, irritation and subsidence of Pitta and other humors in due order.
111-112. Also the causes of diseases coming under the categories of unusual, extreme and subnormal seasonal variations; the right and wrong time for food to be taken, digested or assimilated; the forenoon, mid-day and afternoon and the three periods of the night; and the diseases which occur at these stated times—all these, are periodical diseases.
113. The fevers that recur on alternate days or the third and fourth days are all periodical, for at stated intervals they become active
114. These and other maladies of various kinds, which are periodic in their occurrence, are to be treated by the physician who is conversant with their intensity and periodicity, before they actually manifest themselves.
115. Those infirmities which come, about in the natural course of time, as the result of senility and completion of the life-span, are to be regarded as natural or terminal conditions and are irremediable.
116. The influence of actions done in the past birth, known as destiny, is also seen in the fulness of time to be a causative factor of disease.
117.There is no action, worth the name, which does not produce a result; the diseases brought on by past actions, counteract the treatment and end only when the force of those actions is spent out.
Unwholesome contact of the senses with the sense-object
118. By the hearing of very loud sounds or by the total avoidance of all sounds, or by straining the ear to catch very low sounds, the sense of audition becomes impaired.
119. To lend the ear to sounds which are harsh, alarming, vile, unpleasing or mournful is said to be the abuse of the auditory sense
120. Absence, excess and insufficiency of contact with those objects that are to be contacted, are, in short, said to be the mis-use of the sense of touch.
121.Contact with evil spirits and poisonous winds or untimely damp, heat and cold, is said to be the abuse of the sense of touch.
122-123. By the excessive gazing at glaring objects, or by looking for very minute objects, or by never seeing them at all the sense of vision is destroyed, The seeing of hateful, terrifying, disgusting, distant or too close or obscure objects is said to be the abuse of the visual organ.
124. Epicurean indulgence, ascetic abstention and indulgence in tastes that are disagreeable to one’s system although they are made homologatory by constant use etc., or very sparing indulgence in taste, are said to be the abuse of the organ of taste.
125-126½. The smelling of odors that are either too pungent or too delicate, or the total avoidance of all smell, is said to be harmful to the organ of smell. The inhaling of smells that are putrid, polluted by evil spirits, poisons, or gases or that are unseasonal; is said to be the abuse of the olfactory sense. Thus, the non-homologous contact of the sense with the sense-object is to be regarded as threefold and as provocative of all morbid conditions
127. That is improper co-ordination, which does not agree with one’s system.
128. Whatever disease of the ear etc, arises as the result of excessive, inadequate or non contact of the sense and its objects, is said to be the disease of the sense-organ.
129. These are described to be the causative factors of painful sensations; the causative factor of pleasurable sensation is proper sense-contact. Such proper contact of the sense aud its object is indeed difficult to achieve.
130. It is neither the senses nor their objects that are the causes of pleasure and pain. The real cause of pleasure and pain is seen to be these four kinds of contact.
131. Granting that there are the senses and the sense-objects, yet if there is no co-ordination there is neither pain nor pleasure; therefore the cause is the fourfold contact alone.
The Causes of pain and pleasure
132. Without the self, the senses, the mind, the.intellect, the object and the action, there can be no pleasure or pain. Each of these is defined in the manner in which it has to be understood.
133. The sense of touch in the skin and also the corresponding faculty in the mind are the dual cause which yields pleasurable and painful sensations.
134. Passion which is of the nature both of desire and hate, proceeds from pleasure and pain; again, passion is said to be the originator of pleasure and pain.
135. Desire it is, that acquires the apparatus of sensation; if there is no apparatus, there is no contact; and if unaffected by contact, one does not experience sensations.
The resort of Experience
136. The apparatus of sensation is the mind and the body together with the sense-organs, with the exclusion of hair of the head and of the body, the tips of the nails, the ingested food, feces, excretory fluids and the sense-objects.
The means of liberation from Life
137. Both in yoga (a state of meditation) and final liberation, there is no existence of sensation; in final liberation there is absolute cessation, while yoga leads to that liberation.
The Nature of Yoga
138-139. From the contact of the self, the senses, the mind and the sense-objects arise pleasure and pain; these two cease to be, as the result of the inaction of the mind which is firmly fixed in the self. Then, while embodied, it acquires the psychic powers, and such a state, the seers who are conversant with yoga, know to be as yoga i.e. beatitude.
The eight attainments in Yoga
140 141. The entering into other bodies, telepathy, the doing of things according to one's own will, clairvoyance, clairaudience, omniscience, effulgence, vanishing from sight at will—these eight are said to be the sovereign powers of the yogis. All this accrues from the concentration of the pure mind.
The Nature of liberation
142. The final liberation, without a return, is said to be the dissolution of all ties resulting from the cessation of passion and delusion, and the wearing away of the influence of powerful past actions.
The way to liberation
143-146. From the accession of the pure understanding all these proceed; the right seeking of the company of the good; the total avoidance of the wicked, continence and abstinence and various austerities, the study of the sacred scriptures, meditation, love of solitude, aversion to sense-pleasures, perseverance in the path of liberation, supreme determination, the non-beginning of actions and the complete annihilation of those already done, the desire to quit the world, humility, dreading attachment, the fixing of the mind and understanding in the self and the investigation of the true nature of things—all this proceeds from the recollection of the true nature of the self.
147. The true recollection comes from the acts beginning with the right seeking of the company of the good and ending with supreme determination. Having recollected in mind the true nature of all things, man gets relieved from suffering
148-148½. The methods of inducing recollection are said to be rightly recalling the circumstances and the appearance by comparison and contrast, by concentration of the mind, by practice, by the acquisition of knowledge and by re-hearing.
149. Recollection is so called because, by dwelling upon what was seen, heard or otherwise experienced, it Collects again the fullness of past experience in the mind,
150-551. This is the only road, consisting of the power, of true recollection which has been indicated for final liberation by those who have attained liberation. Those who set out on this road do not return. This road has been described by the yogis as the path of yoga, and by the liberated seers who have had all the knowledge of philosophy, as the path of liberation.
152-153. All that results from causes, is pain-giving, is other than the self and transitory. Such is not the offspring of the self; yet the self-sense obtains there so long as the true understanding is not born; but the sage, knowing ‘I am not this and this is not mine’, transcends everything.
154. In that final renunciation all sensations together with their root cause, as also cogitation, contemplation and resolution, come to an absolute termination
The signs of the emancipated soul
155. Thereafter the individual self having become one with the universal self is no longer seen as particularised, being rid of all qualities. He has no longer any distinguishing mark The knowers of Brahma alone have knowledge of this; the ignorant cannot understand it.
Summary
Here is the recapitulatory verse—
156. Twenty-three foremost questions concerning the embodied self are dealt with in this chapter on the divisions of man by the knower of Truth,
1. Thus in the Section on Human Embodiment, in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the first chapter entitled “Into how many categories is man [purusha] divided” is completed
The Cause of impregnation
3. What is the thing belonging to man, which brings about conception when deposited in the womb of a woman of an alien clan, during sexual union at the end of her menstrual period, and which is the product of the four proto-elements and the six categories of taste?
4 The wise call that “The sperm” or plasma; which is the product of the four elements of air, fire, earth and water and the six categories of taste and which causes the fertilization of the germ and formation of the embryo.
5. How does the fetus develop into complete form? How is it delivered at the proper moment? How is happy delivery brought about? Why does a woman, though not sterile, conceive after long delay? And why does a fetus die having once been formed?
6. If the quality of the sperm, germ, soul, uterus and the time and the diet of the gravida are wholesome, the fetus will be well developed and healthy and the full grown child will be born at the right time.
Cause for delay in conception
7. Even a fertile woman conceives after long delay owing to the defects of her uterine condition, mental worries, the defect of the sperm or germ or of diet and behaviour, coitus at the wrong time and the decrease in her strength.
Causes for abortion; How, female, male twin or multiple Children are born
8-9. The menstrual blood which is obstructed by the provoked Vata is sometimes mistaken-for conception by some ignorant men. That menstrual blood, which increases in quality, consequent upon its not flowing out, has
all the superficial characteristics of conception. When that obstructed menstrual blood begins to flow out, when she is affected by the heat of fire or the sun, or by exertion, sorrow or disease or by the indulgence in hot eats and drinks and no signs of the fetus are seen along with the blood, some say that evil spirits have stolen away the fetus.
10. If these night-wandering evil spirits given to eating the vital essence do not relish people’s bodies and steal the fetus, why then do they not, having found access into the mother’s womb, eat away her vital essence?
11. Why and how does a woman give birth to a girl, or a boy, or a twin of a girl and a boy, or a boy-twin or a girl-twin or multiple children? Why does a woman give birth after an unduly prolonged gestation and why does, among twins, one child happen to be more developed than the other?
12. If the proportion of germ is greater, a girl child is born and if of the sperm is greater, a boy child. Where sperm-germ is divided in between, a twin will be born. A boy will be formed from the part where the. sperm is predominant, and the girl, from the part where the germ is
13. The boy twins are born where there is preponderance of sperm and when the sperm-germ gets divided into two. The girl twin is born if there is preponderance of germ and it gets divided into two.
14. There will be as many children born at a time as the divisions into which the sperm-germ gets divided, consequent upon severe provocation of Vata and the inevitable result of past actions.
Long gestation
15 When the fetus does not receive sufficient nourishment or there is discharge from the womb, it gets emaciated. A woman will deliver it after prolonged gestation which may take even several years to happen.
Unequal growth in Twins
16.As a result of past actions, the sperm-germ gets unequally, divided. Hence,. among the twins, one happens to be more developed and the other less developed. This is the cause of the unequal growth in the case of twins.
Eunuchoid conditions
17. Why are people born affected with sexual abnormalities such as hermaphroditism or aspermia, anaphrodisia and impotency? Why are they affected with conditions of
hypospadia and mixoscopia and eviration (Eunuch)?
18. Owing to the equal proportions of the sperm and the germ, or the impaired quality of the sperm-germ the hermaphrodite who is of bisexual nature, is born If the provoked Vata enters and lodges in the seat of the sperm during the fetal life of a person, he becomes Liter a victim to aspermia.
19. Where the Vata has obstructed the seminal passage, the person is afflicted with anaphrodisia. Where the sperm and the germ are weak and meagre and the sexual urge either weak or absent, the offspring of such a union is an impotent man or woman.
20. Where during the sexual act the normal position of the father and mother is reversed, owing to the sexual weakness of the father, the offspring is afflicted with hypospadia. Those that acquire the stimulus for sexual urge from the sight of another’s sexual act, are known to be subject to mixoscopia.
21. Those whose testes have been destroyed in the fetal life by the effects of provoked Vata and Pitta, become victims to eviration (eunuchs). Thus, these are the characteristics of the eight kinds of sexual abnormalities which are the results of the actions in the previous lives of the persons concerned,
Signs of recent conception
2 2 What are the indications of conception winch has just taken place and what are the signs that denote whether the fetus in the womb is a girl or a boy or a eunuch? What are the reasons that determine the resemblance of the child to either of the parents?
23. Salivation, heaviness, bodyaches, torpor, indifference (seediness), cardiac distress, sense of satiety and the fertilization of the ovum in the womb are the signs of recent conception
Signs of male, female and neuter conceptions
24. Constant use of the left limbs, desire for man’s society, dreams, and eats and drinks and behaviour befitting women, the fetus being lodged in the left part of the uterus, the uterus not being rounded in shape and the appearance of milk in the left breast first, are the indications in a woman who has conceived a female child
25.A woman, having the contrary indications, has conceived, a male child. A woman showing combined traits has conceived a child with a bisexual nature hermaphrodite. A woman gives birth to a child resembling that [??e??] of whom she thinks at the time of conception.
Resemblance of the child to the Father
28. The fetus is composed of the four proto-elements derived from four sources viz., the father and the mother, the food taken by the mother during the fetal life and one’s own past actions. All these exist in every one’s body.
27. Of these four kinds of proto-elemental combinations born of father, mother and past actions, whichever is most powerful is to be regarded as the determining factor of resemblance while the nature of the past actions alone determines the psychic composition of the child.
28. Why does a woman give birth to a deformed child having limbs and senses either deficient, or in excess or defective? How does the soul migrate from body to body? And by what is it always associated?
29. The malformations of shape, color and the senses are caused by the morbid humors that are provoked by the defects of the spermo-germ, by actions in the previous life, the condition of the uterus and the season as well as the defects of the mother’s diet and behaviour during gestation.
30. As in the rainy season, the pieces of wood and stone that rush down a current of water bend and deform a tree growing in its way, similarly do the provoked humors deform the fetus established in the uterus.
Transmigration of the soul
31. The soul which moves along with the mind, hits from one body to another enveloped by the subtle forms of the four proto elements. As it is of the subtle nature of the tendencies of action, its form cannot be visible except to the mystic vision of the Yogis
32. It is all-pervasive and can take all body-forms. It can do all actions and appear in all shapes. It is the element of consciousness and transcends sense-perceptions It is always in conjunction with the mind, intellect etc, and is associated with the emotions of like and dislike.
33. The proto-elemental combinations born of the tastes of the mother’s diet, of ones own past actions, and of the father and mother, make sixteen altogether. Of them only the four that are the result of the self’s past actions adhere to the self and so does the self reside in them four.
34. The proto-elements derived from the mother and father are known as the germ and the sperm respectively. Those proto-elements with which germ-sperm is nourished are derived from the six tastes of the mother s diet during gestation.
35. Those four proto-elements that are derived from the self’s past actions enter the fetus, being latent in the self. That product of the past action, being latent like a seed in the self, leads the self from incarnation to incarnation to either a lower or a higher order.
36. It is well known that the form is born of the form and the mind is born of the mind, as the result of past actions. Whatever changes may occur in the forms and the minds, are caused by the influence of Rajas and Tamas, i. e. passion and ignorance, and of the past actions of the self,
37. The self is never dissociated from the very subtle and super-sensual elements or from its tendencies of past actions or from the mind and the intellect, or from the principles of the ego and the disorders of passion and ignorance.
38. The mind indeed is bound, by passion and ignorance, and in the absence of knowledge, all disorders are brought about by them. This mind along with its disorders and the force of past actions are the causes of transmigrations of the self from life to life as well as for righteous or unrighteous conduct.
The Cause of alleviation of Diseases
39. How are the diseases born? What are their remedies? What is the cause of joy and what of sorrow? How do psycho-somatic disorders, once quieted, not recur?
40.Volitional transgression, unwholesome sense-contacts and thirdly, seasonal variation are the causes of disease right knowledge, wholesome sense-contacts and normality of season are the remedies.
41. Righteous acts are responsible for joy and similarly unrighteous acts lead to sorrow: by the avoidance of such activity, psycho-somatic diseases do not recur after their subsidence.
Means of preventing the recurrence of Disease
42.This body-mind continuum is said to have no beginning nor has it indeed any. Its cessation can be brought about by meditation, remembering the scriptures and transcendental wisdom.
43. Diseases do not attack the man that always practises prophylactic measures against disorders which have been already described to have two resorts—body and mind, and who has controlled his sense, unless of course, he is temporarily overpowered by the effects of his past actions.
44. What is done in the previous life is called past action and what is being done now is present action. When they are unequal they cause the emergence of disease and when they are equal they cause the alleviation of disease.
45. He who purges away thoroughly the morbid humors accumulated in the body during winter at the beginning of the spring, and of the summer before the rains begin, and of the rainy season at the beginning of the autumn every year, is never afflicted with seasonal disorders
The Path to freedom from Disease
46 He who is given to wholesome food and conduct, who has discernment and detachment from sensepleasures, who is charitable, impartial, truthful and forgiving and who follows the precepts of the seers, lives free from disease.
47. Diseases do not befall a man in whom thought, word and deed are happily blended, the mind is controlled and the understanding is clear and who is possessed of knowledge, austerity and the absorption in Yoga.
Summary
Here is the recapitulatory verse—
48. In the chapter on the exogamous union, the great worshipful sage has cleared all the thirty-six questions so full of import, put by Agnivesha, in order to enhance the wisdom of humanity.
2. Thus, in the Section on the Human Embodiment in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the second chapter entitled “The Exogamous Union” is completed
Atreya states the Manner of Conception
3. Such an embryo grows without disease by being well tended. Then, when the right time has come, it is born with ease, as the result of the sum of all these factors, possessed of all the body-organs, fully developed and endowed with strength, complexion, intelligence aud compactness. Therefore, the infant is said to be born of the mother, born of the father, born of the spirit, born of concordance and boro of nourishment. There is also to be sure, the connecting agent, the mind. So spoke Atreya.
Bharadvaja’s criticism
4-(1). ‘No!’ said Bharadwaja to this. For what reason did he say so? Because neither mother nor father, neither the spirit nor concordance, nor yet the use of drinks or foods that are eaten, masticated or licked up, in fact, bring about the conception. Nor does a mind, coming from another world, enter into the embryo.
4-(2). If the mother and father could, bring about the conception, then seeing that most men and women desire sons, all of them with a view to begetting sons, would, by resorting to cohabitation, procreate sons alone. Or, those desirous of daughters would procreate daughters alone. Neither would there be any childless man or woman, nor would persons, desiring progeny, go about disconsolate.
4-(3). Nor again does the spirit beget itself. If, indeed, the spirit engenders itself, it must do so, being already born, or in the alternative being yet unborn. Both alternatives are untenable. Nothing that is already created can be said to engender itself for the reason that it already exists; nor, again, can an unborn thing be said to engender itself, for the reason that it does not exist. Either way the position is untenable
4-(4). Let us leave it at that. But even if the spirit is capable of engendering itself, why does it not reproduce itself exclusively in desirable wombs possessed of lordship, unrestrained movement, protean power and compounded of splendour, strength, speed, complexion, intelligence and compactness of limbs and exemption from decay, disease and death? For, thus, the spirit would wish itself or indeed better than thus.
4-(5). Nor is the conception born of concordance. It indeed it be born of concordance, then to those exclusively who observe this concordance of diet and behaviour, there should be offspring and those whose lives are not so regulated should all be without issue. As a matter of fact both these conditions i. e. fertility and steri lity are seen alike in both classes.
4-(5). Nor is the conception born of nourishment. If it is indeed born of nourishment, then none among men and women should be childless, for there is no such among them who does not imbibe some kind of nourishment. If you say that what is meant is that to those alone who avail themselves of the best kind of nourishment children are born, even, so, only those who are nourished on the meat of goats, sheep, deer, peafowl and on cow’s milk, curds ghee honey, til oil, rock-salt, juice of the sugar-cane, green gram and shali rice, should have children; while those who eat millet, Varaka, wild millet, bulbs and roots should, all of them, be childless. Both conditions, again, are seen in both classes.
4-(6). Nor, in fact, does a mind coming from another world, enter into the embryo. For, if the mind thus enters into the embryo, there should be nothing unknown, unheard or unseen pertaining to its previous incarnation. As a matter of fact one does not recollect anything of that kind.
4. Therefore do we assert this. The embryo is not born of the mother, nor of the father, nor of the spirit, nor of the concordance nor of the nourishment. Nor is there a mind which is the connecting agent. Thus declared Bharadwaja.
Atreya’s explanation
5. The sage Atreya replied, ‘No, for the embryo arises from all these factors acting together.
6-(1). In one sense, the embryo is born of the mother. For, surely, there is no conception in the absence of the mother nor without her is the birth possible of the viviparous class of creatures We shall now enumerate the mother-engendered parts of the embryo, that is, those which pass from the mother to the embryo during its formation.
The germoplasmic traits
6. These are—the blood, flesh, and fat, the umbilicus, the heart, the Kloman, the liver, the spleen, kidneys, bladder, pelvic colon and stomach, the colon, the rectum and the anus, the small intestine, the large intestine, the omentum and the mesentery.
7-(1). In one sense the embryo is born of the father also. For in the absence of the father, there is no conception too, nor without him is the birth possible of the viviparous class of creatures. We shall now enumerate the father-engendered parts of the embryo, that is, three that pass from the father, to the embryo during its formation.
The Spermo-plasmic traits
7-(2). These are: the hair of the head and beard, nails hair of the body, teeth, bones, veins, sinews, arteries and semen.,
8-(1). In one sense, the embryo is born of the spirit also. The embryonic spirit is the same as the in-dwelling spirit. It is called the embodied soul, eternal, diseaseless, ageless, deathless, undecaying, indivisible, unsunderable, immovable, omniform, omnifunctional, invisible, beginningless, endless and immutable.
8-(2). The spirit, entering the womb [i.e., garbha] and linking itself to the ovum fertilized by the sperm manifests itself as the embryo, for the embryo is known by the appellation of the spirit. To that spirit, however, being beginningless, there cannot be any birth in the true sense. Therefore, it is not true to say that, being itself first born, it engenders the unborn embryo; but verily being itself unborn, it engenders the unborn embryo. The self-same embryo, by the passage of time, reaches, in turn, the condition of childhood, youth and old age; and [is?] whichever condition it happens at the time to be, with reference to that condition it is said to be born, but with reference to that condition which is yet ahead, it is said to be unborn. Therefore, the selfsame spirit is said to be born and unborn at the same time. In which thing both these predications are possible, namely, having been born and having yet to be born; that thing, when born, is said to be engendered, and that very thing, again, with regard to its future vicissitudes, being ‘unborn’ engenders itself.
8-(3). The mere transition of an existent thing into another state is styled “birth” with reference to that new state or that new condition. Thus, for instance, prior to their union, spermatazoa, ovum and the spirit, though existing all the time, do not attain the status of the embryo, but acquire it only after their union. Thus also prior to the birth of a child, a man though existing all the time, has no claim to paternity, but it comes to him after the birth of the child. In the same manner, it is of the embryo, existing all the time, that the conditions of “having been born” and “having yet to be born” are predicated with reference to a given situation.
9 (1). However, neither the mother, nor the father, nor yet the spirit is in the total sense, an autonomous agent in the formation of the embryo. They (the mother etc.) act to some extent by themselves and to some extent under the compulsion of actions done iu a former life; again sometimes they are equipped with the means and sometimes they are not.
9-(2). Where there is the conjunction of means such as the mind etc., there the autonomy of the agent is limited only by the scope of the instruments; where no such scope is afforded, there is no autonomy. But on this score it cannot be contended that the spirit is incapable of engendering the embryo, because it happens that the instruments are defective. Moreover, the entering into the desired womb [i.e., garbha], the sovereign powers and the final liberation are regarded, by the theologians, to be applicable only to the spirit.
9-(3). For there is none else who is the subject of pleasure and pain. Nor from any source other than the self does the springing embryo take its rise; there is no rise of the seedling without the seed.
10-(1). We shall now enumerate the spirit-engendered parts of the embryo, that is, those that pass from the spirit to the embryo during its formation.
10. These are:—the birth in such and such womb [i.e., garbha]; the life-span; self awareness; the mind; the senses; respiration; excretory urge; the directing and sustaining powers of the various parts; distinctive shape, voice and color; pleasure and pain; desire and aversion; consciousness; resolution; understanding; recollection; egoism and effort. (These are born of the spirit.)
11-(1). In one sense the embryo is born of concordance too. For, without his or her being given to discordant diet or behaviour, there is no true sterility either in man or woman or any defective condition in the embryo. However, as long as the three humors, being irritated, overrun the bodies of those given to ill-regulated habits but do not penetrate deep enough to impair the semen in men, and the ovum and womb [i.e., garbha] in women, so long are these men and women capapable of procreation.
11-(2). On the other hand, even of those who are of well-regulated habits and possessed of defectless semen, ovum and uterus, and. who mate during the prescribed season, there is no resulting conception because of the non-descent of the spirit. The reason is that, conception does not result from the factor of concordance alone, but through the agency of the whole complex of factors.
We shall enumerate the concordance-engendered parts of the embryo i.e. those that pass from the factors of concordance to the embryo at formation.
11. These are health, freedom from sluggishness, absence of excessive or depraved appetites, clearness of the senses, excellence of voice, complexion, virility and sex-vigor.
12-(1). In one sense, the embryo is born of nourishment, too. For without nourishment the mother cannot even live, let alone bring forth her young. Nevertheless nourishment, improperly imbibed, does not conduce to conception; nor, to be sure, does conception result solely from the proper use of nourishment; here, too, it is the complex of factors that is said to be the cause..
12-(2). We shall enumerate the nourishment-born parts of the embryo i.e. those that pass from nourishment to the embryo during formation.
12. These are—the differentiation of limbs and their proper development, invigoration, satisfaction, plumpness and enthusiasm.
The Psychic element
13-(1). There is also the connecting agent which is the. mind. That which yokes the spirit with the sentient organism, that, on the imminence of whose departure virtue leaves the body, the inclinations change, all the sense-organs are distraught, strength wanes, diseases get aggravated, and finally on whose departure the organism is bereft of life, and which holds the senses together—this, is called the mind. It is said to be of three types—pure, passionate and inert.
13-(2). Now, of whatever dominant type a man's mind is in this life, he gets linked to that very type in the next birth. Thus, for instance, when he is linked to that very pure type of mind that he possessed in the previous existence, then he can recall the past incarnations as well-Hence memory follows the spirit, because it remains linked to the same mind; it is in consequence of this that a particular person is said to be a “Jatismara” i.e. one who remembers his past birth.
13-(3). We shall now enumerate the mind-born parts of the embryo, i. e those that pass from the mind, to the embryo during its formation.
13. These are-inclination, character, purity, hate, recollection, infatuation, liberality, envy, valour, fear, anger, torpor, enthusiasm, keenness, softness, profundity, fickleness, and such others; as also the conditions of the mind, which we shall later describe in connection with the analysis of mind. The mind is indeed of diverse dispositions; all these obtain in the same man but not at the same time. When a man is said to be of a particular disposition, he is said to be so by reason of its preponderance.
14. In this manner, this embryo comes into existence from the coming together of these various procreative factors like a tent from the assemblage of various materials, or like a chariot from the combination of various parts of the chariot. Therefore, did we assert this, that the embryo is mother-born, father-born, spirit-born, concordance born and nourishment-born. There is over and above the connecting agent, the mind.’ (Thus declared the sage Ātreya).
15. At this stage, Bharadvaja said, ‘If the embryo thus arises from the assemblage of various procreative factors, how is it integrated? And granted that the integration is effeccted somehow, why does the embryo, springing as it does from a complex, emerge in the shape of man? Now, man is said to be the offspring of man. If, then, it is said that, in as much as man is sprung of man, he emerges with a man’s form, as for instance, an ox is the offspring of au ox, or as a horse is the offspring of a horse; if this is the position, then what has been said before viz, that man is of the nature of a conglomeration, becomes untenable. If, moreover, man is the offspring of man, then why are those, sprung of the idiotic, the blind, the- hunchbacked, the mute, the dwarfish; the lisping, the deformed, the insane, and those suffering from dermatosis or leprous lesions unlike the parents? If, in order to explain away this difficulty, the assumption is that the spirit perceives forms by its own vision, sounds by its own audition, odors by its own sense of smell, tastes by its own sense of taste, the tangible objects by its own sense of feeling and ideas by its own understanding and on account of this, the offspring of the idiotic etc., are not like their parents. Even so, you are open to the charge of going back on your thesis, for, from what you now say it follows that the spirit is aware when the senses are present, and when they are absent it is not aware; and when both conditions obtain, then the spirit is aware in respect of those senses that are present and unaware in respect of those senses that are absent. It follows also that the spirit is mutable, if, then, by means of vision etc., the spirit perceives objects, then in the absence of sense-organs, deprived of vision etc, it is reduced to inertness. Since it is inert, it is no agent; and since it is not an agent, by the same token it is not the spirit. Thus, the whole argument is meaningless, with only words as its content.” (Thus said Bharadvāja).
Atreya’s Refutation of Bhardvaja’s view
16-(1). Atreya replied, “From the outset this has been our contention, viz., that the mind links the spirit with the sentient organism. We shall now explain why although springing from a complex, the human embryo emerges in the shape of man and also why man is spoken of as the offspring of man, There are four methods of propagation for living beings; from the womb, from the egg, from the sweat and from the seed.
16-(2). Among these four kinds of breeds, each single breed is of countless varieties by reason of the diversities of the shapes of creatures being countless.
16. Among these four main classes the embryo-forming elements, the viviparous and the oviparous creatures assume the shape of such wombs as those they get into, like gold, silver, copper, tin, or, lead that is poured into different, moulds fashioned of bee's wax. When they (the embryo-forming elements) find-themselves in the human mould, so to speak, they emerge in the human form. Thus the embryo, though springing from a complex of causative factors, emerges in the shape of man. This is why man is said to be the offspring of man, since such is his source.
17-(1). Now as regards the objection, why if man is man’s offspring, those sprung of the idiot etc., are not like the parents, we reply. Only that limb or organ of the body becomes defective, whose original representative part in the spermo-plasm has been rendered defective, if there is no potential defect there is no manifest deformity either. Therefore the position admits of. both possibilities.
17 In every case the sense-faculties are derived from the spirit; the presence or absence of these faculties is determined, however, by destiny. Thus it is that the offsprings of the idiot etc., are, not of necessity like their parents.
18, It is not that the self is aware when the senses are present and unware [unaware?] in their absence. The truth is that the self is never without the mind and because it is possessed of the mind it is also seen to be possessed of knowledge.
Here are verses again—
19- 19½. In the absence of the senses, the agent cannot manifest any activity. Whatever operation proceeds from certain factors, in the absence of those factors, it cannot take place. In the absence of clay, the potter, though skilful, cannot function.
20-21½. Now listen to the sovereign power of the knowledge of the self—spiritual knowledge. The knower of the self, having stilled the senses and the fickle mind, and having come into his own and being established in his own awareness, his vision extending everywhere, contemplates all existence-
22-23. O Bharadvaja, accept also this fresh conclusion. Having withdrawn from the activities of the senseorgans and speech, the sleeping man who has passed into the dream-state, cognises the objects of pleasure and pain; therefore the self is said never to exist without awareness.
24. There is no cognition of any kind without self-awareness; no consequent can exist independently or without a cause.
25. Therefore, the self is the knower, the archetype, the seer and the final cause. O Bharadvaja! all this has been definitely established; hence abandon all doubt.
Summary
Here are the two recapitulatory verses—
26-27. The cause of the manifestation, development and birth of the fetus; what the opinion of Atreya is concerning this subject; and what the opinion is of Bharadvaja; the objection to the proposition; the final conclusion concerning the self—all this, has been set forth in this minor chapter relating to the formation of the fetus [i.e., garbha-avakranti].
3. Thus in the Section on Human Embodiment in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the third chapter entitled ‘The Minor chapter on the Formation of the Fetus’ is completed.
The Conscious element in the Fetus
6. Looked at from this standpoint' the embryo is the sum of the modifications occasioned in the proto-elements and is the resort of the spirit; thus the spirit has been said to be the sixth element of the embryo.
7 (1). Now we shall explain by what stages the embryo develops in the womb [garbha].
7-(2). Now we have in mind the woman of child-bearing stage whose generative organs, ova and uterus are normal and who has gone through the purificatory bath on the completion of the last menstrual period with the fresh blood having replaced the lost blood. When, with a woman of this description, a man of unvitiated sperm unites in the sex-union, then, impelled by orgasm, there flows from every cell and tissue that quintessence of bodily secretions, the semen.
The Birth of the Fetus
7. That semen having thus been set into motion by the ecstatic self and informed by it, emerging from the man’s body mixes with the secretion of the woman after entering the womb through the proper channel.
8-(1). There in the womb [garbha], the conscious element (the spirit) which has the mind for the instrument, proceeds first of all to gravitate to itself the needed ingredients. This conscious element is, accordingly, said to be variously the cause, the region, the instrument, the imperishable, the agent, the thinking one, the knower, the understanding one, the seer, the dispenser, the great one, the universal architect, the omniform, the supreme person, the creative source, the unchanging, the eternal, the substratum of qualities, the seizer, the chief the unmanifest, the individual soul, the knower, the ego, the conscious one, the infinite, the soul of creatures, the soul of the senses and the inner soul.
8 This one, at the time of gravitating the elements to itself, draws the ether before the other elements. Just as at the close of the period of dissolution, the creative self, desirous of creating the world anew having the mind for his base first creates the ether; then, in due order, the remaining four elements, namely, the air and the other proto-elements, of more and more pronounced characteristics, even so, in procuring together to itself an individual body, it (the self) first takes the ether alone, and then in due order the other elements, having more and more pronounced characteristics, beginning with air. All this gravitating of elements takes place in an infinitesimal fraction of time..
The Fetus in the First month
9. The spirit having now become the embryo in the first month after conception being well compounded and tinged with all the elements, appears as a jelly-like mass of no particular shape and with, limbs emergent and latent
The Fetus in the second month
10.In the second month, this mass hardens into the form either of a knot or a tendon or an egg. Of these the knot-shaped is male, the tendon-shaped female, and the egg-shaped eunuch.
The Fetus in the Third month
11. In the third month, all the sense-organs and all the limbs emerge together.
12-(1). Some of the body-parts of the fetus have already been enumerated under various heads, such as those derived from the mother etc.. Now, we shall enumerate under different names with reference to the modifications of the five elements, the selfsame body parts as also some additional ones.
12. Even those parts derived from the mother etc., are in fact only modifications of their five basic elements, In the fetus the constituents of the ether are—sound, audition, lightness, fineness and space; those belonging to air are tangibility, sense of touch, roughness, impulsion, the marshalling and maintaining of the humors of the body and its movements; those belonging to light are form, vision, brightness, digestion and heat; those belonging to water are taste, the sense of taste, coldness, softness, unctuousness and wetness; those belonging to earth are odor, the sense of smell, weight, steadfastness and hardness.
The Similarity between the individual and the Universe
13. Thus, the individual man is an epitome of the universe. As much diversity of substance and quality as is found in the world outside, even so much exists in man; and as much in man, so much in the world outside. Thus the wise like to regard the nature of existence.
14-(1). Thus the sense-organs and the limbs of the fetus manifest themselves simultaneously. Apart from these phenomena there are some which appear after the birth of the infant; these are the teeth, secondary sexual signs, and signs of puberty and such other traits. This is the natural order; contrary to this is unnatural.
Now, in the fetus there are some characteristics which are permanent and some which are temporary. Those parts alone of the fetus which persist throughout life are called the primary signs of sex, whether male, female or neuter. Those distinctive (mutually exclusive) characteristics of man and woman are partly dependent on the self and partly on the material element; the sex differentiation is due to the preponderance of one or the other of these factors.
The distinct Features of the Male and the Female
14. Thus weakness, timidity, artlessness, confusion, fickleness, heaviness of the nether limbs, want of forbearance, frailty, softness, the uterine part occupied by the embryo and such other feminine traits determine the female sex; traits opposite to these determine the male sex. When there is an equal distribution of both these traits there is the neuter sex.
The Function of the Fetal heart in the Third month
15-(1). When the sense-organs appear in the fetus, at that very time, sentience lays hold of the mind. Consequently, from that time the embryo is seen to throb and yearn for this or that thing, experienced in the past existence; this condition is called the ‘bicardiac state’ by the experienced.
15-(2). The heart of the fetus, taking its rise from the mother, is connected with the mother’s own heart by the channels that carry nourishment; incidentally, inclinations are also conveyed by these channels. Having this fact in view, the wise do not wish to see the fetus baulked of its desires originating either in its own heart or in that of the mother.
15. For, from such thwartings, it is seen that the fetus is either destroyed or deformed. At this time the mother’s well-being in some respects is identical with that of the fetus; because of this the skilled physicians minister exceedingly to the pregnant women with endearing and wholesome things.
I6-(1). Now with a view to ascertain pregnancy and the bicardiac condition, we shall describe the symptoms in brief. Knowledge is essential for treatment; and knowledge comes from a study of the symptoms; therefore, the exposition of the symptoms is a desideratum.
16. These symptoms are:—the stoppage of menstruation, excessive salivation, dislike for food, vomiting, anorexia, excessive hankering for sour things, the exhibition of relish for all sorts of things, heaviness of the limbs, lack-lustre eyes, lactation, deep pigmentation of the lips and breasts, slight edema of the feet, growth of down on the abdomen, extension of the vagina—these are the indications of a growing conception.
The Gravida’s longings to be satisfied
17 The pregnant woman should be given whatever she desires with the exception of such things as would injure the fetus.
18-(1). These things will tend to injure the fetus, namely, all those that are very heavy, heat-producing or pungent, and all violent movements.
18. The elderly people prescribe these other measures too; in order to shield the fetus from angelic and demoniac powers and their followers, the expectant mother should not wear red habiliments nor indulge in intoxicating wines, nor ascend nor travel in a carriage, nor eat meat; in short, she should never come near anything that might injure her senses. She should also keep away from whatever else that experienced women declare to be harmful.
19. But if the longing becomes intolerable, it is better to give the pregnant woman in the desired object, be it injurious, havig [having?] neutralized it to whatever extent possible by the addition of a wholesome ingredient, so that the longing is removed. For, if the longing is completely repressed, the irritated Vata moving inside the body will either destroy or deform the fetus.
The Fetus in the Fourth month
20.In the fourth month the fetus becomes stabilised; consequently, the pregnant woman shows a pronounced increase in the body-weight.
The Fetus in the Fifth month
21. In the fifth month there is a greater increase, to the fetus, in the accession of flesh and blood than during other mouths. Therefore, at this time, the pregnant woman becomes exceedingly emaciated.
The Fetus in the Sixth month
22. In the sixth month there is a greater increase in the accession of strength and pigmentation to the fetus than during the other months; consequently, at this time, the pregnant woman loses strength and color exceedingly.
The Fetus in the Seventh month
23. In the seventh month the fetus develops in all ways; therefore, at this time, the pregnant woman becomes exceedingly restless i.e. tired.
Exchange of Vital essence in the Eighth month
24-(1). In the eighth month, on account of the yet incomplete formation of the fetus, there is a continuous transmission of vitality from the mother to the fetus and vice versa by means of the channels that carry the body-nutrient fluid.
24. Therefore at this time the pregnant, woman becomes momentarily joyful and momentarily distressed; in the same manner, also the fetus. Hence at this time the birth of the fetus is attended with risk because of the instability of the vital essence It is on account of this consideration that the learned say that the eighth month is not to be reckoned upon.
The time for Delivery
25. If the eighth month is passed even by a day, the ninth month having come in, thence till the tenth month is the period of delivery. This is the normal period of delivery. If the fetus stays longer in the womb [garbha], it is abnormal.
26. Thus, by these stages, the fetus develops in the womb.
The Growth of the Fetus in the womb
27. The fetus waxes in the womb by the excellence of the parts derived from the excellence of the expectant mother’s regimen and the Upasveda and Upasneha procedures, the passage, of time and finally from the course of nature.
28. It is exclusively on account of some defects in the embryo-formings elements like the mother etc., that the fetus fails to get born.
29. It. is on account of the retardation of the processes which we have, described as helping the growth of the fetus in the womb, that the fetus gets destroyed or, in the alternative, is prematurely delivered.
30-(1). We shall now explain how the fetus not being wholly destroyed, is, however, deformed.
30-(2). If a woman who is habituated to things that are apt to irritate the three humors, which being thus irritated, spread through the body and reach the generative organs, without, however, completely vitiating them, if such a woman conceives, then of that conception, one or more of the parts deriving from the mother will be rendered defective, the defect being limited to those limbs whose parent parts in the germo-plasm are vitiated by reason of the (irritated) humors.
The Fetal defects due to defects of the germo-plasm
30. Thus for instance, if the uterine parent part of the embryo is vitiated, then the. mother gives birth to a barren female. If again only a part of the germo-plasm is vitiated, then she gives birth to a Putipraja. If again the uterine part of the fertitized ovum and that part of the fertilized ovum which is responsible for the differentiation of female characteristics get partially vitiated, then she gives birth to a non-female having however abundance of female characteristicsand named ‘Varta [Vārtā]’ Such a person is spoken of as a female deformity.
31. Similarly, if the male-procreating element of the semen is vitiated there results a sterile male; if again the male-procreating part of the semen of a man is partially vitiated, then there results a male called ‘Putipraja [Pūtipraja]’. If the male-procreating part of the semen and those parts of the semen which give rise to the differentiation of the male characteristics are partially vitiated, there results a non-man having a number of male characteristics, and named ‘Trinaputrika [Tṛṇaputrika].’ He is spoken of as a male deformity.
32. Thus, the conditions we have shown, concerning the defects originating from either the father or the mother, are also to be applied in the case of defects originating from the other factors such as concordance, nutrition and also the psychic factor.
The changeless Nature of the Spirit
33. The supreme spirit is ever defectless and is the same in all living beings; but on account of the difference in mind and body, it appears to be different.
34. Now, there are three vitiating elements in the body, namely, Vata, Pitta and Kapha; these vitiate the body. As regards the mind, there are two vitiating, elements, namely, passion and ignorance. Disease takes its rise as the result of the vitiation of the two—the body and the mind; it cannot manifest if they remain unvitiated.
The Varieties of the Soma
35. Of these two, the body is of four kinds, on account of the manner of propagation as shown previously.
The Varieties of the Psyche
36-(1). The mind is of three kinds—pure, passionate and ignorant. The pure mind is considered to be without any taint as it represents the beneficient aspect of the intelligence; the passionate mind is tainted as it represents the violent aspect: the ignorant mind. is also tainted on account of its representing the deluded aspect.
36. Each of these three types of mind reveals an infinite number of variations on account of the differentiating factors of degree, origin and body, and the mutual concomitance of body and mind. Thus a particular type of body goes with a particular type of mind; and conversely a particular type of mind with a particular type of body. In order to illustrate, this, we shall now enumerate, by way of examples, several different intellectual types.
37-(1). One who is pure, devoted to truth, self-controlled, of right discrimination, endowed with knowledge, understanding and power of exposition and reply, possessed of memory, free from desire, anger, greed, conceit, infatuation, envy, dejection and intolerance and equally well disposed to all creatures is to be known as belonging to the Brahma type.
37-(2) One who is devoted to sacrifice, study, vows, burnt-offerings, celibacy, who is hospitable, devoid of pride, conceit, attachment, hate, infatuation, greed and anger, and is endowed with genius, eloquence, understanding and retentive power is to be known as belonging to the Rishi [Ṛṣi] type.
37-(3). One who is endowed with lordship, is of authoritative speech, given to the performance of sacrifices, brave, energetic, endowed with splendour, given to blameless actions possessed of foresight and devoted to the pursuits of virtue, wealth and sense-pleasures, is to be known as belonging to the Indra type.
37-(4). One whose conduct is governed by considerations of propriety, who does the right thing, is unassailable, who is constantly up and about, who is endowed with good memory, who sets store by authority and power, and who is free from the passions of attachment, envy, hate and infatuation. is to be known as belonging to the Yama type.
37-(5). One who is valiant, courageous, clean, intolerant of uncleanliness, devoted to the performance of sacrifices, fond of aquatic sports and given to pursuits which are not blame-worthy, and whose anger and favour are well-placed, is to be known as belonging to the Varuna type.
37-(6). One who commands status, honor, luxuries and attendants, who is devoted to the constant pursuit of virtue, wealth and pleasure, who is clean, and given to the pleasures of recreation, and whose modes of auger and favor are patent, is to be known as belonging to the Kubera type.
37-(7). One who is fond of dancing, song, music, and praise, and is well-versed in poetry, stories, history and legends, who is constanty [constantly?] addicted to the pleasures of fragrant unguents, garlands, ointments, fine rament [raiment?], women and recreation and is free from envy, is to be known as belonging to the Gandharva type.
37. Thus, the Sattvic type is of seven varieties; they are all of the beneficent kind The first variety—the Brahma, is to be considered the purest, for, the benificent aspect of the mind is perfectly represented in it.
38-(1). One who is valiant, despotic, of an envious disposition, possessed of authority, given to poses, terrifying. pitiless, and fond of self-adulation is to be known as representing the Asura type.
38-(2). One who is intolerant, of implacable hate, bides his time and then strikes, is cruel, gluttonous, inordinately fond of flesh-foods, of an excessively somnolent and indolent dis position and envious, should be known as representing the Rakshasa [Rākṣasa] type.
38-(3). Oue who is a great eater, uxorious, fond of keeping company of women in secret, unclean, a hater of cleanliness, a coward, a bully, given to abnormal recreations and diet is to be known as representing the Pishaca [Piṣāca=Piśāca?] type.
38-(4). One who is brave when excited, touchy, of an indolent disposition, who arouses fear in the beholder and is devoted to food and pleasures of recreation is to be known as representing the Sarpa (serpent-type.
38-(5). One who is fond of food, whose character, conduct and pastimes are of a very painful description, who is envious, who is without discrimination, who is very covetous and who is disinclined to work should be known as representing the Preta (ghost) type.
38-(6). One who is of strong attachments, who is constantly devoted to the delights of eating and recreation, is fickle, intolerant and unacquisitive is to be known as representing the Shakuna [Śakuna] (bird) type.
38. Thus the Rajasa type is to be known as comprising six varieties; they are all tinged with passion.
39-(1). One who is of a forbidding disposition, unintellectual, disgusting in his behaviour and dietetic habits, abandoned to sex pleasures, and given to somnolent habits is to be known as belonging to the Animal type.
39-(2). One who is pussilanimous, unintelligent, greedy for food, unstable, of persistent likes and dislikes, of itinerant habits and fond of water is to be known as belonging to the Fish type.
39-(3). One who is lazy, exclusively devoted to the business of eating and devoid of mental faculties is to be known as belonging to the Vegetable (plant) type.
39. Thus, the Tamasa type should be known to comprise three varieties; they represent the inert aspect of the mind.
40. In this manner, we have described a few of the innumerable varieties to be met with in the three types of mind with a view to indicating the general nature of the treatment to be given in each type. Thus, we have classified the Sattvic type under seven heads according as they correspond to the psychic types of Brahma, Rishi, Indra, Yama, Varuna, Kubera and Gandharva; the Rajasic type under six heads according as they correspond to the psychic types of Daitya, Pishaca, Rakshasa, Sarpa, Preta and Shakuni; and finally the Tamasic type under three heads according as they correspond to the psychic types of Animal, Fish and Vegetable life.
41. Thus, the intention with which this topic of the formation of the fetus was begun, has been achieved in full and agreeably to the purpose set out. By understanding what has been laid down here, one is enabled to promote those influences which are conducive to the rise and growth of conception and to inhibit those which are inhibitive of conception and its subsequent development.
Summary
Here are the recapitulatory verses—
42. The instrumental cause, the embryonic self, the material cause, the gradual development in the womb [garbha] and the factors promoting the growth; these five, in relation to the fetus, are declared to be the auspicious topics in embryology.
43. The factors which tend to inhibit conception or to destroy it after it has taken place or to render it defective—these three factors, inimical to the formation and growth of the fetus, are said to be the inauspicious topics.
44- The physician who is fully conversant with all these eight topics divided into the auspicious and the inauspicious is entitled to wait on the king.
45. The physician of large understanding requires to know both these sets of factors, viz., those which are helpful in the formation and development of the fetus and those which are inhibitive of such formation and growth.
4. Thus, in the Section on Human Embodiment in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the fourth chapter entitled “The Major chapter on the Formation of the Fetus [i.e., garbha-avakranti]” is completed.
The Cause of the Life-process
9. Then Agnivesha said, ‘O, revered Sir! what are the springs of action aud what is the means towards inaction?’
10-(1). The worshipful one said, “ction springs from behaviour impelled by delusion, desire and hate. Born of it are egoism, attachment, doubt, vain-glory, wrong identification, wrong judgement, absence of discrimination and the wrong means As trees with wide sweeping branches smother a tender sapling, so these raise themselves at the expense of man, who being overpowered by them, is unable to transcend action.
10-(2). Now, ‘I am endowed with such race, looks, wealth, conduct, intelligence, character, learning, lineage, period of life, vigor and capability’—this notion is egoism. Whatever action—mental, vocal or bodily, which is not conducive to final emancipation, is called attachment; questioning such facts as the results of action, liberation and human survival after death is called ‘doubt’. The notion, ‘I am a unitary personality through all vissicitudes, I am the creator, I am perfect by nature I am the unique conglomeration of the body, the senses, intelligence and recollection’—this is vainglory ‘The mother, father, brother, wife, child, kinsman, friend, servant etc, are mine and I am theirs’—this is wrong identification. Erroneous conception of what is enjoined and prohibited, the beneficial and the harmful, and the good and the evil, is wrong judgement. The confounding of the knower with the non-knower, the original with its modifications, and action with inaction, is absence of discrimination. And lastly, the wrong means are said to be such undertakings as the ceremonial sprinkling of water etc., in sacrifices, fasting, the keeping of the sacred fire, the three diurnal baths, ceremonial spraying, invocation, officiating at another’s sacrifice, sacrificing for oneself, mendicancy and entering the waters or fire etc.
10. Thus man, dispossessed of right understanding, resolution and recollection and taken possession of by the ego and attached to action and given to doubt, his understanding clouded with conceit, and merging himself in his environment with distorted vision, lacking discrimination and going astray, becomes the dwelling tree of all afflictions which have for their root-cause debits of the body and the mind. In this manner, being borne about hither and thither by the evil forces of egoism etc., man is unable to transcend the vicious chain of causation, which indeed is the mainspring of all evil.
The Nature of Emancipation
11. Non-action which breaks the chain of causation, is the ultimate dissolution. That is the highest, the final peace; that is the indestructible, that is Brahma, and that is liberation.
The Means of Emancipation
12. We shall now describe the upward-leading path of those who seek liberation. The seeker after final emancipation, who has seen the vanity of the world, should first make his approach to a teacher whose teaching he should then put into practice. Thus, he should tend the ceremonial fire, study the sacred law-books, understand their meaning and taking them for his guide should mould his conduct thereby. He should seek the good and avoid the evil; he should eschew the companion of the wicked; he should speak only that which is true, conducive, to the good of all creatures, gentle, season-able and well-considered. He should regard all creatures as himself. He should avoid all reminiscence, desire, entreaty and discourse with women aud renounce all possessions retaining only the following appurtenance: a loincloth for cover and an ochre colored garment, and for mending it a case of sewing needles. For the sake of cleanliness, he may carry a water-pot and as a mark of his order a mendicant’s staff and a bowl for collecting alms. He may substitute alms by such natural food as is easily available in the woods and just enough to maintain life. If he is fatigued, he may take his rest on a bed improvised with dry fallen leaves and weeds, but he should not do this habitually. He may keen an arm-rest as an aid in meditation. He should dwell in the woods and have no roof over his head, avoiding drowsiness, sleep laziness etc He should check desire and aversion to sense-objects. He should exercise circumspection in sleeping, staying, moving, seeing, eating, recreation and in fact in the movement of every individual limb. He should be indulgent alike to honorable treatment, adulation, contempt and humiliation, and should be able to put up with hunger, thirst, fatigue, strain, cold, heat, wind, fain, pleasure and pain. He should be unmoved by grief, depression, self-conceit, affliction, arrogance, greed, attachment, envy, fear, anger etc. He should look on egoism etc., as causative of suffering, and on the macrocosm and microcosm in the matter of creation etc., as being identical. He should [dread?] procrastination and should never feel disinclined to practise yoga. He should be of an enthusiastic frame of mind. He should bend all his powers of understanding, resolution and recollection towards final emancipation; he should restrain the senses by means of the mind, and the mind by means of the Spirit and the Spirit by itself. He should constantly revolve in mind the categories giving rise to the body and its members and should resolve that every thing that has causation is not the self, is fraught with pain and is transient. He should regard all activity as tainted with evil, and hold the conviction that in the renunciation of all things is true happiness. This is the path leading to final emancipation; straying from this, one is bound. Thus have we described the upward leading steps.
The Nature of the Pure mind
Here are verses again—
13. By these purifying means, the impure mind is cleansed, just as a looking-glass is cleansed by being rubbed with such things as oil, cloth and brush.
14. The purified mind, thereafter, shines like the sun’s orb that has come out of an eclipse, water-vapour, dust-cloud, smoke-cloud or fog.
15. That mind, stabilized in the self, shines like the pure, steady and luminous flame of a lamp kept in a closed lantern.
16-19. That pure and true understanding, which accrues to the man of purified intellect, is variously understood as learning, achievement judgement, genius, comprehension and knowledge. By this, he breaks open the exceedingly strong citadel of the darkness of the great illusion. By this, realizing the true nature of all things, he becomes desireless; by this, he masters yoga; by this, he attains the knowledge of the categories; by this he stands clear of egoism; by this, he does not come under the power of causation; by this, he gives up taking refuge in anything; by this, he renounces all; by this, he finally attains Brahma, the eternal, the undecaying, the unagitated and the imperishable. That is regarded as the true science, attainment, psychic state, intelligence, knowledge and wisdom.
20. He who sees himself as extended in all the world and all the world in himself, the peace of that surveyor of this (i.e. Spirit and matter) and the yonder, being rooted in knowledge, does not perish.
21. Witnessing all existences in all their conditions and at all times, he who has become Brahma, the pure one, cannot come into contact with any thing.
The Nature of the Liberated soul
22. In the absence of the cognising instruments, no characteristics can be observed in the self. Hence, by the disjunction of all instruments, he is said to be liberated
23. The peace of the liberated is spoken of by such synonyms as sinlessness, passionlessness, tranquility, the supreme, the imperishable, the changeless, immortality, Brahma aud the final rest.
24. O, gentle one! this is that unique knowledge, having known which, the sages, freed from doubt, entered the great peace, having cast off delusion, passion and desire.
Summary
Here are the two recapitulatory verses—
25. The similarity of man and the universe, together with the utility of such knowledge, the origin of the soul’s bondage and the means for release therefrom, have been described.
26. The concentration of the pure mind, the true and absolute understanding, and the goal—all this, has been taught by the great sage in this chapter on the “Analysis of Man.’
5. Thus, in the Section on Human Embodiment in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the fifth chapter entitled “The Analysis of Man [i.e., purusha-vicaya]” is completed.
The Nature of the Body
4. The body [sharira] here means the ‘vehicle of equilibrium’, being the dwelling place of consciousness, and comprising the sum of modifications of the five great elements. When, therefore, the elements in the body become discordant, the organism suffers affliction or death. Now, the discordant tendency of the elements is brought about
by their tendency to hypertrophy or atrophy, whether partial or complete.
Simultaneous growth of All Body elements
5. The hypertrophy and atrophy of conflicting elements take place simultaneously. For, whatever factor serves to increase one element tends to decrease another element having the opposite disposition.
6. Therefore, medicine is that which, being well administered, becomes an equalizer of increased and diminished elements at the same time It brings down the excessive element and augments the deficient one.
The Maintenance of their Balance
7. Indeed, this alone is the end sought in the employment of medicine as also in the observance of wholesome habits, that the equilibrium of the elements may be achieved or maintained as the case may be. For it is only with a view to help to maintain the balance of the elements that the intelligent while being healthy, would make use, by rotation, of a dietary of tastes and properties which have been ascertained to be agreeable and balanced, while those who are given to the excessive use of one particular variety of food endeavour to balance it by recourse to effort that is known to be counter-active.
8. Right performance or use of acts, or dietary modes, that are counteractive to local, seasonal and bodily idiosyncrasies, the suppression of all extravagant tendencies, the non-suppression of the excretory impulses that are tending to go out and the avoidance of violent activities; wholesome living, comprising these, is taught to bring about the concordance of the body-elements.
9. Now the body-elements attain increase by the repeated use of dietary modes that either wholly consist of, or preponderate in, like qualities; while they suffer diminution by the repeated use of foods that either wholly consist of, or preponderate in, unlike qualities.
10-(1). Here these properties of the body-elements indicate the effective modes of the dietary etc. They are—heavy, light, cold, hot, unctuous, dry, dull, keen, stable, moving, soft, hard, clear, turbid, smooth, rough, subtle, gross, viscid and aqueous
10-(2). Of these, those body-elements which are heavy, grow more by the repeated use of such dietary modes as are heavy in quality, while the light ones grow less The light ones again grow more by the light foods; while the heavy ones grow less. In this very manner, there is increase of the tendencies of the body elements by the accession of like factors, and decrease by the accession of unlike factors
10. Consequently, the flesh-element grows more by the intake of flesh, relatively to the rest of the body-elements; similarly, the bloodelement increases by the intake of blood; the fat-element by fat; the flesh-marrow by flesh-marrow; the bones by cartilage; the bone-marrow by the bone-marrow; the semen by semen and the fetus by embryo.
11-(1). Now in places where dietary articles of absolutely like nature, in conformity to this rule of similarity, are not available, or even if available, the dietary at tides cannot be used either because they are unsuitable or because they are disgusting or because of some other reason, and nevertheless it becomes necessary to increase that particular body-element whose perfectly corresponding type of dietary article cannot be made use of, then recourse must be had to other types of dietary articles which abound in like properties to these of the body-element whose increase is sought.
11. Thus for instance, in diminution of semen, use may ba made of milk and clarified butter, as also of other articles listed as sweet, unctuous and cooling; in diminution of urine, use may be made of the juice of sugar-cane, Varuni wine and of ingredients having aqueous, sweet, acid, salt and moisture-producing properties; in diminution of fecal matter, use may be made of horse-gram, blackgram, mushroom, the viscera of goats, barley, vegetables, and the sour gruel of grains in diminution of Vata, use may be made of bitter, astringent, dry, light and cooling at tides; in diminution of Pitta, use may be made of sour, salt, pungent, alkaline, hot and acute articles; in diminution of Kapha use may be made of unctuous, heavy, sweet, viscid and turbid articles. Exertion, too, which is of the kind that stimulates the growth of a particular body-element whose growth is sought, should be indulged in. In this manner by the use of like and unlike food and exertion, the increase and diminution of the rest of the body-elements are to be brought about opportunely. Thus, we have explained, specifically and by indication, the methods of bringing about the increase and decrease of all the body-elements.
12.These factors promote the growth of the body [sharira] in every way. They are—opportunity, favorable natural endowment excellence of diet, and freedom from retardation
13.These factors promote the increase of strength. They are:—birth in a country of strong people, or at a time when people are strong, favorable opportunity, excellence of paternal and maternal endowment, excellence of nourishment, excellence of bodily constitution, excellence of regimen, excellence of the mind, excellence of natural endowment, youth, exercise and good cheer
14. These are the factors that promote the transformation of the ingested food into the body elements. They are—heat, Vata, moisture, unctuousness, time and their appropriate combination.
15-(1). Now, of these food-transforming agents, these are the various functions.
15. Thus, heat cooks, Vata lowers the food into its place, moisture renders it loose, unctuousness makes it soft, time completes the process, and the equilibrium of all these promotes metabolism and the concordance of the body elements
16. The several properties of the food, undergoing transformation into nourishment, convert themselves into the nature of such body-elements as are not inimical to their own, while they inhibit the opposing elements These, thus inhibited by the hostile food-elements, in turn retard the organism.
The Nature and Function of the pure and the impure Body-elements
17. The body-elements again are briefly of two kinds—impure and pure.
Of these, they are the impure which are hurtful, to the body. These are—excreta issuing outwards from the orifices of the body in various forms, putrescent humors, irritated Vata, Pitta and Kapha; also such other tendencies residing in the body as tend to injure the body; all these we regard as impurities and the rest as pure. All these again are listed, beginning with ‘heavy’ and ending with ‘aqueous’, according to difference in property, and beginning with ‘body-nutrient fluid’, and ending with ‘semen’, according to difference in substance.
Vata, Pitta and Kapha the vitiating factors of all Body-elements
18. Of all these elements, it is Vata, Pitta and Kapha alone that become the vitiators, being themselves first vitiated; for they are by nature vitiating. We have outlined the diagnostics of Vata etc., (the triad of faults) when they are vitiated in the rest of the body-elements and by reference to seasonal variation, in the chapter on ‘The various foods and drinks’. To the extent that there is contact with the body-elements, to that extent alone is the spread of corruption by corrupting influences. The result of Vata etc., when in natural state, is of course, health. The intelligent should therefore strive for the natural state of these three humors.
Here is a verse again—
19. That physician who understands the body [sharira] in every respect and in entirety and at all times, knows in its fullness the science of life, that is joy-giving to the world.
Agnivesa’s queries concerning the growth of Fetal limbs
20. Unto the sage Atreya, thus discoursing, Agnivesha said, “We have listened to this, that your reverence has spoken, on the subject of the body [sharira]. Now we desire to know this. Which member of the embryo first develops in the womb? In which direction does it face? What position does it assume inside the womb? What food sustains it? In what condition does it come out? Being born, by what wrong foods and ministrations does it get killed instantly? Again, by what right foods and ministrations does it grow without disease? Are there infantile disorders which result from the displeasure of the super-natural being or are there indeed no such? What does your reverence opine in the matter of the variety or otherwise of timely and untimely death of this man? What is his maximum longevity? And finally, what are the means for such maximum longevity?”
The opinions of the Sages on the Subject
21-(1). Unto Agnivesha who had thus questioned, the sage Punarvasu Atreya said, “As to how this fetus develops in the womb, what and when organic differentiation takes place, we have already explained in the chapter on the descent of the fetus. On this subject there are various conflicting theories of all the sage [?] aphorists. Listen to them being recounted—
21. “It is the head that first develops in the womb, seeing that it is the seat of all the senses,” thus views Kumarashira Bharadvaja. “It is the heart, because that is the seat of animation,” thus the physician Kankayana of Bahlika. “The navel, because it is the inlet for nourishment,” thus Bhadrakapya “The abdominal rectum, because it is the seat of motor activity”, thus Bhadrashaunaka. “The hands and feet, because they are the primary instruments of man,” thus Badisha. “The sense-organs, because they are the seat of perception in man,” thus Janaka Videha. “Because the embryo is hidden from the eye, it is uninferable”. thus Marici Kashyapa. “All the members develop simultaneously,” thus Dhanvantari. This last is acceptable; for all the members, headed by the heart, take the same time for development. Since the heart is as it were the main stem for all the bodily members, they being grouped round it and it is also the seat of several activities; therefore; there is no question of the prior manifestation of these others. Hence there is simultaneous manifestation of all the body-members, including the heart Indeed all organic functions are interdependent Therefore the objective view is the right view.
22. The fetus slays inside the womb with its face towards the back of the mother, its head above, and its limbs folded.
23-(1). Free from thirst and hunger, and its movements controlled by another than itself the embryo grows in the womb with dependence on the mother, by means of Upasneha and Upasveda, its limbs being but imperfectly differentiated[?]. Thereafter, the fetus is nourished partly by way of the pores in the hair-follicles and partly by way of the umbilical chord. To the navel of the fetus is attached the umbilical chord, to the umbilical chord is attached the placenta and the placenta is in turn attached to the heart of the mother; and it is indeed the mothers heart that floods the placenta by means of the pulsating arteries; the fluid thus transmitted is generative of strength and color, for it is indeed food containing all nutritive elements.
23.For, in a pregnant woman the nutritional juice is distributed in three ways—for her own nourishment for lactation and for the growth of the fetus, which being sustained by this nourishment, flourishes inside the womb
24. When the time for birth arrives the child is delivered, its head foremost, being turned over by the force of the birth-wind (uterine contractions), by way of the birth-path (vagina). This is the norm; other than this is abnormality. After this, the child becomes independent of the mother in its movements.
25. The prenatal nourishment and care taught in the “Jatisutriya” chapter help to prevent disease-conditions and promote proper growth.
26. By these very two (nourishment and care) improperly given, the child is killed as soon as born, just as a recently-planted tree is undermined by the wind and the sun
27. The disorders wrought in children by means of the displeasure of super-natural beings, not conforming to diseases born of irritated humors, may be known by authoritative instruction, by marking extra-ordinary signs in the young patient, and by the unusual nature of the etiology, symptoms and reaction to treatment.
Timely and untimely Death
28-(1). This is our conviction in the matter of the truth or otherwise of timely and untimely death. “Whoever dies, dies in good time, for there is no such thing as a gap in time (that is when there is no time),” thus some people argue. But this is improper. For there is no question of time having ‘gap’ or ‘no gaps’. Time is what it is, its own unique self.
28-(2). Here others declare—
“Whenever a man dies that is the appointed time of death for him; for time is the arbiter of all creatures and acts impartially.” This is also taking hold of the matter by the wrong end. Time’s impartiality is not established by the mere fact that there is none who does not die. For we speak of time in relation to the period of life. To one who would have it that ‘whenever a man dies, that is his appointed time of death, all other happenings too, whenever occurring, must seem to occur at the appointed time.’ Such a view is certainly unacceptable. Evident to our eyes are the undesirable consequences of untimely eating, speaking and performance as also the desirable consequences of contrary behaviour. With our eyes we see too, the distinction of timeliness and untimeliness regarding this or that thing, in this or that condition. Thus for instance, we physicians say, this is the time or this is not the time for this disease, this diet, this medicine, this counter-action, or this relief.
28-(3). In the world at large too, there is this usage: it rains in time; it also rains out of time. The cold is timely; the cold is not timely. The heat is timely, the heat is not timely. The efflorescence and fruitage are timely, the efflorescence and fruitage are not timely. Therefore, there is both, timely death and untimely death. There is nothing exclusively acceptable here.
28.If there were no untimely death, then all life should be of the appointed time-measure. Under such circumstances, the knowledge of the wholesome and the unwholesome would be purposeless, and all observation, inference and instruction, which are regarded as being valid in all sciences and by which we know what promotes and what curtails longevity, would be invalidated. For these reasons, the sages consider this argument—that there is no untimely death, as merely a verbal display.
The Span of Life in this age
29. During this age the full measure of a man’s life is a hundred years.
30. To this end are the excellence of physical and spiritual endowments and the observance of right living needed.
Summary
Here are the recapitulatory verses—31-34. What the body is, how it functions., how it is afflicted by diseases, how it suffers pain and death., what are its elements, how they increase and decrease, how the deficient humors should be augmented, what factors promote the growth of the body [sharira] and what [???? because] [strength wh?] metabolic factors there are and what their individual function is what body-elements are known by the name of impurities and what by the name of purities, the ninefold question and the answer thereto—all this, has been presented truthfully and in due order by the great sage, in this chapter on the Analysis of the Body in the Section on “Human Embodiment”.
6. Thus, in the Section on Human Embodiment, in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the sixth chapter entitled “The Analysis of the Body [i.e., sharira-vicaya]” is completed.
The Six fold Nature of the skin
4-(1). “Learn from me with one-mindedness, O, Agnivesa! as O describe accurately, the entire anatomy of the human body.
4. There are six layers of skin in the body. These are as follows—the first is the external one or epidermis. The second is the Asrigdhara [asṛgdharā] which holds the capillary vessels. The third is the layer which is the seat of Sidhma dermatosis and leprous lesions. The fourth is the seat of ringworm and other similar types of dermatosis. The fifth is the seat of dry gangrene and abscesses. The sixth is that layer of skin which on being excised, one suffers violent shock and falls into a swoon and which is the seat of boils extending to the joints, dark-red in color, thick-rooted and most difficult of treatment These are the six layers of skin that cover the entire body comprising its six parts.
The various organic divisions of the body
5. The body [sharira] consists of the following parts:—the two arms, the two legs, the head and neck, and the trunk. These make up the hexa-partite body.
The Bone of the Body
6. Inclusive of the teeth and nails, it has three hundred and sixty bones. These are—(1) Thirty-two teeth, (2) thirty-two sockets of the teeth. (3) twenty nails, (4} sixty phalanges in the hands and feet, (5) twenty long bones of the hands and feet, (6) four bases of the long bones, (7) two heels, (8) four ankle-bones of the two feet, (9) two wrist-bones of the two hands, (10) four bones of the two fore-arms, (11) four bones of the two legs, (12) two knees, (13) two knee-caps, (14) two hollow bones of the two thighs, (15) two hollow bones of the two arms, (16a) two shoulders, (16b) two shoulder blades, (17) two collar-bones, (18) one wind-pipe, (19) two palatal cavities, (20) two hip blades, (21) one pubic bone, (22) forty-five back-bones, (23) fifteen bones of the neck, (24) fourteen bones of the breast, (25a) twenty-four ribs in the two sides, (25b) twenty-four sockets of the ribs, (25c) twenty-four tubercles fitting into the sockets, (26) one (lower) jaw-bone of the chin, (27) two basal-tie bones of the (lower) jaw, (28) one bone constituting the nose, prominences of the cheeks and brows, (29) two temples (30) four cranial pan-shaped bones. These are the three hundred and sixty bones Inclusive of the teeth, sockets of teeth and nails.
The five cognative organs and the five conative organs
7. There are five seats of the sense organs. They are skin, the tongue, the nose, eyes and ears. There are five cognitive senses. They are the faculties of touch, taste, smell, sight and hearing. There are five conative senses. They are the hands, the feet, the rectum, the sex-organ and the tongue.
The heart etc.
8. There is but a single Scat of consciousness viz., the heart.
9. The resorts of life are ten. They are the head, the throat, the heart, the umbilicus, the rectum the bladder, the vital essence, the semen, the blood and the flesh. Of these ten, the first six are considered to be vital organs.
10 The parts of the alimentary tract are fifteen They are the umbilicus, the heart, the Kloman, the liver, the spleen, the two kidneys, the bladder, the pelvic colon, the stomach, the colon, the rectum, the anus, the small intestine, the large intestine and the omentum.
11-(1). There are fifty-six subsidiary members attached to the six main members of the body [sharira]. These have not been enumerated in the foregoing description of limbs. They will be described according to a different method of classification.
11. They are:—two calves, two thigh musculatures, two buttocks, two testes, one phallus, two axilla, two groins, two flanks, one pelvis, one belly, two breasts, two shoulders, two arm musculatures, one chin, two lips, two corners of the mouth, two gums, one palate, one uvula, two tonsils, one tongue, two cheeks, two pinnae of the ears (hollow part of the external ear), two ears, two orbits of the eye, tragus and antitragus, four eyelids, two pupils of the eye, two eyebrows, one nape, two palms and two soles.
The nine orifices
12. Nine major orifices:—seven in the head and two in the lower part of the trunk.
13. So much is perceptible and easy of description.
14. Beyond this what is not demonstrated here is to be inferred. Thus, for instance, there are 900 sinews in the body, 700 vessels, 200 arteries, 400 muscles. 107 vital parts, 200 joints, 29956 terminal ramifications of the arteries and capillaries; and the same number (29956) of hairs of the head, beard and body. Thus, the body-parts which have been described here correctly are visible as far as the skin; parts interior to the skin are to be only inferred. Both classes of body-parts (those which are visible and those which are established by inference) co not reveal individual variation so long as the body remains normal.
The measure of the body-elements
15. We shall now describe those substances in the body [sharira] which are measured in “Anjalis” [añjalis] (a measure formed by joining both hands in the manner of a cup). The measures here laid down relate to the ideal standard. These measures accordingly admit of increase and decrease; these, too, are to be only inferred. Thus, the measure of the aqueous element in the body is ten Anjalis measured with one’s own hands This aqueous element is distributed in various ways; thus firstly it is found in association with fecal matter that is being excessively eliminated as also with urine, blood and other elements of the body; secondly, it is found all over the surface of the body, its seat being the external skin; thirdly, it is found below the skin as in an abscess, when it is given the name of lymph; and fourthly, it is found exuding from the hair-follicles driven by the body-heat, when it takes on the name of ‘perspiration’; all these kinds of the aqueous element are of the measures of the Anjalis. There are nine Anjalis of the first metabolic product of the inges ed food, which is spoken of as ‘the body-nutrient fluid.’ There are eight Anjalis of the blood; seven of fecal matter; six of mucus-secretion; five of bile; four of urine; three of flesh-marrow; two of fat; one of bone-marrow; half an Anjali of cerebrospinal fluid; the same measure of seminal fluid and the same measure also of the vital essence. Thus we have set forth the basic factors concerning the body [sharira].
16. Whatever in the body is predominantly made up of the following is referable to the proto-element earth—parts that are gross; firm, solid, heavy, rough and hard, viz., nails, bones, teeth, fleshy skin, feces, hairs of the head, face and body, tendons as well as odor and the sense of smell. Whatever in the body is predominantly made up of the following is referable to the proto-element water. Parts that are fluid, mobile, slow, unctuous, soft and viscid, viz., body nutrient fluid, blood, fat, mucus, bile, urine and sweat etc., likewise taste and the sense of taste. Whatever in the body is of the nature of Pitta, heat and radiating lustre as well as color and appearance, is referable to the proto-element fire. Whatever in the body is of the nature of inhalation and exhalation, opening and closing the eyes, contraction and extension, movement, impelling, holding etc as well as touch and the sense of touch are referable to the proto-element air. Whatever in the body [sharira] is of the nature of porosity, utterance and the channels that are gross and minute, as well as sound and the sense of hearing, are referable to the proto-element ether. The conscious principle, as also the mind and understanding; are referable to the primordial element—Pradhana. Thus have been indicated the broad divisions of the body-parts as well their number.
17. The constituent parts of the body, if further divided into the atoms, are sure to become innumerable, since such cells or atoms are exceedingly numerous, very minute, and ultra-sensory. In the conjunction and disjunction of cells, the activating factors are Vata and the nature of action.
The fruit of anatomical knowledge
18. This embodiment which has thus been described and consists of many parts, when viewed as an individuality, gives rise to bondage; when contemplated with the analytical outlook, it leads to salvation. The primordial element of the Spirit is not attached to this conglomeration. When all the motivating factors good and ill) have ceased to operate, the process of Samsara [saṃsāra] (the cycle of birth and death), comes to an end.
Here are the two recapitulatory verses—
19. The physician who knows the anatomical enumeration of the body together with a description of all its different members, is never a victim to the confusion arising from the ignorance thereof.
20. The wise man does not come under the sway the vitiating influences which give rise to delusion. Thus, freed of vitiating tendencies, devoid of desire, and established in tranquility, he attains pence and has no future birth.
7. Thus, in the Section on Human Embodiment in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the seventh chapter entitled “The Enumeration of the Parts of the Body [i.e., sharira-sankhya]” is completed.
The method of procreating offspring of the desired sex
3. We shall prescribe the regimen that will enable men and women of un-impaired semen or blood and uterus respectively, who desire excellent progeny, to secure their objective.
4.The man and woman should first be administered the oleation and sudation procedures, then cleansed by means of emetics and purgatives and thus gradually brought to a state of humoral concord. Purified thus, the couple should further be given the corrective and unctuous enemata. This should be followed, in the case of the man, by the administration of ghee and milk which have been prepared with the drugs of the sweet group and in the case of the woman, with the administration of oil and black-gram
5-(1). Thereafter, for three nights commencing with the onset of menstruation, the woman should abstain from sexual congress, should sleep on the floor, and eat her meals with her hands from an unbroken platter and avoid toilet,
5-(2). On the fourth day, she should be massaged, bathed and shampooed and attired in white raiment. So also the man.
5. Thereafter, the two, thus attired in white, wearing garlands, pleasant of disposition, desirous of each other, should co-habit, coming together on the even days, counting from the day of the purificatory bath if they seek a son, and on the odd days if they seek a daughter.
6-(1). During the sexual act the woman should not assume a prone posture, or lie on her side, for the peris-
taltic process becoming very powerful, presses on the womb. If the woman lying sideways. happens to be on her right side, the the phlegm being displaced, obstructs the entrance to the womb; if on her left side, then the Pitta in her being constrained, will burn up both her own ovum and the semen received from the man. Therefore the woman should receive the seed, while lying on her back. For in that posture the humors retain their respective positions. After the consummation, the woman should take a douche with cold water.
6-(2). It should be remarked here that if the woman has previously [? over-eaten or is famished?] or is thirsty, or is frightened, or is dejected, or is affected with grief, or is enraged, or loves another man, or is over-passionate, then she will either fail to conceive or will give birth to defective offspring.
6. A very young girl or very old woman, or a woman who is a chronic invalid, or one who is tainted with any other abnormality, should be eschewed as a partner. In the case of the man, too, these same are regarded as faults. Hence a man and a woman who are free from all defects should alone unite for procreation.
7.The couple, who are ardent and mutually attractive in the sexual act, having caused a pleasant-scented, well-spread and comfortable bed to be made, should after partaking lightly of a cordial and wholesome repast, ascend the couch, the man pacing[?] the right foot first and the woman the left.
8.Then, the following charm should be uttered apostrophizing the child that is to be:—‘Thou art the day; thou art the life, thou art well-established from all sides. May the supporter endow thee; may the dispenser dispense to thee; be thou born with the Brahmic splendour.’ ‘May Brahma, Brihaspati, Vishnu, Soma, Surya and the two Ashvins as also Bhaga, Mitra and Varuna, bless me with a hero so.’ Having uttered this, the two should unite.
9-(1). If the woman desires that she may obtain a son, large of limb, white, with eyes like those of a lion, full of vigor, pure and endowed with genius, then beginning with the purificatory bath, viz., the post menstrual bath, she should be given to drink a light porridge of white barley grain which has been well cleansed, sweetened with honey and mixed with ghee and diluted in the milk of a white cow having a white calf; she should drink it out of a silver or bronze vessel, regularly morning and evening for a week.
9-(2). In the forenoon, she should eat a dish prepared out of shali rice and barley mixed with curds, honey and ghee or with milk; similarly again in the evening. Her apartments, bed, seats, drinks, habiliment and ornaments should all be of the white color. At the evening and morning time without fail, she should gaze on a white majestic bull or stallion or white sandal paste. She should also be entertained with pleasant tales agreeable to her mood. She should feed her eyes on the sights of men and women of gentle looks, speech address and manners, as well as on sights of other objects that are white.
9. Her companions too, shall constantly regale her with pleasurable and wholesome things. So, too, shall the husband. The couple, shall, however, avoid sexual congress. Having in this manner passed the week, on the eighth day she shall lave her person, including the head, with waters, in company with her husband, and shall put on new raiment that is white and shall wear white garlands and ornaments.
10-(1). Thereafter, the priest having selected a spot to the north-east of the dwelling place, with a downward slope towards the east or the north, shall after smearing the ground with cow-dung and water, and sprinkling it with water, fix the altar.
10-(2). West of the altar, the priest shall take his seat either[?] on new piled cloth or on the skin, of a white bull, if he is officiating at the behest of a Brahmana patron; if at the behest of a Kshatriya, on the skin of a tiger or a bull; if at the behest of a Vaishya, on the skin of a deer or a he-goat.
10.Thus seated, he shall, having kindled the sacrificial fire with the twigs either of palas, zachum oil plant, gular fig tree, or mahwa, spread the small sacrificial grass round about, and fix the stakes to enclose the fire, bestrew the, altar-place with roasted paddy and with white and sweet smelling flowers. Then, fetching a water-pot, clean and sanctified, and rendering the ghee fit for offering, he should cause the horse etc., of the described color, to be placed at the four corners.
11-(1). Thereafter the woman wanting a son shall sit down to the west of the fire and to the south of the priest and together with her husband shall offer the oblation, expressing her longing for the son of her heart. Unto her, thus expressing her wish, the priest addressing the God of pro creation for the fructification of her desire in her womb, shall perform the boon conferring sacrifice, by chanting the hymn, ‘May Vishnu fecundate the womb’ etc. Then, mixing the oblation with the holy ghee, he should offer it thrice to the fire, reciting the appropriate vedic hymns. He should then give the sanctified pot of water to the woman saying; ‘Do thou use this whenever thou art in need of water.’
11. On the completion of the rite, she should, placing her right foot first, walk round the fire keeping it to her right and accompanied by her husband. Then, having obtained the blessing of the Brahman as, the couple should partake of the remains of the sacrificial ghee, first the husband and afterwards the wife, taking care to leave no part uneaten After this the two shall co-habit for a period of eight nights, wearing the cress etc., as prescribed above Tn this manner they will be able to procreate the longed for son
12 As regards the woman who wishes for a son, dark-hued, red-eyed, broad-chested and mighty armed, or as regards a woman who seeks a son, black of hue, with black, soft and long tresses, gleaming of eye and teeth, radiant and high-souled. for both these, too, the sacrificial procedure is the same as described above. The paraphernalia, however, will not be of the same color but it shall be made, in either case, to match the color of the sought-for son, agreeably to the prospective mother’s desire.
13. As regards the Shudra-woman, the mere act of salutation to the gods, the sacred fire, the twice-born, the?e guardians, the saints and the adepts will suffice.
14-(1). On acquainting himself with the wish of a woman concerning the kind of son she would like to have, the physician, in attendance, should make her go over in her mind the countries of the appropriate description.
14. Then, coming to the people of the country whose racial type corresponds to the lineaments the woman has wished for, the physician should direct her, saying, ‘Thou shalt imitate such and such people in the matter of diet, recreation, care and paraphernalia’. Thus we have explained the whole procedure concerning the fulfilment of desire for sons
15. Nevertheless, the procedure we have laid down is not the only factor in the determination of complexion. There is also the light element, which when compounded mainly with the water and other elements, gives rise to the white color; when compounded mainly[?] with the earth and the air elements, it gives rise to the black color; when compounded equally with the other four elements, it gives rise to the dark color.
16.The factors that determine the different psychological[?] endowments of children are the various mental traits of the parents, the impressions received by the pregnant woman, the influence of one’s own past actions and special mental habits in the previous life.
17-(1). Of the man and woman whose bodies have been treated in the manner described above and who have paired together, the unvitiated sperm, coming in [?] contact with the unvitiated germ in the unimpaired uterus through the unobstructed vaginal passage, gives rise, of a certainty, to conception.
17. Just as on a clean piece of cloth rendered fit, a dye, compounded of coloring properties, by its very contact brings about pigmentation, so is it in this case; or just as milk, mixed with a few drops of cures, leaves by virtue of the mixture its own nature and takes on the nature of the curds, so does the sperm.
The Causes leading to the determination of Sex
18-(1). As for the factors determining the sex of the embryo that is thus brought into existence, these have already been mentioned.
18. Just as an unvitiated seed, when sown, reproduces its kind—the paddy-seed reproducing paddy and the barley-seed barley, in the same manner, men and women, too, reproduce the causative [divergences][?].
The Vedic ritual for the fixation of the male-sex
19-(l). We shall now teach the reversal of sex before its manifestation by means of the correct application of the procedure laid down in the medical scriptures. For observances that are well favored, as regards place and time, bear the desired fruit invariably; and contrary observances, contrary results Therefore, inspecting a woman who has newly conceived, the physician should, before the signs of gestation become apparent, administer to her the rite of “Pumsavana,” the rite of fixing the male-sex.
19-(2). Having culled two fresh sprouts, one each from easterly and westerly branches of a banyan tree growing in a cow-pen and dropping them together with two unbroken grains of black-gram or of white mustard-seed in curds, the woman should be made to drink it during the conjunction of the Pushya asterism with the moon.
19-(3). In the same manner, the paste of such drugs as Jivaka, Rishabhaka, rough chaff tree and crested purple nail dye, which have been treated either all together or separately, as prescribed, in milk or else such insects as the (Kuḍyakīṭaka [kuḍyakīṭaka] or Matsyaka) wall-insects should be swallowed by the pregnant woman having placed them in the water cupped by joining both hands, in the Pushya conjunction.
19-(4). Likewise, in the Pushya conjunction she should swallow without leaving any part, images of men made of gold, silver and iron, flame-colored and minute in size having placed them in a handful of curds, milk or water.
19. Moreover, having inhaled the heat emanating from the flour of Shali rice while it is being roasted and placing the extracted juice of that very flour of Shali rice previously soaked in water, on the threshold, the pregnant woman should herself drop the juice into her right nostril by means of cotton-wool. Moreover, whatever else that the Brahmanas or well-meaning women may declare as desiderata in the rite of ‘Pumsavana,’ all that shall the expectant mother do. Thus we have dealt with the ‘Pumsavana’ observances.
The protection of the conception
20-(1). We shall hereafter indicate the measures that preserve a conception. These are:—the wearing of the herbs, Aindri, Brahmi [brāhmī], Shatavirya [śatavīryā], Sahasravirya [sahasravīryā], emblic myrobalan, guduch, chebulic myrobalan, neem, evening mallow and perfumed cherry by the pregnant woman in her head or on her right hard, the drinking of milk or ghee treated with these very herbs, or bathing at every Pushya conjunction in water that has been prepared with these very herbs, and regular massage with these herbs.
20. Similarly, the regular use of all the drugs included in the lifepromoter group in the prescribed manner. Thus, we have set out the measures that preserve a conception.
21-(1). The following factors tend to destroy or impair a conception that has taken place. Thus, in a woman who is given to sitting on awkward, uneven and hard seats, or inclined to supress the urges for flatus, urine and feces, or accustomed to indulge in violent and extravagant forms of exercise, or addicted to pungent and hot things in an excessive measure, or used to eating very sparingly, the fetus dries up in the womb or is delivered prematurely, or becomes atrophied.
21-(2). Similarly by suffering trauma or compression or by looking down into abysses, deep wells or steep falls frequently, the expectant mother is liable to miscarry at once; similarly, she is liable to miscarry by travelling in very jerky carriages, or by listening to unendearing and very loud sounds.
21-(3). Again of her who is constantly addicted to sleeping on her back, the umbilical chord attached to the navel of the fetus winds itself round the throat of the fetus, thus tending to strangulate it. The woman who sleeps in the open air or is addicted to night-walking will give birth to congenitally insane offspring; a shrew or virago to an epileptic; a nymphomaniac to ill-formed or shameless or effeminate offspring; a hypochondriac to pussilanimous, emaciated, or short-lived offspring; a scheming woman to anti-social, envious or effeminate offspring; a thievish woman to a drudge, a great traitor or an evil doer; an intolerant woman to a fierce, deceitful and envious offspring; one addicted to sleep to a sluggard, a dullard or a dyspeptic; one addicted to wine to a hydromaniac, forgetful or fickle-minded offs ring; a woman who is given to eating iguana’s flesh, to children suffering from urinary gravel, calculus or from dribling micturition; a woman who is addicted to hog’s flesh to offspring suffering from bloodshot eyes, sudden apnea or coarse hair; a woman who is fond of the meat of fish to a slow-winking or unwinking offspring; a woman constantly given to eating sweets to an offspring subject to urinary anomaly or a mute or obese offspring; a woman who is fond of sour things to offspring suffering from hemothermia or diseases of the skin and eyes, a woman who is fond of saline things, to offspring that quickly go grey and wrinkled or bald-headed; a woman who is fond of pungent things to a weakling or to one who is deficient of semen or sterile; a woman who is addicted to bitter things to consumptive. weak or emaciated offspring, a woman who is addicted to astringent things, to one who is muddy of complexion, constipated or suffering from misperistalsis. In short a pregnant woman who is addicted to whatever has been laid down as causative of disorders will give birth to issue, tainted for the most part, with diseases corresponding to those factors, What we have slid concerning the malpractices of the expectant mother applies equally till the time of conception to the father who transmits his defects through the semen. Thus, we have declared the abortofacient factors.
21. Accordingly, a woman who desires the blessings of children should in particular eschew unwholesome diet and activity, and conducting herself well, should avail herself of wholesome diet and activity.
22-(1). The disorders of a pregnant woman should be treated by means of medicaments and diet that are mainly soft, palatably cooling, pleasant and delicate, nor should, she be administered emetics, purgatives, of errhines, nor should her blood be let, nor at any time, should she be administered the corrective and unctuous enemata, excepting in very serious emergencies.
Care of the Gravida
22. From the eighth month onward, in urgent disorders which yield only to emesis etc., the patient should be treated by means of gentle emetics etc., or by substitutes. Like a pot brimful of oil should a pregnant.woman be han lied, without being upset in any way.
23. If, as the result of wrongful behaviour, menstruation occurs in a pregnant woman either in the second or the third month, one should conclude that the conception will not stand, for <he embryo, during this period, is still immature.
24-(1) As regards the menstruation that occurs in the fourth month or after, in consequence of an excessive measure of anger, grief, intolerance, envy, fear, sex-act, exercise, agitation, suppression of body urges, faulty eating, lying down and standing, excessive hunger and thirst or as the result of mal nutrition, we shall declare the method of safe-guarding the conception against mishap
24. As soon as the menstrual discharge is noticed, the patient should be instructed thus:—“Lie down on a soft easy, cool and well-[???] couch with the head slightly lower than the neck and the body.’ The physician should then place near the vagina of the patient a pad of cotton dipped in ghee mixed with liquorice and kept in ice-cold water. Thereafter, he should smear her entire region below the navel with the hundred times washed ghee or the thousand times washed gbee. He should then affuse her body below the navel with cow’s milk or very cold decoction of liquorice or with the infusion of the banyan bark; or in the [alternative?? have] her with very cold water. He should then insert pieces of cloth which have been soaked in juices of milk-yielding and astringent plants, or in the alternative he should insert [cotton-wool][?] dipped in the milk or ghee treated with the sprouts of the banyan etc. He should then make her drink two tolas weight of ghee extracted from milk. He should then give her as a linctus the pollen of the day-lotus, the black-lotus and the night-lotus, mixed with honey and sugar, and make her eat the roots of Indian water-chestnut, seeds of lotus and rushnut or he should cause her to drink with goat’s milk roxburg’s tree of beauty blue-lotus bulbs, unripe fruits of gular fig, and catkins of banyan. He should then cause her to eat soft boiled, fragrant and cooling red Shali rice together with, milk cooked with heart leaved sida, evening mallow, Shashtika rice and sugar-cane roots and Kakoli, sweetened with sugar and honey; or else he should cause her while seated in a place fanned by a gentle and cool breeze, to eat a dish of boiled rice of red Shali together with the meat-juice of common quai1, grey partridge, roe deer, [sambu?][?], rabbit, red deer, antelope and blacck-tailed deer, and seasoned with ghee. He should protect her from anger, grief, fatigue, sexual congress and exercises. He should see that she is entertained with talk that is gentle and pleasing to her mind. In this way her conception gets protected from abortion.
25. If menstruation occurs as the result of indigestion, then very often an abortion of the fetus cannot be averted, because the two disorders (abnormal menstrual disorder and indigestion) call for mutually opposed treatments.
The Nature of elephantine gestation
26-(1). If menstruation or other uterine discharge occurs as the reult [result?] of indulgence in hot and pungent articles of diet, in a woman with large and well nigh completely formed fetus, the fetus will cease growing, being displaced. Such a fetus will stay overlong in the mother's womb; this condition is referred to as ‘Upavistaka [upaviṣṭaka]’ or prolonged gestation.
23. Similarly, the fetus of a woman who is riven to observances of fasts and austerities, to mal-nutrition, to avoidance of unctuous articles and to indulge [???] that have been mentioned as provocative of Vata, will not develop, being [d??ed] nourishment. Such a fetus [will][?] tarry overlong and will not quicken. To this is given the name ‘Nagodara [nāgodara]’ (elephantine gestation).
24-27. shall here prescribe the line of treatment to be followed in the case of both these abnormalities. As regards the first, the use of ghees, milks and embryonic foods such as eggs, which have been medicated with life-promoting, roborant, sweet and Vata-curative drugs will stimulate the growth of the fetus; similarly, the sumptuous use of dishes cooked in the ghees etc., prepared in this manner, v. ill ensure adequate nourishment. This should be supplemented by walking and carriage exercise, by a rub-down and by the inducing of pendiculation
Its Treatment
28.As regards the patient whose fetus, being dormant, does not quicken, she should be put on a diet of red Shali-rice in conjunction with the meat-juice mixed with ghee, of one or the other of the following:-the hawk, fish, gayal, peacock, cock and partridge or with gruel of black gram or with the decoction of radish generously mixed with ghee. She should also be treated regularly [with][?] warm applications of til oil to the stomach, kidneys, pelvis, thighs, waist, sides and the back
Fetal tremors and other conditions of their treatment
29-(1). As regards the woman who develops acute constipation due to misperistalsis in the eighth month of her pregnacy, if the physician thinks that it will not yield to treatment by the unctuous enema, he should improvise evacuative enema for allaying the trouble. If the disorder of misperistalsis is neglected, it will spell the sudden end of both the mother and the child.
29. She should be given an enema consisting of the decoction of the roots of cuscus grass, Shali, Shashtika, small sacrificial grass, thatch grass, Ikshuvalika Vetasa and country willow and the decoction of bishop’s weed, Indian sarsaparilla, white teak, sweet falsah, liquorice and graces boiled in milk and diluted with an equal quantity of water, should be mixed with a paste, slightly saline and warm, made of the kernel of Buchanan’s mango, beleric myrobalans and til. This should be administered as euema. After she has been eased of her constipation and affused with pleasantly cold water and has eaten of a meal that gives firmness and is non-injurant, she should be administered in the evening an oily enema medicated with the sweet group of drugs. She should be treated with the corrective and unctuous enemata while in a prone posture
Removal of the dead Fetus
30. As regards her whose child dies in the womb as the result of either over-increase of the humors or the over-indulgence in pungent and hot things or suppression of urges for flatus, urine and feces or faulty eating, faulty sitting, lying down and standing or compression and injuries, or passion, grief, envy, alarm, fear etc., or other rash acts, the stomach is seen to be still, rigid, extended and as if there were a stone inside and the fetus had no quickening. There occurs severe pain in the s:omach, but the labour pains do not set in, there is non discharge, her eyes c roop, she feels faint, agonized, becomes giddy, breathes stertorously, end is full of weariness of life. Besides, she does not evince the proper manifestation of body urges, A woman who exhibits such symptoms is to he known as one in whose womb the fetus is dead.
31-(1). The treatment in the case if such dead fetus is said to consist by some in the expulsion of the placenta by medicaments by [others][?] the use of charms laid down in the Atharva Vede and by yet others in extraction by an experienced surgeon.
Care of the woman after abortion
31-(2). After the dead fetus has been removed while it is immature, the patient should be made to drink, at the outset, in accordance with her capacity, one or the other of the cordial wines—Sura and Sidhu, Medicated wine, Madhu, Madhira and Asava, with a view to cleansing the cavity of the womb and as a sedative for the pain and as an exhilerative. After this, she should be put on a diet, suitable for the convalescent period, consisting of articles of diet, that help to build up and nurse the strength, and of gruels unmixed with unctuous articles, keeping up this regimen only so long as the watery secretions of the vitiated humors have not dried up.
31. Thereafter, she should be given unctuous potions, unctuous enemata, and dietary articles which are considered to be stimulative of digestion, promotive of life, helpful to growth, and are sweet and curative of Vata. The patient whose dead fetus is mature and has been extracted, should be treated that very day with unctuous administrations.
32-(1). From here onwards we shall lay down the measures to be adopted month by month in the case of the conception that develops steadily without any disorder.
32-(2). During the first month when pregnancy is suspected, milk that has not been prepared with any drug and which is cold must be drunk in proper measure regularly, and whatever food is agreeable must be taken morning and evening. During the second month, milk prepared with the drugs of the sweet group must be taken. During the third mouth milk mixed with honey and ghee must be taken. During the fourth month butter extracted directly from milk should be taken in the dose of one tola. During the fifth month ghee extracted directly from milk should be taken. During the sixth month ghee extracted directly from milk and prepared with the drags of the sweet group should be taken. The same is to be continued during the seventh month. Women say that during that month, the mother suffers burning sensation inside as the fetus develops the hair then. But the worshipful Atreya says, ‘It is not so. But owing to the fetus pushing forward, the Vata, Pitta and Kapha reach the stomach-region, and cause the burning sensation. When there is cracking of the skin owing to itching, the woman should be made regularly to drink one tola of butter, prepared with the drugs of the sweet group in conjunction with the decoction of jujube. Her breast and stomach regions must be painted with the paste of sandal and lotus stalk or with the powder of siris, fulsee flower, rape-seed and liquorice, or with the paste of the seeds of kurchi aud shrubby basil, nut-grass and turmeric or with the paste of neem, jujube, holy basil and Indian madder, or with the paste of the three myrobalans in the blood of hog, deer, red deer and hare. She should be anointed with oil medicated with the juice of the leaves of oleander. The bath should consist of water treated with Arabian jasmine and liquorice. When she feels itchy she should not scratch for fear of lacerating the skin or disfiguring it. If the urge of itching is intolerable, it may be quieted by means of kneading and friction, massage. She should live on a meagre diet consisting of sweet and carminative articles and containing a little unctuous substance and salt, followed by small draughts, of water. In the eighth month, she should take, thin milk-gruel mixed with ghee, from time, to time. ‘This should not be done’ intervened Bhadra-Kapya, ‘for it may induce yellow coloration of the eyes of the fetus.’ ‘Let us grant that this produces the yellow coloration of the eyes,’ replied the worshipful teacher Atreya Punarvasu,’ but that in itself is not sufficient reason for not resorting to it, for by means of this, the expectant mother, preserving her own health, will give birth to a child endowed with excellence of health, strength, complexion, voice and build, and pre-eminent. in the whole clan. In the ninth month the pregnant woman should be administered enemata with oil medicated with the drugs of the sweet group. Cotton swabs dipped in this oil should be inserted in the vagina in order to lubricate the uterus and the. passage through which the fetus is to be delivered.
32. By recourse to the procedure here set out, commencing with the first month and ending with the ninth month during the period of her gestation, the pregant woman will secure the following benefits—softness of the placenta, womb, waist, sides and back, the proper functioning of the peristaltic movement, the easy excretion of normally constituted feces and urine, softness of the skin and nails, and the enhancement of strength and complexion. She will be able to deliver with ease and at the right time the longed-for child, possessed of health and all excellences.
The construction of the Maternity house
33. Before the commencement of the ninth month, the physician should get erected a lying-in-room on a site free from bones, sands and broken bits of earthen vessels, in a soil which is excellent with regard to color, taste and savour, facing the east or the north with the wood of bael, false mango-steen, Putramjiva [putraṃjīva], marking nut, three leaved caper and catechu or with any other wood which the Brahmanas who are knowers of the Atharvaveda recommend. This should be well-built, well plastered, and well-furnished with doors and windows and in accordance with the principles of house building; there should be arrangements for a fire-place, waterstorage, pounding, lavatory, bath-room and kitchen, and it should be comfortable in that particular season.
The Equipment inside it
34.The following articles should be kept there ready to hand:—ghee, honey, rock-salt, sanchai, black and bid salts, embelia, costus, deodar, ginger, long pepper, the roots of long pepper, elephant pepper, Indian penny wort, cardamoms, glory lily, sweet flag, piper chaba, white-flowered leadwort, asafoetida, rape-seed, garlic, clearing nut, Kana, Kanika, cadamba, linseed, Balvaja, birch, black gram and Maireya and Sura wines. Similarly, two grinding stones, an untamed bull, two gold or silver cases for keeping sharp needles, sharp metallic instruments, two bedsteads made of bael wood, and faggots of false mangosteen and zachum oil plants, for kindling fire. The female attendants should be numerous, being mothers of many children, sympathetic, constantly affectionate, of agreeable behaviour, resourceful, naturally kind-hearted, cheerful and tolerant of hardships. There should also be present Brahmanas who are knowers of the Atharvaveda. Whatever else is thought to be necessary should be kept; also, whatever else the Brahmanas and old dames advise, should be carried out.
35-(1). When the ninth month is running, on an auspicious day, when the sacred moon is propitious and favorable and is in conjunction with a favorable asterism as also the Karana is favorable and the Muhurta is friendly, having brought the cows, the Brahmanas, the fire and the water into the house at first, and having given grass, water and fried rice mixed with honey to the cows and to the Brahmanas, who have been presented water and seated, having offered colored rice, flowers and pleasant fruits indicative of good fortune, having bowed to them and having sipped water once again, the woman should seek their blessings.
35. Then, keeping the cows and the Brahmanas to her right and following them to the accompaniment of the benedictory cry, ‘This is a good day, the expectant mother should enter the lying-in room. Dwelling therein she should await the time of delivery.
Signs of impending delivery
36. These are the premonitory symptoms of approaching delivery. They are:—lassitude of the limbs, pallor of the face, heaviness of the eyes, freedom from oppression in the thorax, falling down of the fundus of the uterus, prominence of the lower abdomen, false pains or dolores presagientes in the region of the groin, hypogastrum, pelvis, upper abdomen, the loins and the back, the onset of the show and inappetence. After that, is the beginning of the true labor-pains and formation of the ‘bag of waters’.
37-(1). When labor-pain has started, the bed should be prepared of soft materials spread on the ground. The parturient woman should sit on it.
37. Then, the female attendants of the above-mentioned qualities should, surrounding her on all sides, wait on her, encouraging her, by comforting words and touch.
38-(1). If in spite of having severe labor-pains she is not able to deliver, she must be instructed as follows:-‘Get up! take either of the pounding clubs and strike repeatedly in the wooden mortar which is brimful of corn and pendiculate repeatedly and circumambulate in the intervals’. This is the advice given by some.
38-(2). ‘But that is not right’, says the worshipful Atreya, ‘for the pregnant woman is always advised to avoid violent exercise and particularly at parturition when in the delicate bodies of women all the body-elements and humors are in a state of commotion, and the Vata, irritated by the strain involved in the pounding, finding an opportunity, may destroy life. Moreover, the pregnant woman at that time becomes a most difficult subject for treatment. Hence, the sages are of the opinion that the pounding exercise should be avoided but that pendiculation and circumambulation should be resorted to.
38. She should be given to inhale the powder of the following things:—costus, cardamoms, glory lily, sweet flag, white-flowered leadwort, jungle cork tree and piper chaba. She should inhale these repeatedly and likewise the fumes of birch leaves or of the pith of the Bombay rose wood tree. During the intervals she should be rubbed over with tepid oil on the following parts—waist, sides, back and thighs and comfortably massaged. By this procedure the fetus slides down.
39. When the fetus, leaving the upper part, has descended into the lower abdomen, the head has become fixed in the pelvis and her laborpains have become more rapid, then the physician should know that the fetus has turned over and come down. At this stage she should be placed on the bed-stead and the delivery treatment begun. In her ear the favourite lady attendant should utter the following chant:—“May the earth, the waters, the heavens, the light, the wind, Vishnu and Prajapati ever protect you and the child and may they direct the delivery. O, auspicious-faced one! bring forth without distress to yourself or to him, a son who will possess the lustre of Kartikaya and will have the protection of Kartikeya.”
40-(1). The attending women, possessed of the qualities described, shall instruct her as follows:—“Don’t strain when there is no labor-pain. For as regards a woman who strains in the absence of labor-pains, her efforts are useless, her offspring becomes deformed or diseased or suffers from dyspnea, cough, dehydration and splenic disorders.
40-(2). As one, though straining to sneeze, eructate or expel flatus, urine dr feces prematurely in the absence of a natural urge, does not succeed or succeeds only with difficulty, similarly with the woman who strains prematurely in the absence of the labor-pains; just as again the suppression of sternutation etc., leads to injurious effects, so does the want of straining to deliver at the time of labor”. She should be told to do as instructed.
40.And acting accordingly, she must strain slowly in the beginning and gradually increase in force. To her who is straining to deliver, the attending women should cry thus: “She has delivered—delivered—a fortunate-fortunate son”. In this manner her spirits are exhilarated with joy.
41-(-). As soon as she has delivered, one of the attending women should make sure whether the placenta has come down or not. If the placenta has not come down, one of the attending women while firmly pressing down the patient’s abdomen just above the navel with her right hand, should, taking hold of the patient’s back by the left hand, shake her by the manipulation called ‘expression of placenta.’
41-(2). The patient’s buttocks should be pressed by the heels and taking hold of her thighs, they should be compressed tightly. Her throat and palate should be tickled with her braid of hair. Her vagina should be fumigated with the leaves of birch, quartz and the slough of a snake.
41-(3). The paste of costus and Himalayan silver fir diluted with the decoction of Balvaja or with the scum of Maireya and Sura wines, or with the strong decoction of horse-gram or with the decoction of Indian pennywort and long pepper, should be administered to her orally. Similarly the paste of small cardamoms, deodar, costus, ginger, embelia, long pepper, black eagle wood, piper chaba, white flowered leadwort and black cumin or slicing off the right ear of a live fierce bull and having mashed it up in a stone mortar and having soaked it for a while by placing it in any of the solutions of Balvaja group of decoctives etc., it should be removed, and the decanted solution administered orally.
41. A swab soaked in the oil prepared with dill, costus, emetic nut, and asafoetida should be inserted in the vagina. This very oil should be used as an enema, too. A corrective enema prepared of the above solutions with emetic nut, bristly luffa, bottle gourd, sponge gourd, kurchi, bitter luffa and elephant pepper should be given. This enema by regulating the peristaltic movement of Vata, will, while expelling flatus, urine and feces effect the expulsion of the delayed after-birth. The flatus, urine, feces and other excreta which normally tend to go outwards stick to the placenta inside and obstruct it.
Care of the New-born child
42-(1). On completing the procedure for the delivery of the after-birth, these are the measures to be carried out for the new-born child.
42. They are:—the striking of stones near the child’s ear and the dashing of cold and warm water in the child’s face. By these means the child regains the life-breath which was afflicted by the birth process. If it fails to revive by these methods, the child should be fanned with a winnowing basket made of reeds until respiration is established. All these measures should be carried out. Then, finding the child fully revived and naturally breathing, the toilet of the infant should be performed.
43. This must commence with removing the mucus from the palate, lips, throat and tongue by using the fore-finger which has been previously well manicured and wound round with a well washed swab of cotton. Having thus first wiped off the mucus, the child’s head and palate should be rubbed with a cotton swab containing unctuous substance. Thereafter, the emesis of the infant should be effected by a dose of ghee mixed with rock-salt.
44-(1). Thereafter should be done the ligature and clipping of the cord We shall now lay down the instructions concerning the ligature and clipping.
The Cutting of the navel-cord
44-(2). Measure out a length of eight fingers on the cord beginning with the root of the navel and carefully taking hold of the cord on either side of the mark, sever it with a sharp knife called ‘Ardhadhara’ made either of gold or silver or steel. Then having quickly tied a string to the stump, throw it loosely round the neck of the child.
44. If the navel shows signs of suppuration smear it with oil boiled with the paste of lodh, liquorice, perfumed cherry, turmeric and Indian berberry. The navel should also be dusted with the powder of these herbs. Thus has been laid down the correct procedure with regard to the ligature and clipping of the umbilical cord.
45. If the clipping of the cord has not been properly done, it may give rise to such affections as are extensive and elevated, Pindalika [piṇḍalikā], Vinamika [vināmikā] and Vijrimbhika [vijṛmbhikā]. In dealing with such disorders, the treatment should consist of oil-rubbing and spraying with medicaments and with medicated ghees that do not cause inflammation and that allay Vata and Pitta, with due consideration to the gravity or lightness of the disorder.
The Child’s Birth rite
46.Thereafter the infant's birth-rites should be performed. This is the procedure. The child should first of all be fed with honey and ghee that have been sanctified with the utterings of appropriate scriptural texts. Thereafter in the same manner the child should be suckled at the right breast first. After this a water-pot sanctified with the uttering of scriptural texts, should be placed near the head of the infant.
47-(1). Next, the following protective measures should be taken. Clipped branches of bitter luffa, catechu, wild jujube, tooth-brush tree and sweet falsah should be placed all round the dwelling house. The lying-in room should be bestrewn all over with rapeseed, linseed and whole and broken grains of rice. Likewise, the sacrifice of rice offerings should be performed regularly twice a day till the day of the naming ceremony. At the entrance, a pounding club should be laid parallel to the threshold. Sweet flag, costus, angelica, asafoetida, rape-seed, linseed, garlic, Kana and Kanika and drugs which are reputed to ward off the evil spirits should be tied into packets and suspended from the top beam of the door-frame of the lying-in room. Likewise, these packets should be hung round the neck of the new mother, as also round that of the son; packets should also be placed in the cooking vessels, the water pots and the couch, as well as at both sides of the threshold. Moreover, within the lying-in room there should always be a fire kept burning with the thorns of fragrant poon and the wood of the false mangosteen.
47. Also the women possessed of qualities mentioned earlier and who are well wishers, should keep vigil by the lying in woman for ten or twelve days. There should be incessant almsgiving, sounds of auspicious blessings, praise, song and of musical instruments in the house, and it should be gay with feasting and drinking and filled with well disposed and rejoicing crowds. A Brahmana who is a knower of the Atharvaveda, should regularly offer peace-offerings to the fire twice daily, for securing the welfare of both the child and the mother. Thus have been described the protective measures.
48-(1). Finding the new mother hungry, she should, if endowed with a strong constitution, be made to drink unctuous beverages consisting of ghee or til oil, flesh-marrow or bone-marrow, whichever is found to be suitable, mixed with the powder of long pepper, roots of long pepper, piper chaba, white flowered leadwort and ginger. After she has drunk the oily potion, her abdomen should be anointed with ghee and til oil and wrapped round tightly with a large piece of white cloth; thereby the Vata in her stomach will not be able to produce disorders, being given no room.
48. After the oily potion has been digested, she should be made to drink medicated gruel with long pepper etc., mentioned above and well seasoned with unctuous substances and also rendered thin, according to the prescribed dose. At both the times, i. e. immediately before drinking the oily potion and the gruel, she should be sprinkled over with warm water. Having observed this regimen for five or seven nights, the mother should be gradually nourished. Thus far has been described the regimen of the lying-in woman in health.
49. The disorders arising in a lying-in woman are either difficult or impossible of cure. Since her entire humoral economy has been depleted and broken up by the demand made on it for the growth of the fetus and since the body is drained of vitality by the delivery throes and by the loss of fluids and of blood, she should therefore be tended in the prescribed manner; and particular care should be taken to treat her with inunction, massage, shower-bath, immersion bath and dietary modes
which have been medicated with articles of magical, life-promoting, roborant, sweet and Vata-destroying properties. For, women who have recently delivered, become exceedingly empty in body.
The Ceremony of Naming the Boy
50-(1). On the tenth day the woman, together with the child, should bathe in water treated with all fragrant herbs and with white rape-seed and lodh; she should put on light, new and clean garments; deck herself with pure, coveted, light and variegated ornaments; touch auspicious objects and worship the appropriate deity; receive the blessings of Brahmanas with unshorn locks, white garments and whole bodies; then having wrapped the child who should be placed with his head either towards the east or the north in folds of a new garment and declaring that it (the child) salutes the twice-born headed by the gods, the father of the child should give it two names: one name denoting the constellation under which it was born and the other of intended meaning.
50. Of these, the meaningful name should have a sonant for its first letter and for its last a semi-vowel or ushman [ūṣman] (sibilants and aspirate), should be free of diphthongs, reminiscent of the three ancestors (father, grand-father and great grandfather) and not new-fangled. The ‘stellar’ name shall be identical with that of the stellar deity and should be either di-syllabic or tetra-syllabic.
Signs of long-lived children
51-(1). The naming over, the infant should be examined with a view to learning the probable length of his life. Now the following are the signs of children that are going to be long-lived.
51. Thus, they commend hair of the head that grows singly in separate follicles, is soft, sparse, oily, firmly rooted, and black; skin that is taut and thick-layered; head that is normal, endowed more than usually with the traits of excellence, a little in excess of the normal measurements, proportionate and resembling an umbrella in shape; fore-head that is broad, firm, even, well knit in the skull, joints showing vertical lines, plump, wrinkled and shaped like the half-moon, ears that are plump, broad and even in the lobes, well-matched, pendulous, depressed in the back, well-jointed in the concha and large-holed; eye-brows that are slightly drooping at the ends, not joined together, well-matched, thick-set and large; eyes that, are well-matched, straight-seeing, well-defined in all parts, strong, endowed with lustre, beautiful in themselves, and in their corners; nose that is straight, capable of deep-breathing, well-bridged and slightly curved in the tip (aquiline); mouth that is large, straight and provided with well-set teeth; tongue that is long, wide, smooth, slender and of a healthy color; palate that is smooth, moderately fleshy, warm and red; voice that is mighty, not plaintive, endearing; resonant, deep-toned and inspiriting; lips that are neither too thick nor too thin, well extended so as to screen the mouth and red jaws that are large; neck that is rounded and not overlarge; chest that is wide and plump; the collar-bone and the spine that are inconspicuous; breasts that are wide-spaced; sides that taper down aud are firm; arms, thighs and fingers that are rounded, full and extended; hands and feet that are large and plump; nails that are firm, rounded, oily, pink, convex and shaped like a tortoise; navel that has a right whirl and is well depressed; waist that is two-thirds of the chest in circumference, straight and evenly fleshy; buttocks that are rounded, compact, plump, neither very elevated nor very depressed; thighs that taper down gradually and are plump; shanks that are neither too fleshy nor void of flesh in the ankles like those of the deer and have veins, bones and joints well-covered; ankles that are neither very fleshy nor void of flesh; feet of the description given earlier and tortoise-shaped; and flatus, urine, stools, and anus as also sleep, waking, movements, crowing, crying and sucking that conform to the norm; whatever else has been left unmentioned. here, if conforming to what is excellent in nature, should be regarded as desirable; what is contrary to this is to be considered undesirable. Thus have been described the signs of longevity.
The Wet-nurse etc.
52. We shall now teach how to carry out the examination of the wet-nurse. The physician should say thus:—‘Bring a wet-nurse who belongs to the same caste as the infant’s mother, who is in her youth, submissive, free from disease, not deficient iu any limb, not given to unwhole some pursuits, not ugly, not ill-disposed, native of the country, not mean-minded, not given to mean acts, wellborn, affectionate towards children, free from any disease, whose children have not died, who is a mother of male children, who has plenty of milk, who is never heedless, not given to sleeping in beds soiled with excrement, not given to low company, skilful in attendance, clean, averse to unclean ways and endowed with the excellence of breasts and milk.
53. Concerning the excellence of breasts:—They should be neither very high nor very loose hanging, neither very lean nor very plump, and they should have proportionate teats and be easy to suck. This is the excellence of breasts.
54. Concerning the excellence of milk:—It should have natural color, smell, taste and touch and when poured into a pot of water, it should mix at once and perfectly with the water, being of a natural kind. Such milk is both strengthening and health-giving. This is the excellence of milk
55. Milk not conforming to the above description is to be known as vitiated. It is classified thus:—Milk that is of darkish or reddish color, astringent in after-taste, clear, of no marked smell, dry, watery, frothy, light, not satisfying, inducing leanness and generative of the disorders of Vata, should be known as being tainted by Vata. Milk that looks black:sh, bluish, yellow, or coppery, has an after-taste which is sour or pungent, which smells like a corpse or like blood, which is very warm and generative of the disorders of Pitta, should be known as being tainted by Pitta. Milk that is very white, very sweet with a saltish aftertaste, that exhiles the smell of ghee, oil, flesh-marrow or bone-marrow, that is viscid, fibrous and sinks in water without mixing and is generative of the disorders of Kapha, Should be known as tainted by Kapha.
56-(1). Following a specific analysis of the faults of these three types of vitiated milk, emetics, purgatives and oily and dry enemata, if administered systematically with relation to the particular disorder, will serve to rectify the faults, As regards he dietetic rule with reference to a woman whose milk has become vitiated, it is as follows:—Her food and drink should consist mainly of barley, wheat, Sali rice, Shashtika rice, green gram, pulse, peas, horse gram, Sura, Sauviraka, Maireya, aud Med aka wines, garlic and Indian beech. The milk should be examined at frequent intervals for specific faults and the appropriate correctives administered.
56. The infusions of Patha, dry ginger, deodar, nut-grass, trilobed virgin’s bower, guduch, fruits aud seeds of kurchi, chiretta, kurroa and Indian sarsaparilla are said to be generally beneficial. Similarly, the administration of other ingredients that are bitter, astringent pungent and sweet should be given, taking into consideration the particular fault of the milk as also the dosage and season. Thus have been described the corrective measures in galactic disorders.
57. The following are promotives of lactation:—All wines with the exception of Sidhu, vegetables, cereals and meal which come, under the heads of domestic, wet-land, and aquatic; foodstuffs that abound in sweet, sour or salt liquids; herbs containing milky juices: the regular drinking of cow’s milk; avoidance of laborious tasks; and. the drinking of the infusions of cuscus grass, Shashtika and Shali rice, Ikshuvalika [ikṣuvālikā], sacrificial grass, small sacrificial grass, thatch grass, elephant grass aud roots of prickly sesban. Such are the lactiferous agents.
58. When, in this manner the wet-nurse has become endowed with sweet, copious and pure milk, then having bathed and arointed herself with unguents, put on white garments and wearing any one of the following drugs, Aindri [aindrī], Brahmi [brāhmī], Shatavirya [śatavīryā], Sahasravirya [sahasravīryā], emblic myrobalan, guduch, chebulic myrobalan, kurroa, evening mallow and perfumed cherry, she should, seating herself with her face towards the east, suckle the child with her right breast. Thus have been described the duties of a wet nurse.
59. We shall now describe the procedure with regard to the construction of the nursery. A skilful architect should build and furnish the nursery. It should be excellent, beautiful, well-lighted, sheltered from draught, admitting of air from only one direction, strong, free from such pests as marauding beasts, animals; fanged creatures, mice and moths; well-planned as regards the places of water-storage, grinding, lavatory, bath and cooking; comfortable during all seasons, and provided with beds, seats and spreads suited to each season Moreover the rites connected with protecting the house from, the influence of evil spirits as also those with propitiatory, auspicious, sacrificial and penitential offerings should be performed and the house should be filled with clean and experienced physicians and with those attached to the family. Thus has been described the procedure with regard to the construction of the nursery.
60. The bed, seats, spreads and covers meant for the child should be soft, light, clean and fragrant. Sweat-stained, soiled and germ-laden articles should at once be removed; so also those that are soiled with feces or urine. If fresh ones are not available the same may be used again after they have been washed well and fumigated well and rendered perfectly clean and dry.
61.For fumigating the garments as also the beds, spreads and covers, the following articles, smeared with ghee may be used:—barley, rapeseed, linseed, asafoetida, gum-guggul, sweet flag, angelica, Brahmi [brāhmī], corydalis, nardus, Palankasha [palaṅkaṣā], Ashoka [aśoka], kurroa and the sloughs of snakes.
62. The following articles should be worn as talismans by the child:—Gems, tips of the right horns of a live rhinoceros, deer, gayal or bull; herbs like the Aindri [aindrī] etc., the herbs Jivaka [jīvaka] and Rishabhaka [ṛṣabhaka], as also all such articles as the Brahmanas learned in the Atharvaveda may recommend.
Toys
63. The toys of the child should be variegated, sound-producing, attractive, light, without sharp edges, incapable of being swallowed, fraught with no danger to life and unfrightening
64. It is never good to frighten the child. Accordingly, if he is found weeping, refusing to eat his meals, or in any other way proving recalcitrant, it is not right to take the name of goblin, ghost or harpy with a view to frightening him into obedience.
Treatment of Diseases
65-(1). If some disorder overtakes the child, the physician should rightly understand the child from the viewpoints of habitus, etiological factors, premonitory symptoms, signs and symptoms and homologatory signs and constantly keeping in view all the factors concerned in the tetrad of patient, medicine, time and place, should proceed to treat him by medication that is sweet, soft, light, sweet-smelling, cold and pleasant.
65. Such measures prove homologous to children. It is thus only that they can achieve lasting well-being. As regards the child in health, the regimen to be followed is that relating to hygienic living which consists of recourse to factors which are opposite in quality to those of the place, time and bodily constitution and the giving up of all unwholesome things by a gradual change over to the use of non-homologatory factors. Thus the child attains the plenitude of strength, healthy complexion, bodily growth and longevity.
66. In this manner, the child should be reared through boyhood to youth till he has acquired sound knowledge, both religious and secular.
67. Thus have been described the measures promotive of the fulfilment of the desire for children. By recourse to these measures in the manner laid down, one who is free from envy, attains regard and honour according to his desire.
Summary
Here are the two recapitulatory verses:—
68. By following the precepts laid down here which are full of high import, and ensure the fulfilment of the desire for offspring, the wise man, free from envy, secures for himself regard and honour according to his desire.
69. The Section on the Human Embodiment is so called because it treats of the embodiment in all its aspects, both those relating to the divine and those which are purely human in man
8. Thus, in the Section on Human Embodiment in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the eighth chapter entitled “The Continuation of one’s Lineage [i.e., jātisūtrīya—jatisutriya/jati-sutra]” is completed.
The two kinds of tests
4. Among the various things thus requiring to be taken note of, there are some which do not pertain to the patient’s body. Those which do not pertain to the patient’s body are to be studied in the light of authoritative instruction concerning such matters and inference. Those which pertain to his body are to be judged from both the view-points of the normal condition and the morbid condition of the human body.
The normal and the abnormal traits
5 Now, the normal condition is determined by heredity, family, clime, season, age and idiosyncrasy. It is the sum of these hereditary, family, climatic, seasonal, periodic and idiosyncratic tendencies that makes the individual variation among persons.
6. As regards the morbid condition, it falls under three heads: (1) the morbid condition referable to congenital body-mark, (2) the morbid condition referable to etiological factors, (3) the morbid condition referable to factors which appear to behave as etiological factors.
7-(1). The morbid condition referable to. congenital body marks is that whose causative factors are predetermined by destiny in the form of physiognomic signs. Some of these signs may be latent in the body, and emerging into view at particular times in particular regions of the body, give rise to particular morbid conditions.
7-(2). The morbid condition referable to etiological factors is that whose causation is seen as laid down in the chapters on pathology.
7. The morbid condition referable to factors which appear to behave like the etiological factors, is that which resembles the condition brought about by etiological factors. It is this undetermined condition of morbidity which the physicians regard as the determination in the ascertainment of the remaining life-span. It is, moreover, this morbid condition resulting from the exhaustion of the life-measure and recalling a corpselike appearance that the wise delineate for the purpose of ascertaining the remaining portion of the life-span. It is with reference to this condition that we shall get out the signs and symptoms observed-in the body of the patient who is fated to die. This is the gist of the subject. We shall explain this at greater length
8. At the very outset, we shall consider the subject of skin-color. It is thus: Black, dark, darkish-white, and bright-white are the normal shades of skin-color. As regards other shades of skin color the student should know them by close observation, such shades being represented by the specialists concerned by words of illustrative import or otherwise.
9. Blue, dark-brown, coppery, green and pale white are the pathological discoloration of the body. As regards the other pathological discoloration or the formations of a fresh one, the student should learn to know them by close observation. Thus have been explained the normal and the abnormal colorations of the body.
10. If the normal coloration is seen on one half of the body and abnormal coloration on the other half, the two colors being set off by a line of demarcation, whether such demarcation is into left and right, fore and back, upper and lower, or external and internal, it should be known as constituting an unfavorable prognostic sign. In the same manner, if this demarcation of color is observed in the face or other parts of the body, it is prognostic of death.
11. The foregoing remarks concerning disparity in skin-color apply with equal force to condition of disparity represented by depression and animation or by unctuousness and dryness.
12. Similarly, the emergence of port-wine marks, freckles, moles, pimples and similar other eruptions is to be regarded as constituting unfavorable prognosis.
13. Similarly the appearance of any of the abnormal discolorations described in nails, eyes, face, urine, feces, hands, feet or lips etc., in a patient who has already suffered loss of strength, complexion [varna] and sense-power, is significant of the diminished life-span
Fatal prognostic discolorations and voice-changes
14. If any other discoloration that is undefined and unprecedented is seen in the continually sinking patient, then that too, is to be recognised as unfavorable prognosis. Thus we have described the subject of coloration.
15-(1). As regards the subject of voice, the voices resembling those of the swan, the crane, the felly of a wheel, kettle-drum, Kalavinka crow, pigeon and Jarjara (a kind of musical instrument), are the normal voice modes of man. As regards other pathological changes in voice, they should be determined by close observation to such shades being represented by the specialists by words of illustrative import or otherwise.
15. The pathological conditions of speech that are like the bleating of a sheep, or low voiced, choked, indistinct, quivering, painful and like stammer are considered to be abnormal varieties of speech. As regards other pathological conditions of speech such as the recurrence of an original abnormality or the development of a fresh one, the student should learn to know by close observation. Such are the normal and abnormal varieties of speech.
16. Now if the pathological conditions of voice arise abruptly or change from one to another or from one to many, then they are inauspicious. Thus ends the subject of voice.
17. The subjects of complexion and voice [varna-svara] have been thus described fully for the sake of the knowledge of the signs of fatal prognosis.
Here are verses again—
18.If abnormal discoloration occurs either in half or in the entire body without any reason, the patient will not survive.
19. If a patient’s face has acquired on one half one and on another half another of the following colors namely blue, dark-brown, coppery and tawny, that is a sign of unfavourable prognosis.
20. If half of the face is unctuous and the other half dry, half the face depressed and the other half animated, it is a sign of approaching death.
21 If moles, port-wine marks, freckles, and network of vessels of various kinds suddenly appear in the face of the patient, he is destined to die
22. Flower-like marks on the nails and the teeth, tartar on the teeth or powdery stuff on the teeth—these, are the symptoms of approaching death.
23, The discoloration of lips, feet, hands, eyes urine and feces, and also of the nails in a weakened patient is a symptom of the approaching end.
24. The wise man must recognise that the man, both of whose lips are dark-blue like ripe jambul fruit, has come to the end of his life and is about to die
25. The sinking man in whom one or more of the pathological conditions of speech have suddenly appeared is sure to die.
26 Whatever other pathological conditions of complexion and voice [varna-svara] are seen in a patient, wasted of strength and flesh—all of them, denote the dawn of death.
Summary
Here is the recapitulatory verse—
27. Thus have been declared the signs and symptoms of fatal prognosis in the subject of complexion and voice [varna-svara]. He, who knows these thoroughly, well will not be confused in the art of prognosis
1. Thus, in the Section on Sensorial Prognosis in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the first chapter entitled “The Sensorial prognosis by indications of Complexion and Voice [i.e., varṇasvara—varna-svara]” is completed.
Fatal prognostic odors
7. This chapter on the blossoming of fatal symptoms of various kinds in various men is expounded in order to impart the right knowledge of prognosis by means of the fatal symptoms manifesting before death.
8-9. That man is regarded by the wise as manifesting fatal symptoms, who exudes, day and night, smells resembling those of various flowers in a forest abounding in various trees and creepers, bursting into bloom. Such a man is certain to die before a year.
10 Similarly, that man is said to show fatal symptoms who exudes a smell resembling that of any flower, be it pleasant or unpleasant.
11. A man whose body exudes a mixture of unpleasant smells, or a single unpleasant smell, is to be regarded by the physician, as one showing fatal prognostic symptoms
12 He whose body exudes unpleasant smell after smearing himself with fragrant articles, or fragrant smell when he is not thus smeared, in an abnormal manner without any recognisable cause, is to be regarded as showing fatal prognost;c symptoms.
13. These are:—sandal, costus, Indian valerian, eagle-wood, honey and flower-garland, feces and urine, dead and putrified smells.
14. And many other odors derived from various sources should be recognised by the use of discretion, in their abnormal or unnatural conditons.
15. This we explain, in order to cover the entire field of the symptoms of smells, knowing which the physician should recognise the fatal prognosis.
16. The man, whose body exudes a pleasant or unpleasant smell constantly without any recognisable cause, dies before a year. This much about the science of prognosis with reference to smell
Fatal prognostic tastes
17. Henceforth, the science of prognosis with reference to the body-taste of patients is systematically expounded.
18. That taste which is natural to men in their healthy condition undergoes two binds of morbid change at the time of death.
19. In some it changes into a morbid taste in the mouth at death, while in others it changes into an extremely sweet taste.
20. Such a change has to be recognised only by inference. For, how can a man ascertain the taste of another’s body or his mouth?
21. Flies, lice, wasps and mosquitoes get repelled and turn away from the bad taste of the body of the man about to die.
22 While the bees etc., hover over a man about to die, who is full of a sweet taste though he may have bathed and smeared himself with sandal paste.
Summary
Here is the recapitulatory verse—
23. The symptoms of taste and smell have been described by me, in general, with reference to the person in whom fatal prognostic symptoms have blossomed. The result of these must be judged to be death
2. Thus, in the Section on Sensorial Prognosis in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the second chapter entitled
“The Sensorial [i.e., indriya] prognosis from the Blossoming of Symptoms [i.e., pushpitaka]” is completed.
The Method of investigation
4-(1). The physician desirous of ascertaining, by the method of palpation, the measure of life left to the patient, should palpate the latter’s entire body with his hand which must be in a normal condition. If it is not so, he should get the palpation done by some one else.
4-(2). While feeliog the patient’s body, the following are the abnormalities to be noted.
4 They are—the absence of throbbing in those members of the body which are always throbbing; coldness of those parts which are always warm; rigidity of those parts which are always soft; roughness in those parts which are always smooth; the disappearance of those parts which should normally exist; the looseness, sagging or dislocation of joints; the paucity of flesh or blood; hardness; excessive perspiration and rigidity, also whatever else that is abnormal and unaccountable. Thus we have declared in brief, the unfavourable prognostic signs observed by palpation.
5-(1). The same, we shall now expound in extesno. Thus, if the patient on being felt with the hand separately on the feet, calves, thighs, buttocks, belly, sides backbone, hands, neck, palate, lips and forehead, is seen to perspire or to be cold or rigid or hard or bereft of flesh and blood, then the physician should conclude that the man is fey and will die in no distant future.
5. If, again, on being felt, each separately, the ankles, knees, groin, anus, testes, phallus, navel, shoulders, breasts, wrists, ribs, jaws, nose, ears, eyes, eye-brows, temples etc., are seen to be loose, out of position, displaced or sagging, then the physician should know that, that man is fey and will die in no distant future.
6-(1) Similarly, the physician should examine the patient’s respiration, the two sides of the neck, the teeth; the eye-lashes, the eyes, the hair of the head, the hair on other parts of the body, the stomach, the nails, and the fingers.
6. If the patient's respirations are either too long or too short, it is to be concluded that he is nigh unto death. If the two sides of the neck, on being felt, are observed not to pulsate, it is to be concluded that he is nigh unto death. If the patient’s teeth are coated all over with tartar, are abnormally white or covered with sugar-like particles, it is to be concluded that he is nigh unto death. If the patient’s eye-lashes are clotted, it is to be known that he is nigh unto death. If the patient’s eyes are not normal but evince abnormal tendencies that is to say if they are too protuberant, too sunken, too oblique, too asymmetrical, too watery, either perpetually open, perpetually closed, or excessively winking, restlessly wandering, with abnormal visions, with deficient vision, have lost their keenness of vision or are wanting in perspective, are color-blind, either too white or too black, or are red like hot embers, or if the vision is suffused over-much with an unhealthy tinge of any one of the colors—black, yellow, blue, dark-brown, coppery, green, turmeric, yellow and white, then it should be concluded that the patient is at death’s door. Thereafter, let the physician take hold of a few hairs of the head or of the body and tug at them. If being thus pulled, they come out with the roots without causing pain, then it is to be known that the patient is soon to depart from life. If the veins in the abdominal region become conspicuous or if they appear dark brown, coppery, blue, yellow or whitish, it is to be understood that the patient is not going to survive. If the nails are drained of blood, and the flesh has receded from them and they look dark blue resembling the color of ripe fruits of the jambul tree, it is to be gathered that the patient’s days are numbered. Lastly, the physician should test the fingers of the patient. If, when jerked, they do not crack, it should be known that it is all over with the patient.
Summary
Here is the recapitulatory verse
7. The physician, who by palpation ascertains these various palpable signs, will never be confounded in the matter of prognostic knowledge of the life-span of a patient.
3. Thus, in the Section on Sensorial Prognosis in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the third chapter entitled “The Sensorial [indriya] prognosis through examination by Palpation [parimarshana]” is completed.
Means of examining the senses
3. Learn how the specialist who desires to ascertain the life-span, should examine all sense-faculties [i.e., indriya] of the patient.
4. The senses of sight etc., are to be tested as regards their soundness, by means of inference; for it is only by inference that we have a knowledge of the sense-faculties [i.e., indriya] which are ultra sensual.
5. When you find that a patient’s sense-experiences are aberrant from normality without any accountable cause, they are to be recognised as symptoms of approaching death.
6. The signs occurring in the sensefaculties indicative of unfavourable prognosis have been thus stated correctly. Now, again, listen to an elaborate account of the same.
Fatal sensorial prognosis
7. If a man sees space as if it were solid like the earth and the earth as if it were an emptiness like space, seeing either of these incongruous sights, he dies quickly
8. If a person is able to visualize the invisible wind in the sky or is unable to see the blazing fire, he should be known to have his days numbered
9 One who sees clear crystalline waters which are either standing or moving, as if they are covered, over with a net where there is no such net, will soon depart from life.
10. He who perceives, while waking, the shades and various kinds of demons or other strange things, cannot survive long.
11. One who sees a normally blazing fire either as being blue, lustreless, black or white, dies after the seventh night.
12. He who perceives the light of clouds when there are no clouds or perceives clouds when there are none in the sky, or perceives lightning without clouds, dies quickly.
13. He who perceives the clear (unclouded) sun or moon as it were an earthen pot covered with a black cloth, does not survive long.
14. If a person, whether diseased or healthy, sees the sun and the moon eclipsed, when it is not the time for an eclipse, his life ends with the ending of the illusion.
15. If a person sees the sun by night and the (shining) moon by day, and smoke arising without fire, or fire void of brilliance at night, he is destined to die.
16. Those that are about to die perceive dull and lustreless things as bright and shining, and bright things as dull, and all things in their contrary characteristics
17. Those whose lives are coming to their end see abnormal shapes, abnormal colors, abnormal assemblage of members, without any rhyme or reason.
18. One who sees invisible things and one who fails to see perfectly visible things, both these, are sure to proceed quickly to the abode of death.
19. He who hears voices where none exist (acousma) and he who does not hear what is said to him (acousmatagnosis), both of them, are to be regarded as already dead by the wise man.
20 If an ailing man, closing his ears with the fingers does not hear the internal (jvālā) sound as of a burning fire, him should the wise man give up as one from whom life has fled.
21. He who perceives odors in the contrary manner, knowing good as bad and vice versa, or does not perceive any odor at all, is to be regarded as one whom life has left.
22. He who does not perceive the tastes at all or fails to perceive their true nature, in the absence of any disease of the mouth, is to be regarded by the wise as ripe for death.
23 He who feels hot things to be cold, rough things to be smooth and soft things to be hard, or, having touched things feels them to be other than what they are, is to be regarded as approaching his death.
24. If a man perceives subtle things that transcend the ordinary senses, without having practised either severe austerity or a systematic course of yoga, he soon gives up the ghost.
25. He who perceives the objects of sense-experience without his senses [i.e., indriya] coming into actual contact with them and whose perceptions are like in one whose senses are not vitiated by morbidity, does not survive long.
26. Those, who being in normal health perceive the sense objects in distorted and unreal manner repeatedly, owing to the impairment of their understanding, are to be regarded as approaching their end.
Summary
Here is the recapitulatory verse—
27. The physician who perceives these foreboding symptoms of the sense-faculties in their right nature knows the death or survival of a patient.
4. Thus, in the Section on Sensorial Prognosis in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the fourth chapter entitled “The Sensorial prognosis through examination of the functions of all the senses [i.e., indriya]” is completed.
Fatal prognosis of consumption
6. We shall now declare some of the most serious premonitory symptoms [purvarupa] which are followed by diseases which in turn, are followed by death.
7. Consumption in a person whose strength is waning, whose catarrhal condition is aggravated and who passionately is addicted to women, will hasten him to his death.
8. The person that in his dreams travels south mounted on dogs, camels, or asses, will depart from life soon, being afflicted with consumption.
Fatal prognosis of Fever
9. He who drinks in his dreams, intoxicating drinks in the company of shades or is dragged by dogs, dies getting an attack of the most severe type of fever.
Fatal prognosis of hemothermia
10. He who sees the sky near at hand like a lac-colored cloth, will suffer from hemothermia and die.
11. He who finds himself in his dreams wearing red garlands and his whole body tinted red and clad in red garments, and while in a fit of laughter, finds himself being dragged by a woman, dies afflicted with hemothermia.
Fatal Prognosis of Gulma
12.Colicky pain, meteorism and intestinal gurgling, excessive debility and discoloration of the nails—these are the premonitory symptoms [purvarupa] of Gulma that terminates fatally.
13. He, in whose dreams a vicious thorny creeper is seen to spring from his cardiac region, dies affected by a severe type of Gulma which ends fatally.
Fatal prognosis of Dermatosis
14. The man, on whose body even a small bruise breaks open into a big, wound and in whose body cuts and scratches do not heal, him does death overtake preceded by dermatosis.
15. He who sees himself in his dreams naked and besmeared over with ghee and pouring libation on a flame-less fire, or who dreams of lotuses growing from his chest, dies affected with dermatosis.
Fatal prognosis of Urinary anomalies
16. He, on whose body flies swarm though he has bathed and painted his limbs with fragrant substances, will be affected with urinary disorders and will perish of that very disease.
17. He, who in his dreams drinks various kinds of unctuous preparations in the company of Candalas (the untouchable class of people) will be affected with urinary disorders which will lead to his end.
Fatal prognosis of insanity
18. Reverie, weariness, inopportune excitement and delusion, indifference to things and loss of strength—these are the premonitory symptoms [purvarupa] of insanity which is to end fatally.
19. Seeing a man who has detestation for food, who has lost his wits and is affected with urticaria, the wise physician should know him as destined to die by a violent attack of insanity.
20. The man who suffers from extreme irritability, great terror or sudden
smiles, and who often faints and feels great thirst, him docs insanity seize and destroy.
2L He who dancing in his dreams with crowds of demons, gets drowned in water, will be affected with violent insanity and die.
Fatal prognosis of Epilepsy
22. The man, who, when fully awake, perceives darkness which does not exist, and hears many and varied noises that are non-existent, dies afflicted with epilepsy.
23. The man, who dreams, that while he is intoxicated with drink and dancing, a shade turns him topsyturvy and carries him away, him does death carry away afflicting with epilepsy.
Fatal prognosis of Convulsions
24. If a man’s jaws, sides of the neck and eyes get stiffened on awaking, him does tetanus seize and kill without doubt.
Fatal prognosis of Vomiting
25. The man who in his dreams eats sweet coils or sweet cakes and on waking vomits the stuff, does not survive.
26. He, who is well conversant with these premonitory symptoms [purvarupa], can forecast the consequent disease and its prognosis
Fatal prognosis of Dreams
27. These and other such ominous dreams are to be taken note of as foreboding death to ailing men and great distress to the unailing
28. The man on whose head, in dreams grow bamboo and other shrubs, creepers and other similar herbage and in whose hair birds hide, or who has his bead clean shaven,
29. or the man that is surrounded in dreams by vultures, owls, dogs, crows and such other birds or by demons, shades, ghosts, women, untouchables, Dravidas and Andhrakas,
30. or the man that is caught in the meshes of bamboo, wild grass, creeper-meshes, ropes, grass or thorns, or the man, that in dreams while walking, falls down,
31. or he who in dreams falls on the ground or on a heap of dust or on an ant-hill or into ash or on a cremation ground or on a mound or into a pit,
32. or the man that, in dreams, dips in dirty waters, slush, or in a dark well, or is carried away by a swift-flowing stream,
33. or the man, that in dreams, drinks unctuous substances or inuncts himself or vomits or purges, finds gold, quarrels or is bound or defeated,
34.or the man, that in dreams, loses his pair of sandals or the skin of whose feet falls off or who feels delight or sees his ancestor in an enraged mood threatening him,
35. or the man, who sees in his dreams, the falling either of his teeth, or of the sun or the moon, stars, gods, lamps, or his eyes, or their destruction or the breaking of a mountain,
36. or the man, who dreams of entering into a forest of red flowers, or the earth or a place of sin, or the funeral pyre or a cave full of awful darkness,
37. or the man, who in his dreams, goes towards the south wearing garlands of red flowers laughing loud and naked, or goes into a fearful forest in a carriage driven by a monkey,
38. or the man who sees, in his dream, people wearing brown clothes or cruel-looking men, naked men or those carrying staves, black men or men with blood shot eyes, all of which are undesirable sights,
39 or the min, that sees, in his dreams, a woman who is black, sinful and unclean, with long hair, nails, and breasts, wearing very red garlands and clothes and who is like the very night of destruction;
40. the man who perceives such fearful dreams, if he be ailing, will die. If he is in good health he will be afflicted with such diseases as from which only a few can escape.
41. As the channels of the mind are filled with the highly vitiated triad of humors, when the fatal time approaches, the man sees these fearful dreams.
42. When the man is not in profound sleep, he perceives with the mind which is the lord of senses, many kinds of dreams, of which some become fruitful and some not.
Seven kinds of Dreams
43. Dreams are known to be of seven kinds:—those pertaining to things that are seen, heard, experienced, pictured from inner desires, created by the fancy and things that presage the coming good or evil, and lastly dreams that are born of morbid humors.
44 The wise physician should regard the first five of them as fruitless as also those born of day-sleep, and those that are either too short or too long
45. The dream that is dreamt in the first part of the night has only a small degree of fulfilment. But having dreamt, if a man does not sleep again, it gets immediately fulfilled with great consequences.
46. But if a man, having seen in his dream inauspicious things, sees in it again good and auspicious things, its fruits are to be regarded as good.
Summary
Here is the recapitulatory verse—
47. The physician who knows these premonitory symptoms and the science of oneiordlogy, specially with reference to grave dreams, will never begin treatment of an incurable case by mistake.
5. Thus, in the Section on Sensorial Prognosis in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the fifth chapter entitled “The Sensorial (indriya) Prognosis by the examination of Premonitory Symptoms (purvarupa)” is completed.
Incurable types
3.“O, great sage! who are the ailing persons that a physician should not undertake to treat, seeing that no treatment is of any avail in such cases?”
4. On being asked this most difficult of questions by Agnivesha, [?] what the worshipful Atreya declared to him, the same do you hear.
5-6. That man who feels great pain in the upper region of his chest while speaking, who vomits the food eaten and whose ingested food is not digested even if retained, whose strength wanes quickly, in whom thirst increases excessively and in whose cardiac region pain is born him should the physician avoid.
7. If a patient, who is affected with a deep hiccup, develops diarrhea with hemorrhage, him should the physician not treat, remembering the directions of Atreya
8. If a debilitated patient develops abdominal distension and diarrhea, his life is difficult to saye [say?].
9. If constipation and excessive thirst make their entry into an already weakened man, life deserts him ere long.
10. If dry severe cough affects the man who suffers from fever in the forenoon and is devoid of strength and flesh, he is to be regarded as verily dead.
11. If a patient with abdominal disease and subnormal temperature, who passes condensed urine and hardened stools, develops dyspnea, he does not survive.
12. The patient, whose abdominal edema spreads to his feet and hands, causes great anguish to his relations and dies of the same disorder.
13. If the man has edema in the feet and his calves are flaccid and there is pain in both the shanks, the physician should avoid him.
14. If the man of poor complexion, vitality and digestive power, develops swelling in the hands, feet, genitals and the abdomen, he should not be given treatment.
15 One who constantly expectorates from his chest copious quantities of phlegm which is tinged blue or yellow or with blood, should be avoided even from a distance
16. The emaciated man who develops horripilation and thickened urine, and who is afflicted with cough and fever, should be avoided from afar by the wise physician.
17. If, in an extremely emaciated and weakened man, there arises tridiscordance of humors of a formidable character, there is no treatment for him.
18. If, in an extremely debilitated patient, there occur fever and diarrhea as sequela of edema or edema as sequela of these two, he comes to his end soon.
19. If an extremely emaciated man suffering from anemia develops excessive thirst, rigidity of sight and heightened respiration, he must not be treated by the wise physician.
20. The man whose jaws and sides of neck have become rigid, who is greatly afflicted with thirst and debility, and in whom the vital breaths are active only in the chest, should be avoided.
21. If the man, whose flesh, strength and digestive fire have ebbed low, faints and jerks his limbs about and finds no comfort whatever, he is going to die before long.
22. The patient, in whom serious diseases arising from mutually conflicting etiological factors and requiring antagonistic lines of treatment grow up suddenly, succumbs to them very quickly.
23. The man whose strength, intelligence, health, assimilation, flesh and
blood deteriorate suddenly, passes away very soon.
24.The man whose health ebbs away suddenly and whose natural dispositions deteriorate suddenly, him does death seize and carry away quickly.
Summary
Here is the recapitulatory verse—
25 Thus, these are the diseased persons that are to be avoided; the wise never see any success of treatment in such cases.
6. Thus in the Section on Sensorial Prognosis, in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the sixth chapter entitled “The Sensorial prognosis with reference to Certain types of Patients” is completed.
Fatal prognostic type of Body-lustre
4.He, whose shadow cast by the moon-light, sun-light or lamp-light or seen iu the water or the mirror, appears distorted in the limbs is indeed a dead man.
5-6. Shadows which are broken or torn or wavering or truncated or overgrown or invisible or attenuated, or cut into two, or deformed or beheaded, these and such other shadows or reflections of the human body are to be known as portentous of death, if they are not the remit of etiological factors.
7. If a man’s reflection (or aura) is discrepant with regard to shape, proportions, color or lustre, he is as good as dead though he be in sound health.
8.The body-form is known as the shape. It is symmetrical or asymmetrical; the size is stated to be of three kinds—medium, short and tall.
9 The shadow which is seen in the water or mirror or against the sun, and which is the exact replica of the original, is the reflected shadow. The other shadow (the aura) is dependent on the body’s color and radiance
The lustre and Aura pertaining to each Proto element
10. These auras pertaining to the five proto-elements of ether and the rest are of corresponding distinctive characteristics. That which pertains to other is pure, blue, glossy and lustrous
11. That which pertains to air is dry, darkish brown and red, and devoid of lustre. The one pertaining to fire is clear red, fiery and delightful to the eye
12. The one pertaining to water is considered to be clear like pure lapis lazuli and very glossy. The one pertaining to earth is stable, glossy, dense, smooth, dark and white.
13. Of these, the one pertaining to air is inauspicious The other four betoken happiness, but the one of air is portentous of death or great suffering.
14-15. The body-lustre originates from the proto-element, fire. It is stated to be of seven varieties, viz., red, yellow, white, dark-brown, green, pale-white and black. Of them, those that are expansive, glossy and broad are auspicious, while those that are dy, soiled and contracted, are inauspicious.
16.The aura overshadows the body-color; whereas the lustre enhances the body-color. The aura is only sensed from close quarters, while the body-lustre shines from afar.
17. There is no man without the aura and the lustre. The distinctive traits connected with these two, aura and lustre, however, reveal themselves only at the destined time, presaging good or evil.
Syptoms of Impending death
18. The man whose eyes are jaundiced, whose face is swollen, whose temples are devoid of flesh, who is in a terrified condition, and whose body is hot, such a man, should be avoided.
19. The boastful patient who faints every time that he is raised in his bed, will not survive even for a week.
20. The man whose diseases are born of the discordance of two humors and spread in opposite directions i.e. in the upper and the lower regions of the body, and whose assimilative system is deranged, does not generally survive longer than half a mouth.
21. If a man, afflicted with disease, is emaciated, eats very little, but excretes large quantities of urine and feces, the physician should avoid him.
22. If a weak patient eats a greater quantity of food than he used to do and discharges very little urine and feces, he must be regarded as good as a dead man.
23. The man, that eats delicious and most nutritive food but continually deteriorates in strength and complexion, does not survive.
24. The weak man that groans, is short of breath, has loose motions and is afflicted with thirst and parching of the mouth, does not survive.
25. The man that is short of breath and makes all sorts of bodily contortions, him has Atreya Punarvasu declared to be indeed a dead man.
26. If the man of poor complexion, strength and digestive fire, develops inspiratory dyspnea and is overwhelmed with phlegm, he does not survive.
27. If the weak man develops a rigid upward look in his eyes, and his sides of the neck are constantly moving and he is afflicted with great thirst and dryness of the mouth, he does not survive.
28.The man whose cheeks are swollen and who has severe fever and cough and suffers from colicky pain and detestation for food, him no treatment can cure.
29.The man, whose head, tongue and face are distorted, whose brows droop low and whose tongue is covered with thorn-like fur, is verily like a dead man.
30. If the phallus is greatly shrun ken and the testes hang very loose, or vice versa, both these abnormal signs are suggestive of impending death.
31, The man, whose flesh is wasted and who is reduced to skin and bones, and who is fast fading and does not eat any food, does not survive longer than a month
Summary
Here is the recapitulatory verse—
32.The man that knows these many symptoms which forebode the death of a person, is a skilful physician that earns the title of the “Knower of the Science of Life”.
7. Thus, in the Section on Sensorial Prognosis, in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the seventh chapter entitled “The Sensorial prognosis from the observation of the loss of the reflected image in the eye [pannarupa]” is completed.
Prognostics of the Eye lashes
4. If a man’s eye-lashes get matted and his sight becomes fixed, the wise physician should not try to treat him.
5. If the eye-lids of a wasting patient are swollen and do not meet each other, and the eyes are smeared, he is to be regarded as a dead man.
Prognostics of the Hair
6. If either in a man’s eye-brows or in his hair there appear many lines like the parting of the hair or whirls, which neither previously existed nor were man-made, the physician should prognosticate impending death.
7. With these aforesaid signs an ailing man survives only three days, while the unailing one survives six nights at the most.
8. The man, who feels no sensation when his hairs are tugged at and pulled out by the roots, will not survive longer than six nights, be he healthy or ailing.
9. The man whose hair shines as if anointed though not anointed, him should the wise man avoid, knowing him to have come to the end of his life.
Prognostics of the Nose
10 The man whose nose ridge has become depressed and broadened, and who looks as if swollen though actually not swollen, is not to be treated by the wise physician.
11. The man, whose nose is extremely expanded or extremely contracted or distorted or extremely dry, does not survive long.
Prognostics of the Lips
12. If a man’s face, ears and lips develop an abnormal shade of pale, dark or very red or blue color, he cannot be cured of the disease.
Prognostics of the Teeth
13. If a man’s teeth become morbidly pale white, or slimy, or acquire blots, he will never get free of his disease and be restored to good health,
Prognostics of the Tongue
14. The tongue that is either rigid, insensible, heavy, covered all over with thorn like excessive fur, dark brown, either shrunken or swollen and projecting out is to be regarded as the tongue of a dead man
Prognostics of the Respiration
15. The man that having breathed out a long expiration followed by a short inspiration faints, should be avoided by the wise physician, knowing him to have come to the end of his life.
Other Fatal Prognostics
16. If the hands, feet, the sides of the neck and the palate become very cold or very hard or very soft, it denotes the fading away of life.
17. The patient that strikes the knees against each other and lifting the feet, throws them down violently and turns his face constantly, will not survive.
18. The patient that bites the tips of his nails with his teeth, or clips the hair with his nails, or scratches the earth with a stick, will not recover from his disease.
19.The patient that while awake gnashes his teeth and weeps aud laughs loudly and is not aware of pain, will not recover from disease.
20. The ailing man th t repeatedly laughs and shouts and strikes the bed with feet while fingering his eyes, ears and nose, will not survive long.
21, The debilitated patient, who becomes averse to the very things in the possession of which he used formerly to find his greatest delight, should be regarded to be on the verge of death.
22. The patient whose neck is unable to bear the weight of the head, whose back is unable to bear its own weight and whose jaws cannot retain the morsel of food put into the mouth, is about to die.
23. Sudden incidence of fever, thirst, fainting, loss of strength and looseness of the joints occur in the man that is about to die.
24. If the man that is suffering from Kapha-born fever, perspires profusely in the face at dawn, it is difficult for him to survive.
25.When a man has come to the end of his life, the food ingested does not reach the throat and his strength ebbs away.
26. The man that is about to die throws his head about and lets fall his forearms loose with difficulty, his forehead is covered with streaming sweat and his joints become lax.
Summary
Here is the recapitulatory verse—
27. The wise man should diligently observe these signs and symptoms occurring in dying men, as some of the symptoms emerge and manifest themselves suddenly. There are none, however, which do not bear fruit.
8. Thus, in the Section on Sensorial Prognosis, in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the eighth chapter entitled “The Sensorial prognosis from the observation of the inverted position of the reflection [avakshiras]” is completed.
Fatal prognosis of Consumption
6. Consumption will destroy the man whose body shines bright in its terminals and is getting emaciated, and whose strength is waning.
7. The sense of burning in the shoulder region hiccup, vomiting of blood, distension of the stomach and pain in the sides, occurring in a consumptive patient, mark the end
8-9 Those that suffer from diseases of Vata or epilepsy, or dermatosis, or edema, abdominal disorders, Gulma, diabetes or consumption, if they also suffer loss of strength and flesh, become incurable. Patients suffering from other diseases too, who are of this description—debilitated and emaciated, should be avoided by the physician.
Fatal prognosis in Abnormal distension
10. If the man whose abdominal distension is relieved by purgation, develops thirst and distension in spite of being purged, that man is as good as dead,
11. The man that is unable to drink a beverage on account of the dryness of the throat, mouth and the gullet, does not survive long.
Other Fatal prognostics
12 The faint condition of the voice, the loss of strength and bodycolor, and the untoward development of symptoms—seeing these, the physician should recognise the approach of death.
13. The man whose breathing has been shallow, who has lost his body-heat, who feels piercing pains in the groins and experiences not a moment of comfort, should be given up by the wise physician as incurable.
14. The man that speaks in an unnatural voice about his approaching death, or who hears sounds that do hot exist, should be avoided from distance.
15. If disease leaves the weakened patient all of a sudden, Atreya is of opinion that his life is in danger.
16. If the patient’s kinsmen beseech the physician with great importunity for treatment, he should prescribe the diet of meat-juice; but purificatory therapy should be administered.
17. And if, at the end of a month there is no sign of improvement as the result of the diet of meat-juice and varied other nutritive agents, then the patient’s survival is to be despaired of.
18. If a man’s sputum, feces and semen sink if cast into water, the wise physicians say that he has come to the end of bis life
19. The man whose sputum displays streaks of various colors and which sinks when placed in water, cannot survive long
20. The morbid condition in which the Pitta, arising from heat, mounts up to the temples and accumulates there, is known by the name of ‘Shankhaka [śaṅkhaka]’. It kills its victim within three nights.
21. The man from whose mouth issue blood and foam together repeatedly and who suffers from piercing pains in the stomach, should be refused treatment by the physician.
22. The patient who suffers from rapid loss of strength and flesh, aggravation of disease-symptoms and anorexia, does not live to complete three fortnights.
Study of Prognostics Essential
Here are the two recapitulatory verses—
23 These are the signs and symptoms occurring in men that are about to die These should be carefully observed, as also other symptoms of this kind
24. All of these are known to occur in such men as are about to die though they do not all occur in the same dying patient. Hence, the need for the physician to be conversant with all the signs and symptoms, prognosticative of death.
9. Thus, in the Section on Sensorial Prognosis, in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Carat a, the ninth chapter entitled “The Sensorial prognosis from the observation of the dark-brown color of the eye of a man” is completed.
The Benefit of the knowledge of such prognostics
Here is the recapitulatory verse—
21. He who recognises correctly these characteristics, knows beforehand the survival or the death of patients.
10. Thus, in the Section on Sensorial Prognosis in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the tenth chapter entitled “The Sensorial prognosis from the observation of the symptoms of Imminent Death [i.e., sadyas-marana]” is completed.
Symptoms of death within a year
3.The man, whose vital heat is reduced and is all but extinguished, whose mind is distracted, whose aura has become morbid, who has become perpetually weak-minded and who finds no pleasure in life, goes to the regions of the dead within a year.
4. The man whose offerings to the manes are not eaten by crows or other birds, goes to the other world within a year and eats the obsequial offerings made to him by his progeny.
5. The man who cannot see the star named Arundhati which is adjacent to the constellation called the Seven Sages (the Great Bear), will see the darkness of death within a year
6. If a man acquires or loses his splendor, robustness and wealth without any knowable curse and in an abnormal manner, his life will terminate in a year.
Symptoms of Death within Six Months
7. Inclinations, good conduct, memory, the spirit of sacrifice, judgment and strength desert without any reason the man that is to die within six months.
8 The man on whose forehead is seen a shining and prominent net-work of vessels which were not seen there before, dies within six months.
9. The life of the man on whose forehead develop crescent-shaped furrows, is to be judged as coming to his end within six months.
Symptoms of Death within a Month
10 The man who develops body-tremors, stupor, gait and speech resembling those of an intoxicated man, dies before the end of a month,
11. The man whose semen, urine and feces sink in water and who hates his own kinsmen, will himself sink into the waters of death within a month
12 The man, whose hands, feet and face are emaciated or edematous in a greater degree than the rest of the body, does not live even a month
13. The man, on whose forehead, head and hypogastric region appear dark-blue lines curved like the crescent, cannot survive.
14.The man on whose body appear and quickly disappear eruptions resembling coral beads, perishes before long.
15. The man who suffers from acute squeezing pains in the neck, swelling of the tongue and extensive suppurations of the inguinal region, the mouth and the throat, should be regarded as ripe for death.
16. Extreme confusion of mind, excessive delirious talk and exceedingly breaking pains in the bones, these three, afflict the man that is caught up in the noose of death.
17. Goaded by the impending death, the dying man, losing his wits, will pull out his hair and consume excessive quantity of food as if he were in perfect health, though he is weak.
18. The man, that is blinded by approaching death, holds his fingers in front of his eyes and searches about for them; he looks astonished and has a fixed upward gaze.
19. The man gropes seeking imaginary things on his bed or seat or on his limbs, on sticks or on the wall, becoming a victim to hallucination caused by the approach of death.
20. The man, that being deluded, laughs where there is no cause for laughter and smacks his lips, and whose feet, hands and breath are cold, does not survive.
21. The man whose mind is covered with the great delusion of death aud who calls out for a person that is at hand, be he a kinsman or otherwise, as though he were outside his vision’s range, cannot see though endowed with sight-
22. The wise physician, on observing that the patient’s body exhibits, simultaneously, both excessive and deficient response to sense-stimuli, such as sound etc., should abstain from treating him.
23. Owing to the extreme aggravation of disease and deterioration in the strength of the mind, the embodied spirit hurries out of the tabernacle of the body.
24. When life is ebbing away, there is general waning of the complexion and the voice, of the strength of the gastric fire and of the mind, and sleep either disappears altogether or claims the person for ever.
25 Those, that have begun to hate the physicians, medicine, food and drink, spiritual teachers and friends, are to be recognised as being already under the grip of that impartial god, Death.
26. In such people, the disease progresses unchecked, while the effect of medicine is neutralised Never should one eat the food offered by them nor even touch the water in their households.
27. The presence of all the four basic factors of treatment in all their plentitude of desirable qualities, is of ro avail with regard to the man who has come to the end of his life, even as in the absence of substance (namely life-span), there can be no emergence of quality (cure from disease).
In praise of investigation of the Span of life
28. The physician should study the prognostic signs of life both in the healthy and in the ailing. For it is only to the man who knows the prognostic signs of life that the full fruits of the science of life accrue.
Fatal prognostics
Here is the recapitulatory verse—
29, The indication which the morbid humors give of their having transcended the stage of treatment and having pervaded throughout the entire body, is called the evil symptom (ariṣṭa [ariṣṭa]) prognosticative of death.
11. Thus, in the Section on Sensorial Prognosis in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the eleventh chapter entitled “The Sensorial prognosis from the observation of the Loss of the Vital Heat” is completed.
Fatal prognostics with reference to Medicine and Food
6.The patient, on whom the physician, though trying his best, is unable to effect the application of the needed therapeutic agent or measure, will hardly survive his disease.
7. The patient in whose case well-known and tested remedies fail, even though they have been administerd strictly according to rules, is obviously immedicable.
8. The patient who fails to obtain any benefit from his observance of the dietetic regimen prescribed by the physician, will hardly survive his disease.
Fatal prognostics with reference to the Approach of the Messenger
9. We shall now describe the unfavorable prognostic signs in so far as they relate to the messenger. Observing these signs, the wise physician should unhesitatingly refuse treatment.
10. If the physician, while dishevelled, naked, weeping or not ceremonially clean, sees the messenger coming, he should, conclude within himself that the patient is going to die.
11. If messengers come to the physician while he is asleep or in the act of cutting or splitting something, the physician should not go to treat their master.
12. The messengers that approach the physician while he is in the act of tending the sacrificial fire, or offering food-balls to the manes, portend death and destruction to their master’s life.
13. They are the messengers of doom to the patient, win approach the physician when he is talking or thinking of inauspicious things.
14. If the messengers approach the physician while he is dealing with or talking about dead, burnt or destroyed things or other inauspicious matters, the patient is destined to?die.
15. If the messenger approaches tie physician in a place aud. at a time that have an affinity with the disease that affects the patient, the physician observing it, should abstain from treating the patient.
16. If the messenger that comes to the physician happens to be a woman that is miserable, frightened, hurried, terrified, unclean or of a bad character, or if the messengers be three in number, or if they be deformed or eunuch, the physician should prognosticate the patient’s death.
17. If the messenger happens to be mutilated in any of his limbs, or if he is an ascetic or a diseased man, or one given to cruel deeds, seeing him, the physician should not go to treat the patient
18. Seeing the messenger that has come on behalf of the patient r ding in a carriage drawn by a donkey or camel, the physician should foresee the patient's collapse.
19-20. Straw[?], chaff, flesh, bones, hair, nails, teeth, broom, pounding stick, winnowing basket, loosened bits of leather from a shoe, straw, sticks, husk, cinders, clod of earth or stone—if the messengers he touching any of these when the physician first sees them, they forebode the patient’s death.
21-21½. When the messenger is talking to the physician about the patient’s condition, if the physician sees evil omens, he should not go to treat the patient. Similarly, on seeing a sorrowing man, a dead body, or the adornments suitable to a corpse, the, physician should not go to the patient.
22-24½. Likewise, if he fees things that are broken, burning or destroyed or hears words denoting them, or tastes pungent and acute things or smells rank odors as of a corpse or touches objects having an exceedingly harsh feel, or in short, perceives about him any such other inauspicious sensation, whether before or during the speech of tin messenger, the wise physician should conclude the death of the patient. Thus have been declared in full, the signs of unfavorable prognosis, as they relate to the messenger
Prognostics with reference to the physician’s approach to the patient
25-30. Now I shall declare the inauspicious omens appearing on the way, or in the patient’s home Sneezing, shrilling, stumbling, falling, shouting, blows, forbiddance, reviling, any untoward accident to the clothes, the turban, the upper garment, the umbrella or to the pair of sandals, getting the sight of a corpse or a mutilated person, or the filling of a totem-tree, flag staff, flag or filled pots, reports of death and inauspicious things, pollution by ashes or dust, the crossing of the road by a cat, dog, or snake, cries of cruel beasts and birds as they go towards the south, the sight of over turned beds, seats and carriages—all these are said to be inauspicious omens by the wise.
31-31½. The wise physician seeing such sights on his way or hearing such sounds in the patient’s house, should not proceed to the patient’s house.
Thus have been described the portents considered as unfavourable when metrwith on the way to the patient’s house by the physician.
Prognostics with reference to the Circumstances in the Patien’s Dwelling
32-34. Learn now the ill omens to be met in the home of the patient doomed to death. Thus immediately on entering the house of the doomed patient, the physician sees a pot full of water, fire, earth, seeds, fruit, ghee, a bull, a brahmin, precious stones, cooked food or idols of gods—all coming out, or the sight of vessels containing fire, either broken or with the fire extinguished in them.
35 The people in the house of the patient who is destined to die will be found using things that are broken to bits, burnt, split, or crashed or frail.
36. There is no remedy for the man whose bed, clothes, carriage, movement, food and voice are inauspicious in aspect.
37. The man whose relations arrange the bed, clothing, carriage or other accoutrements in the manner suited to a corpse, is indeed a corpse.
38. There is no remedy for the man whose food gets exceedingly rotten or whose fire in the hearth gets extinguished though there is no wind and there is plenty of fuel.
39. If the vessels in the patient’s house fall or break very often, the life of that patient is difficult to save.
Recapitulation of the whole section
Here are verses again—
40-41. The signs portending death that have been described at length in the preceding twelve chapters, we shall describe again in brief and in different words. The re exposition of a subject in diffent words makes for the elucidation of the meaning.
42. We do not, however intend here a very elaborate representation of the subject, since it has been fully set forth in the foregoing chapters.
43-45. I shall now describe, as proposed and in keeping with the authority of scripture, the premonitory signs and symptoms of death and the changes that take place in those embodied souls who are in the last period of their lives and are about to meet their end, who are on the eve of departing to the other world, who are about to relinquish dear life and leave this beautiful habitation behind, and who, on breaking up of the organic unity of the body, are precipitated into final darkness.
46. These are the changes that occur in them:—the life-breaths become afflicted; the understanding becomes clouded; the limbs are drained of vitality; the movements gradually cease,
47. The senses are put out of action; consciousness gels blurred; the mind becomes restless and fear enters into it.
48. Memory and intelligence depart, natural modesty and bloom slip away; diseases born of sinfulness afflict him; vitality and lustre vanish.
49. Natural dispositions suffer a complete change and inclinations become perverted; the reflections become deformed; the aura, too, suffers distortion.
53. The semen is expelled from its place; the Vata goes astray; the flesh wastes away; the blood, too, suffers diminution.
51. The various thermal processes ebb away; the jo:nts become loose, the smells emanating from the body become abnormal; complexion and voice likewise suffer alteration.
52. The body undergoes discoloration; the body-channels become contracted; smoke springs from the head as also the powdery stuff recorded as a fatal prognostic sign.
53. The body-parts which are seen constantly to pulsate, will cease to move altogether all of them becoming rigid.
54, The qualities of the various parts of the body such as cold, heat, softness and hardness are observed to be reversed and similar are the experiences with other things outside the body.
55. Flower-like spots show in the nails and sordes appears on the teeth, the eye-lashes become clotted and partings appear in the hair of the head.
56. The physician does not succeed in obtaining the necessary drugs; such drugs as can be obtained fail to produce their proper action.
57. Fell maladies of diverse description requiring various lines of treatment, crop up in no time, over-powering the patient’s strength and vitality.
58. Only inauspicious sounds, touch, tastes, sights, smells, actions and thoughts assail the physician during the conduct of the treatment.
59. Evil dreams are seen; the patient’s dispositions become evil; the attendants turn hostile; death symptoms appear.
60. The healthy signs dwindle down exceedingly and the morbid signs rapidly increase. In short, all the ominous and unfavourable prognostic signs are observed
61. Such are the signs and symptoms of those, who are about to die, which we have set forth according to our declaration and in conformity to traditional authority.
Fatal prognosis not to be divulged by the physician
62.The knower of the medical science should not declare the approach of death, if he is not questioned concerning it, although he clearly perceives the signs prognosticative of the end.
63. Even if he’is questioned, the physician should not immediately pronounce the prognosis of death where such inconsiderate action on the part of the physician, may cause shock to the patient and distress to others,
64. While refraining from anouncing the approach of the end, the experienced physician should not however undertake treatment in a case where he finds that the prognostic signs of death are present.
65-66. But if the physician observes signs which are of a contrary character to those laid down as prognosticative of death, he should certainly declare the approach of recovery as indicated by the auspicious nature of the signs relating to the messengers, the omens met on the way, the circumstances obtaining in the patient’s household, the behaviour and disposition of the patient and the happy circumstances of wealth and abundance of the required materials at his disposal,
Auspicious omens pertaining to the Messenger etc.
67-70. The physician should regard the messenger of the following description as auspicious, i.e., indicative of favourable prognosis for the patient. One who is of good conduct, of pleasant demeanour, whole of body, of good report, clad in white garments, unshaven of his head, unmatted of his hair, of the same caste, style of dress and occupation as the patient, not seated in a vehicle [driven][?] by a camel or a donkey, arriving at times other than those marked by the two twilights, inauspicious conjunction of planets, constellations which are unstable and of a fierce or baleful aspect, the ‘void’ days of the fortnight comprising the fourth, ninth and fourteenth days, the mid-day and the midnight, earth-quake, eclipse, traversing over country which is not unholy and meeting with omens that are not untoward.

Summary
Here are the two recapitulatory verses—
89. In this chapter entitled “The appearance of powdery stuff resembling the Cow-dung powder,” the prognostic signs of death and of restoration to good health have been hid down with reference to the messengers, dreams, the patient, omens met on the way, application of therapeutic measures and success.
90. Thus, we have propounded the subject under consideration correctly. The student of the medical science should pay constant heed to it. Thus alone will he become a successful practitioner, securing for himself success, enduring fame and riches.
12. Thus, in the Section on Sensorial Prognosis, in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the twelfth chapter entitled “The Sensorial prognosis through the obserevation of the Powder resembling Cowdung Powder [i.e., gomaya-curna]” is completed.
Two Kinds of Medicine
4. Now, medicine is of two kinds—one kind is promotive of vigor in the healthy; the other, destructive of disease in the ailing-
5. The opposite of medicine is also of two kinds—one causing immediate disorders and the other causing remote ill-effects
6. What has been described as promotive of vigor in the healthy is, in the main, virilific and promotive of vitality; the other is, in the main, regarded, as alleviative of disease. The term ‘in the main’ means ‘in a special degree.’ For, either kind in fact performs the work of both in more or less degree.
7-8. Long life, heightened memory and intelligence, freedom from disease, youth, excellence of lustre, complexion and of voice, optimum strength of body and senses, utterance that always gets fulfilled, the reverence of people, body-glow—all these does a man obtain by the use of vitalizers. The vitalizers are so called because they help to replenish the vital fluids of the body.
9-12. Whatever ensures the perpetuation of one's lineage, causes immediate exhilaration of spirits, enables one to approach women in an unfrustrated manner, endowing him with great strength like to that of a stallion, makes one greatly endearing to women, increases one's proportions and strength, causes the seminal secretion even of the aging to remain undiminished and fertile, establishes a man, by surrounding him with many and excellent offsprings, in the honor and respect of people, like to a great tree with many and wide-sweeping branches and like to a high monument secures for ore after death the earthly immortality that rests on posterity and finally confers fame, prosperity, strength and robustness; that is designated (Vājīkaraṇa [vājīkaraṇa]) virilific.
13. That medicine, which has thus been described to be of two kinds, is vitalizing and is indicated in the healthy As regards the other kind, which destroys disease, we shall describe it in the Section on Therapeutics.
14. By Treatment we mean such therapeutic measures as are employed against diseases. We shall first describe the procedure of vitalization and that of virilification.
15. That which is of a contrary character to medicine is to be known as “Contra-medicine”. It is unfit for use. Accordingly we shall confine to describing that which alone is fit for use.
Two Modes of Vitalization
16. The sages adumbrated two modes of administering vitalization—one by immurement in a retreat; the other by recourse to air and sun baths.
17-23. We shall set down the procedure regarding the immurement therapy. In an area resided in by princes, physicians, the twice-born communities, saintly men and men of virtuous deeds, free from alarm, salubrious, close to a city, where the necessary appurtenances may be had, one should, having selected a good site, cause a retreat to be built with its face towards either the east or the north. It should be of the following description; high roofed and commodious; built in three concentric courts; furnished with narrow ventilators; thick-walled; congenial in all weathers; well lighted; pleasing to the mind; proof against noises and other disturbing agents; untenanted by women; equipped with all the requisite appurtenances; and having physicians, medicines and Brahman as ready at call. Thereafter, during the sun’s northern course, in the bright half of the month, when the day (tithi) and the constellation are propitious and the Muhurta [muhūrta] and Karana [karaṇa] are favorable, the man seeking vitalization should getting shaven, enter the retreat, having fortified himself in his resolution and purpose, full of faith and single-mindedness, having cast off all sins of the heart, cherishing good will for all creatures, having first worshipped the gods and the a the twice-born, and having performed the circumambulation of the gods, the cows and the Brahmanas.
24. Therein, being cleansed with the purificatory measures and on having regained his happiness and normal strength, he should undergo the vitalization procedure. We shall first describe the cleansing procedure.
The purificatory procedure
25-27. A person desiring vitalization should, after he has been subjected to the sudation and oleation procedures, drink with warm water, the powder of chebulic myrobalans, rocksalt, emblic myrobalans, gur, sweet flag, embelia, turmeric, long pepper and dry ginger, all of equal parts After his body has thus been cleansed and he has been put on a rehabilitatory diet, he should be given to drink thin barley-gruel mixed with ghee, for a period either of three nights or five days or seven days, until bis intestines have been purged of all fecal accumulations.
28. On being satisfied that' the person’s bowels have been properly cleansed, the physician, versed in the knowledge of age, habitus and homologation, should administer that procedure of vitalization which may be found suitable in each given case.
The Qualities of Chebulic Myrobalan
29-34. The chebulic myrobalan, it should be known, contains, all the tastes except one, i.e., the salt taste, is hot, beneficial, corrective of the humors, light, stimulative of the gastric fire and digestive, promotive of life, roborant, auspicious, the best of vitalizers, a panacea, promotive of the intellect and sense-vigour. The chebulic myrobalan is a quick subduer of the following disorders:—dermatosis, gulma, misperistalsis, consumption, anemia, intoxication, piles, the assimilation disorders, chronic irregular fever, cardiac disorders, diseases of the head, diarrhea, anorexia, cough, urinary anomalies, abdominal distension, splenic disorders, recent abdominal affections, discharge of mucus, hoarseness of voice, impairment of complexion, jaundice, helminthiasis, edema, asthma, vomiting, impotence, lassitude of the limbs, various kinds of obstruction of body-channels, collection of fluids or fat about the lungs or the heart, and stupefaction of memory and understanding.
35. Dyspeptics, eaters of ‘dry’ foods, those who have been weakened by indulgence in women, drink and poisonous addictions, and those who are afflicted with hunger, thirst and heat, should not take the chebulic myrobalan [abhaya]; that is to say, it is contra-indicated in such conditions.
The Qualities of Emblic Myrobalan
36-37. It should be known that all these virtues spoken of in connection with the chebulic myrobalan are also found in the emblic myrobalan [amalaki]; the potency, however, is of the opposite type. In view of the above consideration, the physician should esteem the pulp of both chebulic and emblic myrobalans as being equal in virtue to nectar, the food of the gods itself.
38-40 The best of habitats for medicinal plants is the Himalayas, the most majestic of mountains. It is the fruits grown in the Himalayas that are therefore to be properly culled every season, selecting such fruits, as are in season, rich with juice and potency, mellowed by the sun, wind, shade and water, unnibbled at by bird or beast, unspoiled, and unmarked with cuts or diseases. We shall now describe the modes of administration and the excellent effects of these fruits.
Brahma Vitalization
41-47. Take forty tolas of each of the five groups of penta-radices, a thousand fruits of chebulic myrobalans and thrice that number of fresh emblic myrobalans. The five groups, each group c insisting of five roots, are as follows:—(a) Ticktrefoil, Indian nightshade, painted leaved uraria, yellow berried night-shade and small caltrops, constitute the first group called ‘The ticktrefoil group.’ (b) Bael tree, wind killer, Indian calosanthes, white teak and wild snake gourd, constitute the second group called ‘The bael group.’ c) Hogs weed, the two Shurpa parnis [śūrpaparṇī] viz; wild green gram, and wild black gram, heartleaved sida and castor oil plant constitute the third group called ‘The castor oil plant group.’ (d) Jivaka, Rishabhaka, Meda, cork swallow wort and climbing asparagus constitute, the fourth group called ‘The Jivaka group,’ (e) Small sacrificial grass, sugar-cane, sacrificial grass, [thatch grass][?] and paddy roots constitute the fifth group called ‘The grass group.’ Of each of these five groups of penta radices, take as instructed above and mixing them boil the whole in ten times the quantity of water; when the decoction is boiled down to a tenth of its quantity, it should be filtered and the fluid part kept Take now the fruits of the chebulic and emblic myrobalans and after deseeding and crushing them in a mortar with a pestle, throw the pulp into the decoction mentioned above.
48-53. Add to this the powder of the following, the measure of each ingredient being 16 tolas; Indian pennywort, long pepper, kidney leaved ipomea, rush-nut, nut grus, embelia, sandal wood, aloe wood liquorice, turmeric, sweet flag, fragrant poon, the small cardamom and cinnamon Add to this the powder of sugar-candy, measuring 4,400 tolas in weight, 512 tolas of oil and 768 tolas of ghee. Boil all this in a copper vessel on a low fire, taking care to see that the decoction has changed into a linctus but is not burnt Take it down and after it has cooled, add honey to it. The measure of honey to be added is half that of the oil and ghee combined The whole linctus should be kept well-mixed in an earthen jar which has been situ rated with ghee. It may then be administered in proper dosage and at the proper time. The dose should be such as not to interfere with the taking of the patient’s meals. When the medicine his been digested, the patient should be given to eat a dish of Shashtika rice with cow’s milk.
54-56. The hermits known as the Vaikhanasas and the Valakhilyas and likewise other celebrated ascetics attained immense longevity from the use of this Rasayana. Shuffling off their decayed bodies, they secured for themselves fresh youth, freed themselves from langour, weariness and dyspnea and were unhampered by disease, were single-minded, and endowed with intelligence memory and strength. These mighty ascetics practised spiritual austerities and celibacy for unending years with exceeding devotion.
57. This divine Rasayana should be made use of by one who desires long life; by so doing, he will attain longevity, rejuvenation and all the desires of his heart Thus has been described the Brahma Rasayana.
Brahma Vitalizer
58. Take a thousand fruits of the emblic myrobalan, of the qualities described above. Soften them well by the steam-process by keeping over a kettle of boiling milk, and dry them in the shade and after de-seeding them, crash them to powder. This powder should then be macerated in the expressed juice of a thousand fresh fruits of the emblic myrobalan. Add to it the following, each of the measure of an eighth part of the powder of the emblic myrobalan. Tick-trefoil, hog’s weed, cork swallow wort, gingo fruit, heliotrope, Indian penny wort, climbing asparagus, kidney leaved ipomea, long pepper, sweet flag, embelia, cowage, guduch, sandal-wood, eagle-wood, liquorice and flowers of mahwa, blue water lily, lotus, arabian jasmine, rose, small jasmine and yellow jasmine; the compound should then he macerated in the expressed juice of 4,000 tolas of gingo fruit plant. It should then be dried in the shade. Ghee of twice the measure or ghee and honey of twice the measure should then be mixed with it. The whole mass should be reduced to look like liquid gur and kept in a clean and strong earthen vessel that has been saturated with ghee The vessel, having been sealed and made secure by one who is versed in the Atharva-veda, should be deposited under-ground below a heap of ashes, for a fortnight. When the prescribed period is over, it should be unearthed and the contents mixed with the powder of gold, silver, copper, coral and iron, the measure of these being one eighth of the whole mass. It should be taken each morning in a gradually increasing dope, beginning with half a tola, with due heed to one’s strength of digestion. When the dose has been fully digested, a meal consisting of cooked Shashtika rice and milk seasoned with ghee, should be eaten. Taking this medicine in this manner, one attains all the benefits described earlier in the case of the first Brahma Rasayana.
Here are verses again—
59-61 The Brahma Rasayana described above was made use of by the great sages. Using it, one becomes immune to disease, long-lived, endowed with great strength, attractive to people, fulfilled of desires and equal in lustre to the sun and the moon. One will be able to retain in memory all that one has heard, and will possess the mental faculties of the seers. One will moreover, have a frame like adamant and strength like that of the wind. In such a body even poison will be rendered innocuous. Thus has been described the second Brahma Rasayana

Take 4 tolas of each of the following: Bael, wind killer, Indian trumpet flower, white teak, trumpet flower, heart leaved sida, the four Parnis, ticktrefoil, painted leaved uraria, wild green gram and wild black gram, long pepper, small caltrops, Indian night shade and yellow berried nightshade, galls, ground phylanthus, grapes, cork swallow-wort, german iris, eagle-wood, chebulic myrobalans [abhaya], heart-leaved moon-seed, Riddhi, Jivaka, Rishabhaka, zedoary, nut grass, hog’s weed, Meda, cardamom, sandal wood, blue lily, white yam, Vasiki root, Kakoli, and small stinking swallow wort; to these add five hundred fruits of the emblic myrobalans [amalaki]. Boil the whole in 1024 tolas of water. On ascertaining that the drugs have been thoroughly decocted, the brew together with emblic myrobalans, should be taken down. The myrobalans should be removed and de-seeded. They should then be fried in 48 tolas of ghee and oil The physician should then boil the fried substance in the decoction already obtained, adding to it two hundred tolas of pure candied sugar. He should keep stirring the whole with a clean iron ladle till it is reduced to the proper consistency; then it should be taken down. After it has cooled, mix it with 24 tolas of honey, 16 tolas of bamboo manna, 8 tolas of long pepper, 4 tolas of cinnamon bark, cardamoms, the leaves of the cinnamon tree and of fragrant poon combined, and all ground to powder. This is that very Cyavana-prasha [cyavanaprāśa], the elixir of the Rishi Cyavana, which is celebrated as the high est Rasayana [rasāyana]. It is specially recommended for the cure of cough and dyspnea and as a body-builder for the wasted, for those suffering from pectoral lesions, for the old and for children. It also subdues such disorders as loss of voice, diseases of the chest, diseases of the heart, thirst and disorders of the rheumatic condition.

Virtues of Vitalization
Here are verses again—
78-80. As is ambrosia to the immortals, as is the nectar to the serpents, so in the days of yore, was the procedure of vitalization to the great sages, These sages of yore, who were votaries of Rasayana, lived for thousands of years, transcending old age, infirmity, disease and even death itself. He who makes use of Rasayana in the prescribed manner, not merely attains longevity on the earth but dying, goes by the auspicious way of the divine sages and reaches the immutable Brahma itself.
Summary
Here is the recapitulatory verse—
81. In this quarter of the chapter on “The virtues of the Chebulic and Emblic myrobalans,” six tested recipes have been described of the therapy of vitalization whereby life is prolonged.
1-(1). Thus, in the Section on Therapeutics in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the first quarter of the first chapter on Vitalization entitled “The Virtues of the Chebulic (abhaya) and Emblic Myrobalans (amalaki)” is completed.
Preparation before Vitalization
3-(1). O, Ye, lovers of life [prana-kama]! listen to the ensuing exposition of vitalization which is like the very ambrosia—the blessing enjoyed by the sons of Aditi (the mother of gods). Vitalization is possessed of inconceivable and wonderful possibilities, being promotive of longevity and health, preservative of youth, dispersive of somnolence, torpor, fatigue, exhaustion, indolence and weakness; restorative of the balance of the Vata, Kapha aud Pitta; stabilizing; curative of flabbiness of the flesh; stimulative of the internal gastric fire and promotive of lustre, complexion and voice.
3-(2). By recourse to this vitalization, the great sages, such as Cyavana and others regained their youth, became most attractive to women, acquired compact, even and well-proportioned limbs, as also well-knit compact frames, unblemished strength. complexion and sense-faculties irresistible power in even thing and the capacity to bear all hardships.
3-(3). All ills of the body arise from addiction to an urban dietary, manifesting as they do in persons of the following description: consumers of sour, salt, pungent and alkaline articles dried vegetables, flesh, til, til paste and pastries; eaters of grains and pulses that have either begun to sprout or are very new or of other foods that are either disagreeable, non-homologous, dry, alkaline and deliquescent; partakers of softened^ heavy, putrid or stale foods, of meals at irregular times or in irregular quantities or too frequently i.e., over a stomach that has not yet recovered from the last meal; addicts to day-sleeping, sex-pleasures and wine-bibbing, persons whose bodies have been strained by faulty or inordinate indulgence in exercise; and victims to fear, anger, grief, greed, infatuation and over-work.
3-(4). It is on account of such practices that the muscles become flabby, the joints become loose, the blood becomes decomposed, the fat gets extremely liquefied, the marrow does not drug to the bone, the semen is not secreted in sufficient quantity and the vital essence becomes depleted. As the result of this, one becomes exh lusted, languid, and a victim to sleepiness, torpor and sluggishness; he gets dispirited and breathes hard. Such a man, rendered incapable of any bodily or mental labor, deprived of memory, intelligence and body-lustre, and turned into a home of diseases, fails to enjoy his full measure of life.
3 Therefore, having regard to such ills, one should, giving up the above mentioned unwholesome diet and regimen of life, avail oneself of vitalizing processes. Having observed thus, the worshipful Punarvasu Atreya spoke again and said—
The Emblic Myrobalan Ghee
4-(1). First cook in 256 tolas of ghee four times its quantity of the expressed juice of emblic myrobalans which are grown on a good soil, matured in the proper season, unimpared in respect of smell, color and taste aud endued with fulness of juice, size and potency, along with the paste of hog’s weed of one fourth part of the expressed juice of the emblic myrobalans. Then re-cook the whole thing in the expressed juice of white yam and the paste of cork swallow wort. Once again re-cook the whole with four times as much of milk and the decoction of heart-leaved sida and common mallow, together with the paste of climbing asparagus. In this manner, the concoction should be cooked a hundred times over or even a thousand times. It should then be mixed with sugar and honey of one fourth its quantity and the whole placed in a vessel, either of gold, silver or clay, clean and strong and lined with ghee. This preparation should be taken every morning according to the capacity of digestion and in conformity with the rules laid down earlier. After the dose has been fully digested, a meal of cooked Shali or Shashtika rice should be eaten supplemented by milk and ghee.
4. By the use of this vitalizer, one remains young for a hundred years, recollects all that one has heard, gets cured of all maladies, acquires unimpaired sex-vigor and becomes a parent of many children.
Here are two verses again—
5-6. The man who partakes of this vitalizing elixir will acquire a mighty frame hard as adamant and imbued with sense-faculties that are unwavering and are possessed of great energy, invincibility, great comeliness of form and the gifts of honor, worship and happiness of mind. He will also acquire great strength, purity of complexion, a voice like the thunder of massed rain-clouds, and numerous and enduring progeny. Thus has been described the Emblic Myrobalan Ghee
Emblic Myrobalan Linctus
7-(1). A thousand fruits of the emblic myrobalans together with a thousand fruits of long pepper should be soaked in the alkaline water prepared from the ashes of a you g palas When the myrobalans have become fully saturated, they should be dried in the shade; where after, the myrobalans should be de-seeded and ground along with fruits of long pepper into powder. To this should be added honey and ghee, each of four times the measure of the powder, and sugar one fourth the measure of the powder. Placing the whole thing in an earthen jar which has been saturated with ghee, it should be kept underground for a period of six months. On completion of the period, the linctus becomes fit for use It should be taken in the measure suited to one’s digestive capacity The time for taking it is forenoon, never the afternoon. As regards the dietetic rules, they are determined by the constitution of the user.

This paste should be mixed with 256 tolas of the powdered long pepper, 256 tolas of powdered grains of embelia, 384 tolas of powdered sugar and 512 tolas each of oil, honey and ghee; and the whole should be placed in a clean, strong, ghee-saturated earthen vessel and allowed to mature for a period of twenty-one nights Thereafter, it becomes fit for use,
10. As a result of the use of this recipe, the person lives a hundred years of youthful life as in the case of the previous recipes. Thus has been described “Another variety of Emblic Myrobalan Linctus”
Gingo fruit Vitalizer
11-(1). Collect roots of the gingo fruit plant of the following description and in the following manner. First as
regards description:—The plant to be selected must be found growing on dry scrub-land overgrown with sacred grass, in a soil that is sticky, black and sweet to the tiste, or in golden-colored loam, in a tract free from poisonous things, cruel animals and the ravages of wind, water and fire, not used for tillage, uncovered with ant-hills and far from a cremation ground, memorial structure, a barren saline patch, or habitation, and enjoying seasonal and pleasant breezes, rains and sunshine. The roots should be uncamaged, unsmothered by those of a neighbouring tree, neither too tender nor too old, and fully imbued with potency and of a plant that has shed its old leaves but has not yet put forth fresh ones. Now, concerning the time and mode of collection:—Either in the month of Magha or in that of Phalguua, the plant-collector who has previously purified and consecrated himself and has obtained the blessings of the Brahmanas in his expedition, should, choosing an auspicious Muhurta, pull out the gingo-fruit plant by its roots. After washing the roots thoroughly, their bark should be pounded into smooth paste to form a bolus either of the weight of four tolas or one tola and mixing this in milk, it should be made use of as potion early in the morning. Or the drug may be turned into powder and taken with milk; or the powder may be licked up mixed with honey and ghee. After it has been digested, the person should eat a dish of cooked Sali or Shashtika rice with milk and ghee

Take 256 tolas of the powder of the drug whose expressed juice is required, and keep it soaking in 258 tolas of water for a period of 24 hours; squeezing and straining that water, use it in place of the expressed juice.
The preparations of Marking nut
13-(1). Collect either in the month of Jyeshtha or Ashadha a quantity of marking nuts, which are undamaged, undiseased, conforming to the specifications as regards the juice, size and potency and of the color of ripe jambul fruits and store them in a heap of barley-corn or black gram, The nuts should be stored for a period of four months. They may be used in the month of Margashirsha or Pausha in the following manner, after the person wishing to take it has prepared his body with cooling unctuous and sweet articles.
13-(2). First of all, taking ten of the marking nuts and having crushed them in a mortar, boil the pulp well in eight times its quantity of water. When the decoction has boiled down to one eighth of its original quantity, it should be filtered and taken with milk, the mouth being previously smeared inside with ghee.
13-(3). Increase the number of the marking nuts by one each succeeding day, till the total becomes thirty; thereafter, decrease the number by one in the same manner till the initial number of ten is reached. This dose should not be exceeded. The maximum dose is thirty and minimum ten. This ascending and descending scale of dosage should be maintained until the total number of marking nuts consumed reaches a thousand. When the daily dose is fully digested, a meal of cooked Shali or Shashtika rice supplemented with milk and ghee, should be eaten. After the completion of the course, only two meals a day with milk should be taken.
13. By the course of this vitalizing drug for a period of one year, one attains the benefits enumerated earlier such as the retention of youth for a hundred years etc Thus has been described ‘The Marking-nut Milk’.

The qualities of Marking-nut
Here are verses again—
17. The marking-nut is hot, suppurative and fiery in character. Administered properly it rivals ambrosia itself.
18. The ten modes of its preparations have been described. The physician who is conversant with disease, habitus and homologation should prescribe the suitable preparations.
19. There is no disease born of Kapha or disorder partaking of the nature of constipation, which cannot be cured quickly by the use of marking-nut; it is also promotive of intelligence and the gastric fire, Thus ends the prescriptions relating to the Marking-nut.
20. In the beginning, the great sages such as Cyavana and others, having become aged but being moved by the urge for life [prana-kama], succeeded in prolonging their lives indefinitely by the use of excellent vitalizers.
21. These long-lived ones, having prosecuted spiritual austerities, celibacy and meditation of the spirit to their hearts’ content, betook themselves to heaven.
22. Hence those who are moved by the urge to live [prana-kama] and the quest for happiness, should, in order to have abundant life, betake themselves with great attention and in the prescribed manner, to the procedure of vitalization,
Summary
Here is the recapitulatory verse-
23. Thirty-seven infallible modes of the application of vitalizers have been set out in this quarter entitled ‘The Urge to Live [prana-kama]’ by the sage, the well-wisher of all creatures.
1-(2). Thus, in the Section on Therapeutics, in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the second quarter of the first chapter on Vitalization entitled “The Urge to Lived [prana-kama]” is completed.
Emblic Myrobalan Vitalizer Etc.
3. Of emblic myrobalans, agreeing with the description given earlier and plucked with the hand [i.e., kara-pracita] during the Phalguna or the Magha month, deseeded and dry-pounded, take 256 tolas of powder and macerate it in the expressed juice of fresh emblic myrobalans, repeating the process of maceration twenty-one times. Keep this apart. Now put together the several herbs coming under the five heads of decoctives namely, life-promoters, roborants, galactagogues, the seminiferous and rejuvenators described in the chapter entitled ‘The six hundred purgatives’ (chapter IV of Sutra Sthāna) and the pith of sandal-wood, crane tree, oojein, acacia, catechu, blackwood, sissoo tree, Asana, as algo chebulic myrobalans, beleric myrobalans, long pepper, sweet flag, piper chaba, white-flowered leadwort and embelia. Cut all these up into bits and taking 256 tolas of them, cook in 2560 tolas of water till the decoction boils down to one tenth the quantity of water i.e. 256 tolas. Straining the decoction, put in it the powder of the emblic myrobalans spoken of at the outset and cook over a fire of dry cow-dung cakes or of bamboo splinters or the reeds of penreed grass, or of Tejana weeds, till all the water has evaporated, taking care to see that the stuff does not get burnt. Then spreading it on iron pans dry it. After it is thoroughly dried, grind it into a soft powder in a stonemortar placed above the skin of a black deer. Then store it carefully in an iron vessel. This powder mixed with one eighth its quantity of iron-powder, should be given with honey aud ghee according to the patient’s capacity of digestion.
Here are verses again—
4-5 Making regular use of this Rasayana long ago, Vasishtha, Kashyapa, Angiras, Jamadagni, Bharadvaja, Bhrigu and other sages like them, being self-controlled, by its virtue freed themselves from the fear of weariness, disease and old age and being endowed with great powers, carried on their austerities as long as they desired.
6. This vitalizing elixir, capable of keeping a man alive for a thousand years, a destroyer of old age and disease, and promoter of the powers of understanding and the senses, was first, invented by Brahma, the creator himself. Thus has been described “The Brahma vitalizer containing Emblic Myrobalans and Iron”.
7-8. The great sages in early times, living lives consecrated to austerity, celibacy, meditation and peace were able to secure longevity by means of the vitalization procedure, their lives being of indeterminate life-span. To be sure, there is no vitalizing drug or procedure that is efficacious in the case of persons who are worldlings, pre-occupied in other than spiritual or moral endeavour and are not selfcontrolled.
Simple Emblic Myrobalan Vitalizer
9-14. Let a man live continually for a year in the midst of kine, subsisting only on milk-diet and meditating in his mind on ‘Savitri,’ observing celibacy and keeping his senses under control. Thereafter, at the end of the year let him on a full-moon day of either Pausha, Magha or Phalguna month, having fasted for the three preceding days, enter a grove of emblic myrobalans. Getting up on a big tree with a plentiful crop of fruits on its stem, let him, holding in his hand a bunch of fruits, keep meditating on Brahman till ambrosia descends into the fruits. For, of a certainty, ambrosia dwells in the fruits of emblic myrobalans at such a moment and they become, by the presence of ambrosia, sweet to the taste like sugar or honey, unctuous and soft. As many fruits as he eats, so many millenniums does he live, with youth restored. Eating to his fill of such fruits, he becomes like unto the gods in splendour, and of their own accord the goddesses of Good fortune, Knowledge and of Speech will wait upon him in person. Thus has been described ‘The pure Emblic Myrobalan Vitalizer.’
Iron Vitalizer
15-20. Get some tempered steel beaten out into leaves 4 fingers long, and as thin as a til seed. Having heated them red-hot in the fire, dip them in order in the juice of the three myrobalans, in cow’s urine, in a solution of the alkali of staff-plant, or the alkalis prepared from zachum oil-plant and bengal kino in succession, repeating the heating process before such submersion. When after this process the steel leaves have turned black as collyrium, they should be ground into fine powder. Add to it sufficient honey and the fresh juice of emblic myrobalans to form the consistency of a linctus saturated with ghee. Placed in an earthen vessel, it should be kept in a granary of barley-corn for a whole year. During this period, it should be well-stirred once every month, and the wise pharmacist should take- care to see that the stirring up is thorough. At the end of the year, it should be taken with honey and ghee every morning, with due regard to one's strength of digestion. Wholesome meals should be eaten only after complete digestion of the medicine. This is the procedure laid down in the case of all metals.
21-22. A man who makes use of this elixir for a period of one year will become invulnerable to trauma, immune to diseases, to old age, and to death. He will have the vitality of an elephant and be ever endowed with great strength of the senses. He will acquire high intelligence, renown, eloquence, memory and opulence.
23. In the same manner, the use of elixirs made of other metals such as gold and silver, is promotive of longevity and a tried panacea. Thus has been described the procedure of elixirs made from iron and other metals.
Aindra Vitalizer
24-26. Take Aindri, Matsyakhyaka, Brahmi, sweet flag, Brahma-suvarcala, long pepper, rock salt, gold, small-leaved convolvulus, aconite and ghee. Take three barley grains’ weight of each of these drugs excluding gold, ghee and aconite. Add to this, two barley grains’ weight of gold, one til-seed’s weight of aconite and four tolas of ghee. Mixing all together, administer it. After it has been digested, the patient should be recommended to eat a meal with plenty of ghee and honey.
27-29. This tried elixir, named Ain dra Elixir is curative of old age and diseases, highly stimulative of memory and intelligence, promotive of longevity, plumpness and prosperity; it improves the voice and complexion, and is an excellent energiser. Neither poison nor disease can assail one who makes use of this elixir. By the use of this elixir, one obtains freedom from leucoderma and dermatosis, abdominal affections, Gulma, splenic disease, chronic and irregular fevers, diseases destructive of intelligence, memory and knowledge, and highly provoked disorders of Vata. Thus has been described ‘The Aindra Vitalizer’.
Brain Vitalizer
30. The expressed juice of Indian pennywort may be used as an elixir, so also the powder of liquorice with milk. The juice of guduch may similarly be used: likewise the paste of small-leaved convolvulus together with its roots and flowers.
31. These four drugs are promotive of life and curative of disease and they improve one’s strength, digestive power, complexion and voice. They are all brain-tonics, particularly the smallleaved convolvulus. Thus have been described ‘The Brain-tonic Vitalizers.’
Long pepper Vitalizer
32-35. One desirous of the benefits of vitalization may take five, eight, seven or ten long-peppers a day in conjunction with honey and ghee for a period of one year. A seeker after the benefits of vitalization who wishes to get rid of cough, consumption, wasting, dyspnea, hiccup, throat affections, piles, assimilation disorders, anemia, irregular fever, cacophonia, coryza, edema, gulma and Vata cum Kapha should take a course of long pepper impregnated with the alkali prepared of Bengal kino and fried in ghee. They should be taken in conjunction with honey, three in the morning, three before the midday meal and three after. Thus has been described ‘The Vitalization Procedure through a course of Long Pepper.’
36. Another course of long pepper consists in increasing the number of long pepper by ten every day for a period of ten days, beginning with ten long peppers on the first day. From the eleventh day, the number is to be reduced by ten every day till on the nineteenth day the number of long peppers returns to the original ten.
37-39. After each dose has been digested, cooked Shashtika rice should be eaten with milk and ghee, the whole course consisting of one, thousand long peppers. Long peppers should be taken in the form of paste by persons of high vitality. Those of middling vitality should take them in the form of decoction; while persons of low vitality should take them in the form of powder. The dose and mode should also correspond to the intensity and nature of the morbid humor and disease concerned. The course of long peppers, which begins with ten and returns to ten by a daily increase and decrease of ten, is the best; that which starts with six and returns to six by a daily increase and decrease is of moderate virtue; that which starts with three and returns to three by a daily increase and decrease of three is the lowest. This last is indicated in the case of persons of low vitality.
40. The vitalization procedure by means of long peppers is roborant, promotive of voice and longevity, curative of splenic disorders and abdominal affections, rejuvenating and a brain tonic. Thus has been described ‘The Vitalization Procedure of a daily increasing dose of Long Pepper.’
The three Myrobalan Vitalizers
41-42. One chebulic myrobalan together with honey and ghee on the completion of the digestion of the previous days meal, that is in the morning, two beleric myrobalans together with honey and ghee before the days meal and four emblic myrobalans together with honey and ghee after the meal by taking the three kinds of myrobalans in this manner for a full period of one year, one lives for a hundred years immune from disease and old age. Thus has been described ‘The first vitalization procedure by means of the Three Myrobalans.’
43-44. A new iron pan should be smeared with the paste of the three myrobalans and allowed to stay for a day and a night. The paste should be collected by washing the iron pan in honey-water (hydromel) and the solution drunk. When the potion has been digested, a meal with plenty of unctuous substance is recommended. By a year’s course of this procedure, one becomes free from old age and disease, and will live for a hundred years. Thus has been described ‘The second vitalization procedure by means of the Three Myrobalans.’
45. The three myrobalans make a tried vitalizing medication when combined with liquorice, bamboo manna, long pepper, honey, ghee and sugar. Thus has been described ‘The third vitalization procedure by means of -the three myrobalans.’
46-47. A course of the three myrobalans in combination with the five petals (tin, lead, copper, silver and iron), gold, sweet-flag, honey, ghee, embelia, long pepper and rock-salt, taken for a period of one year will promote intelligence memory and strength, increase the life-span, induce prosperity and dispel old age and disease. Thus has been described ‘The fourth vitalization procedure by means of the Three Myrobalans.’
Mineral pitch Vitalizer
48-54½. Mineral pitch is astringent, slightly acid in taste, pungent in post-digestive effect, neither very hot, nor very cold and is derived from the four minerals -gold, silver, copper and iron; when used systematically, it serves as a vitalizer besides acting as a virilific and a remedial agent in disease. When the various decoctions curative of Vata, Pitta and Kapha are made to impregnate the mineral pitch either all at once or one by one, its potency is -increased. The method of impregnating mineral pitch is to immerse it in lukewarm decoction of the specified drugs and to remove it and re-immerse it in the decoction which has again been rendered lukewarm. This process should be repeated for a period of seven days. Such mineral pitch when taken in milk, together with the powder of metals prepared according to the formula given earlier, will ensure long life crowned with happiness. This vitalizing elixir which removes old age and disease, gives great firmness of the body, increases intelligence and memory and promotes prosperity; it should he taken in conjunction with a milk diet. As regards the course of this vitalizing mineral pitch, it is divided into three classifications viz,, maximum, medium and minimum. The maximum consists of seven weeks; the medium of three weeks and the minimum of one week. As regards the dose, it is divided into three classifications—four tolas, two tolas and one tola.
55-61. Now, I shall describe the virtues pertaining to different varieties of mineral pitch, as also the procedure relating to the administration of each. Mineral pitch is the name given to that excretory stuff which is exuded by mountain-rocks loaded with gold and other metallic ores when heated by the rays of the sun and which resembles lac and is soft, clayey and clear. That variety of this stuff which is sweet and slightly bitter in taste, resembles the china rose in color, is pungent in post-digestive effect and cold, is the exudation from gold ore. The exudation from silver-ore is pungent in taste, white in hue, cold and sweet in post-digestive effect The exudation from copper ore is of the hue of the peacock’s throat, bitter in taste, hot and pungent in post-digestive effect. That exudation which is of the hue of gum guggul, bitter and slightly saltish in taste, pungent in post-digestive effect and cold, is from the iron ore. It is the best of all. All varieties of mineral pitch have the smell of cow’s urine and are suitable for use in all kinds of therapeutic measures, however, the last variety, the exudate of iron ore, is the one most esteemed in vitalizing procedures. The four kinds of exudations from the four kinds of metallic ore beginning with gold are specially recommended in disorders of Vata and Pitta, in disorders of Kapha and Pitta, in disorders of Kapha and in tridiscordance, in the respective order mentioned.
62-65. While taking a course of mineral pitch, care should be taken to see that irritating and heavy articles are excluded from the dietary. As regards horse-gram, it is prohibited at all times. Horse-gram has the quality of splitting rock and is in extreme opposition to the stony element. Accordingly, its use is prohibited as being incompatible with mineral pitch which is a stone-exudate. Milks, butter-milk, meat-juices, gruels, waters, cow’s urine and various kinds of decoctions are recommended for mixing with mineral pitch These should be made use of as required by the occasion. There is no curable disease on earth which mineral pitch cannot perforce subdue. When administered at right time, well prepared and in the right manner, it will Secure for the healthy subject the optimum measure of vitality. Thus has been described ‘The procedure of vitalization by means of Mineral Pitch.’
Summary
Here is the recapitulatory verse—
66. In this quarter entitled ‘Culled with the hand’ the great sage has given out the formulas of sixteen tried procedures of vitalization.
1-(3). Thus, in the Section on Therapeutics, in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the third quarter of the first chapter on Vitalization, entitled ‘Culled with the Hand [kara-pracita]’ is completed.
The Vitalization taught by indra
6. Then Indra, coming over to the sages, imported to them the immortal Science of Life. He concluded the initiation with the following injunctions: ‘All this must you do. This is the propitious time for carrying out the vitalizing therapy. Sovereign herbs growing in the Himalayas are ripe with potency. Such, for instance as Aindri, Brahmi, milky yam, Kshirapushpi, east Indian globe thistle, climbing asparagus, white yam, cork swallow-wort, hog’s weed, gingo fruit, ticktrefoil, sweet flag, wild dill, wild fennel, Meda, Mahameda—these and such other life-promoting drugs of proved virtue taken in conjunction with cow’s milk, secure for their user, after a course of six months, optimum length of life, youthful age, immunity from disease, excellence of voice and complexion, full physical growth, intelligence, memory, the highest kind of power, and all other desirable qualities.’ Thus has been described the vitalization procedure taught by Indra.
7-(1). There is a herb by the name of Brahma-suvarcala which exudes a golden colored sap, and has leaves resembling those of white lotus. The herb which is called ‘Adityaparni [ādityaparṇī]’ (‘Sun-leaved’) is also known by the name of ‘Suryakanta [sūryakāntā]’. It also exudes a golden colored sap and has flowers like the disk of the sun. The herb called ‘Nari [nārī?]’ which is also known by the name of ‘Ashvabala [aśvabalā]’ has petals resembling those of the Balvaja. The herb called ‘Kashthagodha [kāṣṭhagodhā]’ is shaped like the iguana; while the herb called ‘Sarpa [sarpa]’ has a form resembling the snake. The sovereign herb which is known by the name of ‘Soma’ hag fifteen joints for knots; it wanes and waxes like the moon. The herb called ‘Padma [padmā]’ is similar in shape to a lotus, is red like a lotus and smells too like a lotus. The herb called ‘Aja [ajā]’ is also spoken of as ‘Ajashringi [ajaśṛṅgī]’ The herb known as ‘Nila [nīlā]’ has blue sap and blue flowers. It is a creeper with luxuriant growth.
7. Out of the above-mentioned herbs, one should drink to one’s fill, the juices of such as are available; he should then lie down naked in a vat furnished with a lid, made of green bengal kino wood and saturated with ghee. Living like this, one’s body will dwindle down to nothing; in the course of six months he rises with a reformed body. His only sustenance shall be goat’s milk. On completing the course of six months, he becomes like the gods in the matter of youth, complexion, voice, form, strength and lustre. To him all excellences of speech come of their own accord. He becomes endowed with clairvoyance and clairaudience. He will be able to cover a thousand Yojanas at one stretch and will live for a period of ten thousand years without any ailment.
Here are verses again—
8. Only persons like you will be able to tolerate the strength of these sovereign herbs; un-self-controlled persons will be unable to bear it.
9. By the virtues of the herbs and by devotion to your duties, all the auspicious results will accrue to you.
10. It is only the hermits and house-holders that have pious and disciplined natures, that are competent to make use of these herbs born in this divine clime.
11. As regards those herbs too, which, in the matter of habitat and virtues, are of a middling order aud thus inferior to the Himalayan herbs in respect of potency, the mode of administration is the same.
12. For the benefit of those, who, while unable either to procure or tolerate the Himalayan herbs, seek, nevertheless, the blessings of vitalization, we recommend the following separate procedure.
13- 23. Collect separately the juice of each of the following drugs, the decade of each of the four groups tonics, life-promotives, roborants, and rejuvenators as also of catechu, feather foil, date, mahwa, nut-grass, blue lotus, grape, embelia, sweet-flag, white-flowered leadwort, climbing asparagus, milky yam, long pepper, eagle-wood, Riddhi, gingo fruit plant, Indian teak tree, crane-tree, the three myrobalans, Indian night shade, white yam, sandal wood, sugar-cane, roots of reed grass, white teak and oojein. These juices as also palas alkali should be taken in the measure of four tolas each and combined. This mixture should be further combined with four times its quantity of cow’s milk and 512 tolas each of til oil aud cow’s ghee. All this should be cooked in one vessel and the unctuous portion taken out. Add to the unctuous portion thus obtained, 256 tolas of the pulvis of emblic myrobalans which has been impregnated a hundred times in the fresh juice of the emblic myrobalans, 256 tolas of very fresh honey, 256 tolas of the powder of sugar-candy, and 64 tolas each of bamboo manna and long pepper. Mixing the whole thing well, allow it to mature for a fortnight in a perfectly clean earthen vessel which has been saturated previously with ghee. It should then be used in the dose commensurate with the digestive. power of the person concerned. This linctus should be mixed with one-sixteenth its quantity of the powders of gold, copper, coral, iron, crystal, pearls, cat’s-eye gem, conch-shell and silver.
The user should avoid during the course of treatment all strain and sexual activity. On digestion of the medicine, he should eat a meal consisting of Shashtika rice with milk and ghee.
24-26. This is a panacea, a virilific and the best promoter of longevity. It also promotes intelligence, memory, digestive power, understanding and acuity of the sense. It is, moreover, an excellent vitalizer and a promoter of complexion and voice. It is a talisman against poison and ill-luck and a giver of all blessings that speech can give. This Brahmic vitalizer of mighty potency, should be systematically used by those who, seek success in enterprise, new youth, popularity and renown in the world. Thus has been described ‘The Second Vitalizer revealed by Indra’
Immurement and Open air modes of Vitalization
27. The mode of immurement in a retreat is indicated in the case of those who are fit, diseaseless, strong-willed, self-controlled, leisured and endowed with means.
28. For those who are differently circumstanced, the mode laid down is that of exposure to sun and wind. The first mode of the procedure—immurement in a retreat, is no doubt the more excellent of them two but is indeed very difficult.
29.If disease supervenes as the result of incorrect application of the vitalizing procedure, the procedure should be forthwith suspended and the disorders duly treated.
Vitalizer of Good conduct
30-35. One who speaks the truth, who is free from anger, who abstains from alcohol and sexual congress, hurts no one, avoids over-strahi, is tranquil of heart, fair spoken, is devoted to repetition of holy chants and to cleanliness, is endowed with understanding, given to alms-giving, diligent in spiritual endeavour, delights in reverencing the gods, cows. Brahmanas, teachers, seniors and elders, is attached to non-violence, and is always compassionate, model ate, and balanced in his waking and sleeping, is given to regular taking of milk and ghee, is conversant with the science of clime, season and dosage, is versed in propriety, devoid of egotism, blameless of conduct, given to wholesome eating, spiritual in temperament, and attached to elders and men who are believers and self-controlled and devoted to scriptural texts; such a one should be known as enjoying the benefits of vitalization therapy constantly. If one who is endowed with all these qualities amakes age of vitalization therapy, that man will reap all the benefits of vitalization which have been described above. Thus has been described ‘The Vitalization procedure through Good Conduct.’
Vitalization only for the Pure in mind and body
36. No man who has not rid himself of the evils, both of mind and body, beginning with the gross ones, can ever expect to come by the benefits resulting from vitalization.
37. These procedures, which are laid down for prolonging life and removing old age and disease, prove effective only in the case of those who are pure in body and mind and are self-controlled.
38. No part of this knowledge should ever be imparted to those whose natures are depraved, who are free from disease, who are outside the fold of the twice-born and to those who have no eagerness to learn.
39. All vitalization procedures, all procedures of virilification and all medicine for the alleviation of disease—all this is dependent on the physician.
40. Therefore the intelligent man should revere, to the best of his, ability, the physician who is the master of life, who is wise and has mastered the Vedas, just as Indra cherishes the Ashvin Twins.
In praise of Physicians
41-45. The Ashvins who are the physicians of the gods are celebrated as the re-suscitators of Sacrifice, for it is they that reunited the severed head of Sacrifice It is these two, again, that successfully treated Pushan when his teeth had become loosened, Bhaga when he bad lost his eye-sight and Indra when his arm had become stiffened. These two, moreover, cured Soma, the moon-god, of consumption and restored him to his happiness when he had fallen from his state of good health. When Cyavana, the son of Bhrigu, had become decrepit with loss of voice and body-lustre as the result of old age, but hankered still for sense pleasures, it was the Ashvin pair that made him young once again. On account of these and many other miracles of healing, these two, the greatest of physicians, came to be regarded with honor by great personages such as Indra and others.
46-50. Cups of Soma, psalms, hymns, various kinds of burnt offerings and smoke-colored cattle are offered in sacrifice by the priests in honor of these two In the morning Indra drinks the libatory Soma along with these two in the sacrificial place.
It is again in their company that the Great God rejoices in the ‘Sautramani [sautrāmaṇī] sacrifice.’ Indra, Agni and the two Ashvins—these are the four deities that are the most commonly invoked by the priests. No gods are praised in the vedic hymns to the same extent as these four. If the Ashvin twins, by virtue of their office as healers, are thus held in honor by the very gods, including their chief, all of whom are imaging, immortal, changeless and self-controlled, what need then, is there to say, that physicians can never be honored too much by mere mortals, who are subject to death, disease and old age aud are for the most part miserable and who hunger for happiness?
51. The twice-born physician, who is endowed with character, intelligence and reason and has mistered the science of healing, deserves to be reverenced as a mentor by all men. He indeed is regarded “Life’s Guardian”.
52. On the completion of his studies, the physician is said to be ‘reborn’ and acquires the title of ‘physician.’ For no one is a physician by right of birth.
53.On the completion of his studies, the spirit of revelation or of inspiration of the truth descends into the student. It is by reason of this initiation, then, that a physician is called a ‘Dvija’ or a twice born one.
54. No thoughtful man, therefore, who seeks enduring life, should ever covet the possessions of the ‘Guardian of Life’ or revile him, or do any harm.
55. Whoever, having been treated by a physician, does not recompense him, whether or not there be a previous understanding for remuneration, that man, is beyond redemption.
Physician’s attitude towards patients
56. For his part, the physician, too, should regard all his patients as if they were his own children and vigilantly guard them from all harm, considering this to be his highest religion.
57. With the object of righteousness, wealth and sense-satisfaction, the great sages devoted to righteousness and to seeking the indestructible state, promulgated the Science of Life.
58. He who practises medicine neither for gain nor for gratification of the senses, but moved by compassion for creatures, surpasses all,
59. Those who, for the sake of a living, make merchandise of medicine, bargain for a dust-heap, letting go a heap of gold.
Physician the Life-fiver
60-61. There is no benefactor, either moral or material, comparable to that physician who regains those who are being dragged away by fierce diseases towards the abode of death, back to life, by severing the noose of death. For there is no other gift greater than the gift of life.
62. He who practises medicine, holding compassion for creatures as the highest religion, is a man who has fulfilled his mission, and attains supreme happiness.
Summary
Here are the two recapitulatory verses:—

1. Thus the first chapter on Vitalization is completed.
Woman, the best of virilifics and the Woman worthy of Approach
4-7½. The best means of stimulating, one’s manhood (the best agent of virilification), is au exhilarating sexual partner in the wife. When the desired sense-objects yield great pleasure even if singly experienced by the senses, then what need be said of the person of the woman in whom the delectable objects of all the senses are found established together. Such a combination of the delectable objects of all the senses is found only in the person of the woman and nowhere else. Indeed, it is the object that is found in the person of the woman that evokes our pleasure fully. Hence it is that man’s pleasure is mainly in the woman and that in her is established the source of progeny. In her also are established righteousness, wealth, auspiciousness and the two worlds—this and the other. The woman who is good-looking, young, endowed with auspicious physiognomic marks, and is amiable and skilled in the fine arts, acts as the best virilific.
8-15½ The qualities of beauty etc., in the woman develop suitably to the nature of the husband. They are found either as a result of their destiny or as a result of the varied tastes of people. She, who is the best of women for a man, and endears herself to him quickly by virtue of her age, form, speech and gestures either as a result of destiny or of the merits of action in this very life, who is the delight of his heart, who returns his love in equal measure, who: is akin to him in mind, who is amenable to and is pleased with his advances, who enthralls all his senses by her excellent qualities, separated from whom he feels the world to be desolate and joyless, but for whom he feels his body a burden and as if devoid of its senses, at the sight of whom he is untouched by grief, distress, depression or fear, approaching whom he gains confidence, seeing whom he gets greatly elated, whom he approaches daily with great eagerness as if for the first time, and uniting with whom in sex repeatedly he remains yet unsatisfied, such a woman, is the best of virilifics to him; and men, indeed, are of varied temperaments. The man in perfect health should approach, desiring progeny, such a woman, who is of a different clan, who is free from ill-health, who has taken her post-menstrual purificatory bath and who is cheerful and responsive.
In Dispraise of the Childless person
16-18½. The man without progeny is like a solitary tree that yields no shade, which has no branches, which bears no fruit and is devoid of any pleasant odor. The man without progeny is to be regarded as a painted lamp, a dried-up lake, or a pseudo-metal which only has the appearance of the precious metal, and is like a man of straw possessing only the shape of man. Again such a man without progeny, is regarded to be not well-established, bare, like a void, and possessed of only one sense aud as having lived a purposeless life.
19-20½. The man of numerous progeny is praised as one possessing a multiplicity of forms, faces, structures, actions, eyes, intellects and souls. Such a man is hailed as being auspicious, praiseworthy, blessed, virile and the source of many geneological branches
21-22½. Affection, strength, happiness, livelihood, expansion, numerous ness of kinsmen, fame, the happy results pertaining to all the worlds and satisfaction are all dependent upon progeny. It is, therefore, that the man desirous of progeny, the merits dependent on progeny and the pleasure of conjugal life, should always take virilifying medications.
23. We shall hereafter describe tried virilifying preparations which increase the pleasure of sexual union, virility and progeny.
The Virilific pill

This without being over-roasted over the fire, should be crushed and cast into the sweet and warm spiced meat-juice of the cock and mixed in it till the juice gets thickened; this thickened juice is virilific, tonic aud strengthening. Imbued with stallion-like vigor by its use, a man enjoys sexual intercourse with heightened virility.
41. The thickened juice of the peacock, partridge or swan in similar manner, is regarded as promoter of strength, complexion and voice. A man acquires increased virility by taking a course of these preparations. Thus has been described ‘The virilific thickened meat-juices.’
The Virilific Meat Juices
42-43, Ghee, black-gram and the testes of the goat should be cooked in the juice of buffalo flesh. It should then be strained and acidified with fruit-acids and fried in fresh ghee. It should then be mixed with a little salt, coriander, cumin seeds and dried ginger. This most excellent juice is virilifying, strengthening and roborant. Thus has been described ‘The virilifying Meat-juice of the Buffalo.’
44-45. Sparrows cooked in the meat-juice of partridge or partridge cooked in the meat juice of the cock, or the cock cooked in the meat-juice of the peacock, or the peacock cooked in the meat juice of the swan in fresh ghee, acidified with fruit acids and fried or sweetened according to one’s homologation and mixed with fragrant articles should be taken for promoting strength.

49½. One should take the juice squeezed out of the eggs of the fish, seasoned with ghee; and similarly eggs of the swan, peacock and cock should be used. Thus has been described ‘The virilifying Egg-juice.’
Purification before Virilification
Here are two verses again—
50-51. If a man takes in due dose and at proper time, the virilifying recipe, after the body-channels have been cleansed and his body has been rendered free from impurities, he thereby greatly increases his virility. The recipe also acts as a roborant and tonic. It is therefore that purification of the body must be first undertaken with due regard to the patient’s strength, for virilific preparations do not bear fruit if tried on an uncleansed constitution, even as dyes do not stick properly on an unclean cloth.
Summary
Here are the two recapitulatory verses—
52-53. The virtues of virilification, the qualities of the woman who is a proper sexual partner for a man, the disadvantages of men without progeny and the advantages of those with progeny, and the 15 preparations that promote virility and progeny as well as robustness and strength, have all been described in this quarter entitled ‘The roots of pen-reed grass.’

Virilific Fish-preparations
17-18. One who eats the fresh flesh of the Rohita fish or the Safari variety of fish, fried well in hot ghee, does not get tired in the sex-act.

Thus have been described “The virilifying fishfleshes fried in ghee.”
Virilific Pancakes
19-22. Wheat-flour mixed well with crushed flesh of fish treated with asafoetida, rock-salt and coriander should be prepared into a pan-cake and cooked in ghee. Unctuous, sour and silted fish should be cooked in the flesh-juice of the buffalo; when the juice evaporates, the flash should be crushed and black pepper, cumin seed, coriander, a little asafoetida and fresh ghee added to it; this should be stuffed within the pan-cake of black-gram. These two preparations of pan-cakes are roborant, strengthening, virilific, auspicious and promotive of progeny and semen. Thus hive been described “The two virilifying preparations of Pan-cakes.”
23-24. Reduce to powder black-gram cowage, wheat, Shali-rice, Shashtika rice, sugar, white yam and long leaved barleria. Mix this powder in thick milk and prepare pan-cakes in ghee; these taken with milk as after-draught act quickly as excellent promotives of virility. Thus have been described “The virilifying pan-cakes of black-gram etc.”
25-27. Take sugar tolas 400, cow’s ghee tolas 400, white yam tolas 64, black pepper tolas 64, bamboo manna tolas 128 and fresh honey tolas 128. All these should be mixed and placed in an earthen vessel lined with ghee. A dose of this, in keeping with one’s digestive fire, should be taken every morning. This preparation is an excellent virilific as also strengthener and roborant.
Procreant Ghee
28-29. Climbing asparagus, white yam, black-gram, cowage and small caltrops should be decocted separately in water; 64 tolas of ghee should be prepared with these decoctions individually. That ghee again should be cooked in eight times the quantity of milk. This ghee should be taken mixed with sugar and honey by one who is desirous of progeny. Thus has been described “The procreant ghee.”
Virilific Pills
30-32. Ghee tolas 256, should be cooked in hundred times its quantity of the expressed juice of white yam. This done, it should be again cooked in hundred times its quantity of cow’s milk. Then it should be mixed with 64 tolas each of sugar, bamboo manna, honey, long leaved barleria, long pepper and cowage. The physician should make pills out of this preparation of the size of a gular fig fruit.
By taking a course of these pills, a man gets stimulated and enabled to repeatedly, indulge in sex like the sparrow. Thus have been described “The virilifying pills.”
Virilific Utkarika
33-35. Sugar candy tolas 400, fresh ghee tolas 200, and honey tolas 100, should be cooked in 100 tolas of water till the whole gets thickened; then it should be kneaded into a dough along with 100 tolas of wheat flour spread upon a big, clean and smooth stone-slab; out of this, sweetmeats, round and shining bright as the moon, should be prepared. Taking a course of these, a man can quench a woman’s passion like an elephant (by the abundance of seminal discharge). Thus have been described “The Virilifying Utkarika sweetmeats.”
Other Virilities
36. Any article that is sweet, unctuous, life-promoting, roborant, heavy and pleasing to the mind is to be regarded as virilific.
37-38. Thereafter, strengthening one-self with such kinds of virilifying agents being impelled by one’s own desire, and stipulated by her attractions, one should approach his woman. After the sex-act, the man should take a bath and a draught of milk or meat juice and then go to sleeping thus, he gets replenished in his semen and strength.
39. An unblossomed bud does not possess fragrance, but obtains its scent as it blossoms; similar is the case with the semen in men.
Sex-act Contra-indicated
40. It is not proper for a man desirous of long life, to Populate with a woman when he is under sixteen or over seventy years of age.
41-42. If a young boy with his body-elements not yet fully formed copulates with a woman, he gets desiccated in no time like a pond possessing only a little water. An old man copulating with a woman crumbles down at once as a dry, sapless, worm-eaten and decayed piece of wood does, at the merest touch.
Loss of semen
43-45. The semen gets diminished by old age, anxiety, diseases, strain of labour, fasting and excessive sexual indulgence. By wasting, fear, suspicion and grief, by seeing the deformities of a woman, by the lack of response in the woman, by not bestowing thought of the subject of sex, by abstention from sex and just after full sexual enjoyment, a man is rendered incapable of mating with a woman. Virility is dependent upon physical and mental strength and the sexual urge is born of virility.
The Manner of seminal discharge
46. Just as the juice exists in the sugarcane, butter in the curds, and oil in the til, even so semen pervades the entire sentient body.
47-49. That semen trickles down during copulation between man and woman, stimulated by the warmth of the erotic act and desires, like water squeezed from a wet cloth. As a result of stimulation, desire, fluidity, viscosity, heaviness, atomicity and tendency to flow out, and the speed of the motion of vata—as a result of these eight factors, semen which is known as the formative principle of all bodies in the universe, is secreted in the body.
The Pure Semen
50. That semen which is thick, sweet, heavy, viscid, white and abundant is undoubtedly fructuous.
51. That process indeed is called virilification wherewith a man acquires equine sexual vigor and is able to copulate for long and frequently.
Summary
Here are the two recapitulatory verses—
52-53. The purpose of the exposition of virilifying preparations; the twelve most effective preparations; things that are taken before sexual intercourse and things that are taken after the intercourse; when women are not fit to be approached for sex and the thorough determination of the condition of the semen and the definition of virilification—all this, has been described here in this quarter entitled “The man of enhanced virility etc.”
2-(4). Thus in the Section on Therapeutics, in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the fourth quarter of the second chapter on ‘Virilification’, entitled “The Man of Enhanced Virility etc. [pums-jatabala]” is completed.
2. Thus the second chapter entitled “Virilification” is completed.
Synonyms of Fever
11. fever [jvara], disorder, disease, ailment and malady—all these are synonymous terms and signify the same thing.
Nature, Source etc., of Fever
12. The morbid humors, somatic and psychic, are considered to be the cause of fever. For fever [jvara] never assails a creature that is free from morbidity.
13-13½. The nature of fever is described in such terms as wasting, stupefaction, the fruit of sin and the fatal manifestation; these being the messengers of death, are so called because they are the cause of death to persons who are suffering from the evil consequences of their own actions.
14. The primogenesis of fever [jvara] is from the greed of acquisition in man and from the fierce wrath of Rudra; as declared earlier in the Section on Pathology.
15-15½. Long ago, in the second age of the world, while the great God Shiva, lay seated in meditation for a thousand celestial years, observing the yow of abstention from anger, evil minded demons to whom it was meat and drink to hinder people from their austerity, ran to him to seduce him from his austerity.
16-18. Now Daksa, the patriarch, who was aware of the mischief that these demons intended to do, chose to affect indifference. Further, the patriarch Daksha, though admonished by the gods, refrained from offering to the sovereign Shiva his inalienable share in the oblations and conducted the sacrifice by systematically omitting all praise-hymns and invocations which refer to Shiva, the lord of creatures, and which ensure the success of a sacrifice.
19-20. After the Great God had completed his vow, and come out of his meditation, he knew how Daksha had neglected his duty. Immediately the terrible one, who was master of his moods, assumed his aspect of terror and opening his third eye in the forehead, reduced those evil-doers and demons to ashes. Then, the sovereign one created out of the fire of his anger a youth that should destroy the sacrifice of Daksha.
21-25. When the sacrifice was destroyed by him, the celestials became affrighted and all living beings stricken with burning and panic, ran helter-skelter to the four quarters. Then the hosts of the celestials together with the seven sages entreated the Sovereign God with praise songs till at last the Benevolent One resumed his benevolent aspect. Knowing that now the auspicious one had regained normal mood of benevolence to all creatures, the creative that had risen out of his anger, whose weapon was ashes, who had three heads, nine eyes and was covered with a garland of flame and was terrible, short-legged and pot-bellied, seeming the very fire of wrath, having folded his hands in obeisance, said, ‘O Lord! what farther behest of thine shall I do now?’ To that embodiment of his anger, the Sovereign God vouchsafed the answer, ‘Thou shalt go down into the world of mortals as fever [jvara] and afflict life at birth and death, and in the wake of tresspasses.’
26. The effects of fever are—pyrexia, thirst accompanied by anorexia, lassitude and cardiac pain. Fever comes on as a great darkness during birth and death.
27. Thus the nature, the primogenesis and effects of fever have been described. The causes of fever, numbering eight, have been described earlier in the section on Pathology, under separate heads.
28-29. The premonitory symptoms of fever [jvara] are—lethargy, lacrimation in the eyes, yawning; heaviness, exhaustion, unsettled craving: and repugnance for heat, sun, air and water; indigestion, dysgeusia, deterioration in strength and complexion and slight change in temperament.
30.The habitat of fever is the entire body together with the mind; The periodicity of fever has been shown in the Section on Pathology.
31. The pathognomic symptom of fever is the general heating-up of body and mind. For, there is no creature affected with fever that is not afflicted with heat.
32-35. fever [jvara] is of two kinds, according as it is somatic or psychic; It is again, observed to be of two kinds, according as it is activated by the aqueous or the fiery element. It is two-fold again, according as it is internal or external in its manifestation, seasonal or unseasonal, curable or incurable. Again, fever is seen to be of five kinds, viewed in the light of the strength or weakness of the morbific factor and the season; thus, it is continuous, intermittent, quotidian, tertian and quartan. Once again, with reference to the body-elements which provide it with a habitat, fever is of seven kinds; while in view of the diversity of causes, it is of eight kinds.
36-36½. The somatic fever starts in the body first, the psychic in the mind. The psychic fever is characterised by absent-mindedness, apathy and weariness. The fever affecting the senses is known by a deterioration of their function.
37-37½. The fever [jvara] brought on by the morbid Vata and Pitta is ‘hot’ in nature and requires ‘cooling’ agents for its alleviation; while that brought on by morbid Vata and Kapha requires ‘hot’ agents for its alleviation.
38-38½. The Vata is the conducting agent par excellence. By contact it brings about both conditions; thus when charged with the fiery element, it imparts heat; when in association with the aqueous element it imparts cold.
39-40. The symptoms of internal fever should be known as excessive internal burning, excessive thirst, delirium, dyspnea, hallucination, aches in the joints and bones, and hidrosis and retention of morbid element and stools
41. The symptoms of external fever are—excessive external burning, mildness of thirst etc. and easy, curability.
41½. The seasonal fever occurring in spring and autumn is easy of cure.
42-42½. Thus the Pitta which is fiery by nature, getting aggravated by hot things flares up in the autumn. Similarly, the Kapha which has accumulated during the winter, bursts forth in the spring.
43-44½. Again the Pitta that has been nourished during the rains on water and herbs that turn acid on digestion, flares up in the autumn, being roused by the sun’s heat and precipitates fever: Such Pitta finds in Kapha its secondary support as a result of the nature of the rainy season which is characterised as the period of exudation. No danger attends the observance of the lightening therapy then. In fact this season is peculiarly suited to its practice,
45-46½. The Kapha which has been accumulating during the winter on the intake of water and herbs that turn sweet on digestion, flares up in the spring, being heated by the rays of the sun. Consequently, such Kapha gives rise to fever [jvara] in the spring. To that Kapha, during the mid-season of absorption, Vata and Pitta become associated.
47-47½. So the wise physician, having ascertained the waxing and waning strengths of the humors in the beginning, the middle and the end of Autumn and Spring, should carry out the treatment of fever [jvara].
48. A fever is adjudged seasonal if it corresponds to the characteristics of the prevailing season. Generally, the Vata-fever whenever it occurs and the other fevers occurring outside their proper seasons are considered to be difficult of cure. The various factors pertaining to such unseasonal fevers have been set out in the Section on Pathology.
49½. The fever [jvara] that is unattended with complications and seen to occur in constitutions that are strong but slightly vitiated is easy of cure.
Signs of Curability and incurability
50-50½. Whereas the fever that is brought about by many and powerful factors and is characterised by many symptoms and is rapidly destructive of the sense faculties, is to be regarded as fatal.
51-51½. The acute fever attended with raving giddiness and dyspnea, will kill its victim in seven, ten or twelve days.
52-52½. The fever [jvara] that occurs in the emaciated or in the edematous and that which is deep-seated, chronic and virulent and which causes the partings in the hair, should be regarded as incurable
Continuous Fever
53-53½. The accumulated morbid humors that are carried by the channels of the nutrient fluid, permeate the whole body and thereafter getting localised, give rise to the continuous fever.
54-54½. The continuous fever lasts for either seven, ten or twelve days and is most unbearable. Being rapid in its course, it either soon kills its victim or soon abates.
55-55½. It is the morbid humor that is homologous to the prevailing season, to the seat of morbidity and to the patient s habitus, unchecked by any hostile factor that gives rise to the continuous fever. It should be known that it is on account of this that, this fever [jvara] is so difficult to bear.
56-56½. In the continuous fever, the morbid humors—Vata etc., invariably and at one and the same time affect the body-elements as well as the feces and urine.
57-57½. The continuous fever kills or leaves the patient according as the body-elements, viz., the nutrient fluid and others become thouroughly pure or remain impure at the end of the week etc
58-60½. Sometimes even when the aforesaid twelve fever-habitats have not become pure either perfectly or throughout the body, the continuous fever may come down on the twelfth day, but lying dormant in the body will dog the patient for long proving intractable to treatment. Knowing this, the physician should begin treating the continuous fever promptly with the procedures of depletive therapy.
Remittent Fever
61-62. The morbid toxic factors residing mainly in the blood, having opposition from the anti-bodies, cause remittent fever which periodically rising and remitting has two phases of rise of fever in one day.
63-63½. The toxic factors occluding the fat-carrying channels, being strengthened by any one of the factors viz, season and habitus of the patient and susceptibility of bodyelements, cause fever which rises only once in the whole day.
64. The tertian and quartan fevers are caused by toxic factors residing in the bone and marrow.
65-66. The physicians of another medical school hold a different view on this matter. They say that the toxic matter lying in the blood may also give rise to quotidian fever, that the toxic matter lying in the flesh and body-channels may also cause, tertian fever and that lying in the path of the adipose tissue may also cause quartan fever.
67. The quotidian fever recurs every day, the tertian fever with an interval of a day, and that is quartan fever which recurs: with an intervals of two days.
68. Just as the seed lies dormant in the soil and germinates iu season, in the same manner the toxic matter lies quiescent in the body-element and flares Up when the time is ripe.
69. Thus the morbific factor gathering strength and biding the propitious time manifests itself as the tertian or the quartan fever as soon as the disease-resisting power in the body is lowered.
70. In this manner, the disease-generating factors, having worked themselves out, lapse into quiescence and retire to their respective stations in the body; then, mustering up their strength once again, these toxic elements afflict the patient with fever at their own ripe times.
71. The tertian fever is of three varieties. Thus, if induced by excess of Kapha and Pitta, it afflicts the lumbar region; if of the nature of Vata and Kapha, it afflicts the back; and if of Vata and Pitta, it causes the head-ache
72. The quartan fever presents two kinds of effects. If characterised by Kapha, it causes pain in the shanks first and if induced by Vata, it first assails the head.
73. There is another kind of irregular fever which is none other than the quartan fever reversed. It is brought on by any one of the three morbid humors residing in the two body-elements (bone and bone-marrow).
74. All these five types of fevers are generally seen to result from tridiscordance of humors. Each fever is named after the particularly predominant humor.
Fever in relation to Season etc.
75. It is to the strength or weakness of season, day, night and the morbid humors, as well as of the mind, and in pursuance of the effects of past actions, that a given fever owes its periodicity.
76. Of the fever [jvara] that has its habitat in the body-nutrient fluid; the following are the symptoms: heaviness, depression of spirits, anxiety, asthenia, vomiting, anorexia, external burning, lassitude and fits of yawning.
77. Of the fever with its habitat in the blood, the following are the symptoms: red and hot rashes, thirst, the frequent spitting of blood, burning, redness, giddiness, intoxication and raving.
78. Of the fever with its habitat in the flesh, the following are. the symptoms: internal burning, thirst, stupefaction, depression, looseness of stools, fetor and convulsion of limbs.
79. Of the fever with. its habitat in the fat, the following are the symtoms: perspiration, violent thirst, raving, frequent vomiting, disgust for one’s own body-odor, depression and anorexia.
80. Of the fever that has gone down to the bones, the following are the symptoms—combined fits of vomiting and purging, the feeling as if the bones have been broken, groaning, convulsion of the limbs and dyspnea.
81.Of the fever [jvara] with its habitat in the bone-marrow, the following are the symptoms—hiccup, dyspnea, cough, extreme faintness, feeling as though the vital parts had been cleft asunder, external chilliness and internal burning.
82. If fever, capable of pervading everywhere has penetrated to the secretory element in the body, then causing the expulsion of vital secretions and destroying the life-breaths, it departs together with the elements of air, fire and water in the body.
83. The fever, that cleaves to the body-nutrient fluid and the blood, is curable; so also the fever that cleaves to the fat and the flesh elements; while the fever that attacks the bone and the bone-marrow is difficult of cure. As regards the fever that has penetrated the secretory element, it does not admit of cure.
84. Of the eight varieties of fever [jvara] which were described earlier in the Section on Pathology with reference to their causes and symptoms, listen now to a fuller description of what was then referred to in brief, viz., the fevers arising from the discordance of two humors.
85-851. Of the fever arising from, the discordance of Vata and Pitta,.the symptoms are—head-ache, breaking pain in the joints, burning, horripilation, dryness of the throat and mouth, vomiting, thirst, fainting, giddiness, anorexia, insomnia, excessive talk and yawning.
86-87. Of the fever arising from Vata and Kapha, the following are the symptoms—chilliness, heaviness, torpor, rigidity, breaking pain in the joints, head-ache, coryza, cough, anhidrosis and moderate temperature.
88-88¾. Of the fever arising from the discordance of Kapha and Pitta; the following are the symptoms—frequent stoppage of perspiration, stupefaction, cough, anorexia, thirst, discharge of phlegm and bile, furred condition and bitter taste of the mouth and somnolence. Thus the fevers born of the bi-discordance have been described.
Thirteen types of tridiscordant fever
89-90. The fever born of the tridiscordance will now be described. From now onward we shall describe the individual symptoms of each of the thirteen varieties of fever arising from the triple or total discordance, which varieties were out-lined earlier in the Section on General Principles.
91.In the fever arising from the condition of the tridiscordance wherein the Vata and Pitta show severe, and kapha moderate aggravation, the symptoms are:—giddiness, thirst, burning, heaviness and severe head-ache.
92. In the fever [jvara] wherein the discordance of the Vata and Kapha is severe and that of the Pitta less marked, the symptoms observed are—chilliness, cough, anorexia, torpor, thirst, burning, aches and pain.
93. In the fever wherein the discordance of the Pitta and the Kapha is severe and that of Vata moderate, the symptoms observed are—vomiting, chilliness, alternating fits of burning, thirst, stupefaction and aches in the bones.
94. In the fever wherein the discordance of the Vata is great and that of the other two factors less marked, the symptoms observed are—piercing pains in the joints, bones and the head, raving, heaviness, giddiness, thirst and dryness of the throat and mouth.
95. In the fever of the triple discordance wherein the Pitta is comparatively severe, the symptoms observed are—sticky stools and urine, burning, perspiration, thirst, decline of strength and fainting.
96. In the fever of the tridiscordance wherein the Kapha is more provoked thau the rest, the following should be known as the symptoms—weariness, anorexia, nausea, burning, vomiting, apathy, giddiness, torpor and cough.
97. In the fever wherein the discordance of Kapha is severe, of Pitta moderate and of Vata slight, the following are considered to be the symptoms—coryza, vomiting, weariness, torpor, anorexia and dullness of the gastric fire
98. In the fever [jvara] wherein the discordance of Pitta is great, of Kapha moderate and of Vata slight, the symptoms are considered to be yellowish urine and eyes, burning, thirst, giddiness and anorexia.
99. In the fever wherein the discordance of Vata is great, of Kapha moderate, and of Pitta slight, the following are the symptoms—headache, tremors, dyspnea, raving, vomiting and anorexia
100. In the fever wherein the discordance of Kapha is great, of Vata moderate and of Pitta slight, the following are known to be the symptoms ' chilliness, heaviness, torpor, raving and severe pain in head and bones.
101. In the fever wherein the discordance of the Vata is great, of the Pitta moderate, and of the Kapha slight, the following are considered to be the symptoms -dyspnea, cough, coryza, dryness of the mouth and severe pain iu the sides.
102. In the fever [jvara] wherein the discordance of the Pitta is great, of the Vata is moderate and of the Kapha slight, the following symptoms are observed—loose stools, weakness of the gastric fire, thirst, burning, anorexia and giddiness.
103-108½. We shall now describe the characteristics of fever wherein the discordance of the three humors is equally severe. Sudden alternation of burning and cold, aches in the bones, joints and the head; eyes watering, dull, injected with blood and twisted awry; pain and buzzing noise in the ears; sensation in the throat as if pricked on all sides by thorns; torpor, stupefaction, raving, cough, dyspnea, anorexia, giddiness, tongue scorched as though by fire and rough to the touch; utter lassitude of the limbs, spitting of blood or bile mixed with phlegm, restless tossing of the head, thirst, loss of sleep, pain in the chest, delayed and scanty discharge of perspiration, urine and stools, slight emaciation of the limbs, continuous stertorous sounds in the throat, emergence of circular wheals or rashes of dark-red color, inaudibility of voice, inflammation of the body channels, heaviness of the stomach and delayed maturing of the morbid humors—these are the manifestations of the fever of tridiscordance type.
109-109½. The fever [jvara] born of tridiscordance, if marked by the retention of impurities and loss of the dgestive fire and attended with all its symptoms, is impossible of cure. If otherwise, it may, with difficulty, be brought under control,
110-110½. The three-fold division of fever arising from the discordance, of one or the other of the humors has been delineated in the Section on. Pathology, in view of which have also been described, in greater detail, the pathognomic symptoms of the fevers born of tri and bi discordances of the humors.
Varieties of Exogenous fever
111-11½. The eighth variety of fever, which arises from external factors, is classified into four kinds. Thus, the exogenous fever is brought on by trauma, possession by evil spirits, black magic and imprecation.
112-112½. The traumatic fever is that which occurs as the result of the body being injured by weapons, brick-bats, whips, sticks, clenched fists palms of the hands, teeth or by such other external agencies.
113- 113½. In the traumatic fever, it is the Vata, that generally vitiating the blood, gives rise to the fever accompanied with aches and pain, swelling and change of color.
114-114½. That variety of fever which is seen in persons who are possessed with desire, grief, fear or auger as well as that which appears in persons who are seized by the spirits, is to be known as fever born of ‘possession’.
115-116. If the invasion is by desire, grief or fear, it is the Vata that gets provoked; if by anger, it is the Pitta and if by the genii it is any of the three humors corresponding to the nature of the particular genius. This last, evincing eight kinds of characteristics has been fully described in the topic dealing with spirit-possession.
117. Some physicians belonging to another school of thought maintain that even that fever which is seen in a person suffering from the effects of contact with poisonous plants, of air or frith other poisonous things, is also another variety of possession fever.
118-119. Accordingly, in their opinion, a patient afflicted with this kind of fever [jvara] obtains relief by treatment with antidotes. That fever which is induced by black-magic or imprecation by Siddhas is characterised by the discordance of all the three humors, is very severe in nature and is most unbearable.
120-121½. It should, however be distinguished from other fevers coming under this categories of triple discordance by noting the precise character of the pain afflicting the mind, the senses and the body as well as diverse other symptoms of ill-being evinced by the patient, by personal experience of the modus operands of black magic and curse, by what one has heard, from authoritative sources concerning such things and also by the method of inference drawn from the application of therapeutic tests. Since black magic and imprecation are of diverse modes, the fevers resulting from their employment are also diverse and are distinguished by symptoms corresponding to the particular mode.
122-123½. In the fever [jvara] of desire the symptom is obsession with constant sighing; the fever born of grief is marked by constant lachrymation; the fever born of fear by constant dread; the fever born of anger by much exasperation; the fever resulting from spirit-possession by super-human
behaviour and the fever born of poisoning by much fainting, stupefaction, intoxication and depression.
124-124½. In some patients afflicted with the fever due to desire and the rest, the rise of temperature precedes the other symptoms; in some others the rise of temperature follows the other symptoms; while in some the rise of temperature and other symptoms appear simultaneously.
125-125½. Some again of the symptoms which have been assigned to this or that in this relation of fevers beginning with that born of desire, are also seen in connection with other diseases born of same cause.
126-126½. Even after the mind has become afflicted with desire etc., the fever does not become virulent so long as the body is free from vitiation by the morbific humors, Vata etc.
127-127½. And conversely, so long as the mind is unvitiated by desire etc., the fever fails to gather strength even if the body has been assailed by the morbific humors.
128-128½. These exogenous fevers are, at the onset, marked only by their own specific symptoms; thereafter they develop other and mixed symptoms. Moreover, all these fevers, being exogenous, differ from the other endogenous types of fevers, as regards both their causation and medication.
The onset of fever [jvara]
129-131½. The humors getting provoked, either singly, dually or totally (i. e- the three of them) invade first the body-element called the ‘Rasa,’ the body-nutrient fluid, and displacing the gastric fire, augment the normal heat of the body by their own morbid heat conjoined with the heat of the displaced gastric fire; and thereafter obstructing the body-channels, finally run riot through the whole body, thus engendering excessive heat in the body. As the result, the patient, at this time, becomes exceedingly heated in all the parts of his body, and is consequently spoken of as being fevered.
Anidrosis in Fever
132-132½. On account of the body-channels being obstructed and the gastric fire displaced, the sweat does not generally emerge to the skin-surface during the early stage of the fever.
Chyme Fever etc.
133-135½. The following are the symptoms of this immature stage of fever—-anorexia, indigestion, heaviness in the abdomen, congested condition of the chest, torpor, lassitude, high unremitting fever, stoppage of the. excretory functions, salivation, nausea, loss of hunger, bad taste in the mouth, stiffness, numbness and heaviness of the limbs, excessive micturition, undigested stools and absence of emaciation.
136-136½. Of the fever [jvara] in the maturing stage, the symptoms are—greater, intensity of the fever, thirsty raving, dyspnea, giddiness, resumption of the excretory, functions and nausea,
137-137½. Of the phase of fever that has become fully, matured; the symptoms are—return of hunger, emaciation, lightness of limbs, mildness of fever, restoration of the excretory functions as also the lapse of eight days from the onset.
Contra-indications in Early stage of Fever
138-138½. In the early stage of the fever, the patient should avoid, day-sleep, bath, inunction, food, sex-act, anger, draughts, exercise and astringent articles.
Lightening-therapy advised
139-139½. Lightening, therapy is advised in the beginning of the fever except in fevers due to wasting, Vata, fear, anger, desire, grief and fatigue.
140-140½. The morbid matter being diminished and the gastric fire being re-activated by this lightening therapy, there will return to the patient freedom from fever, lightness off body and hunger.
141-141½. The lightening therapy, however, should not be pushed to the extent of imparing the patient’s vitality as health is dependent on vitality; and it is for the sake of health that all treatment is meant.
142-142½. In the early stage of fever [jvara], starvation, sudation, time-effect, diet of gruels and articles of bitter taste, digest the imperfectly digested morbid matter in the body.
143-144½. When the patient feels thirsty, he should be given warm water to drink if the fever is of the Vata-cum-Kapha type; and if the fever is due to alcoholism or Pitta, he should be given potions of water prepared with bitter decoctives and well-cooled Both types of drink are gastric-stimulant, digestive, febrifuge, purificatory of the body-channels, strength-giving, appetising, diaphoretic and generally beneficial.
145-145½. For the relief of thirst and fever, the patient may be given a cooled beverage which has been prepared by decocting nut-grass, trailing rungia, cuscus grass, sandal-wood, fragrant sticky mallow and dry ginger.
146-146½. The physician, recognising that the fever-causing morbid humors are predominant with Kapha and are lodged in the stomach, and have been precipitated and that the patient is fit to undergo emesis, should eliminate the morbid matter by emetics at the proper time.
147-147½. If emesis is. performed in the very early stage of fever [jvara], when the morbid elements have not been precipitated, there will often occur cardiac disorder, dyspnea, constipation and fainting.
148-148½. Because the morbid matter has pervaded the whole body and is immature and lodged in all the body-elements and is difficult to remove, its premature removal is attended with danger to life or with complications, and may be likened to the forceful expression of. juice from an unripe fruit,
Use of Gruels in fever [jvara]
149-150½. After starvation and emesis have been gone through, the patient should be given at the proper time. gruels prepared with suitable medications, using thin gruels in the beginning. The wise physician should give these gruels till the fever [jvara] becomes mild or for a period of six days. By this, the digestive power of the patient becomes stimulated, like fire by fuel.
151-153½. These gruels, being medicated and light in nature, are stimulative of gastric fire and regulate the passage of flatus, urine, feces and morbid matter moving downwards. Being liquid and hot, they act as diaphoretic[?] being liquid they relieve thirst; being, nutritive, they increase, the vitality; being of a flowing nature, they lead to the lightness of body; and being wholesome in fever, they act as febrifuge. Therefore, the wise physician should treat the fever-patient with gruels from the very beginning, except in cases where the fever is due to alcoholism.
154-154½. In morbid intoxication, in summer and in conditions of Pitta-cum-Kapha as well as. in hemothermia affecting the upper part of the body, gruels are not wholesome.
155-155½. In such fevers, the mulcent drinks prepared of roasted paddy flour should be given in the beginning, mixed, with fever-curing fruit-juices, honey and sugar
156-156½. The. physician, keeping in view the homologation and vitality of the patient, should, after the demulcent drink has been digested, put the patient on a diet of thin soup of green gram or the meat-juice of jangala creatures.
157-157½. At the meal-time, he should be directed, to clean his teeth, with tooth-twigs which are of antagonistic taste to the taste in the mouth and which is liked by the patient.
158-158½. This teeth-cleansing will produce clearness of the mouth, desire for food and drink, and increase the relish for tastes.
159-159½. Having cleansed the mouth with the ends of twigs of trees and having gargled the mouth frequently with whey, sugar-cane juice and wine etc., he should take proper diet.
Decoctions in Fever
160-160½. When six days have passed, the physician should give the fever-patient digestive or sedative decoction and light diet at every meal.
Contra-indication of astringent taste in early stage
161-161½. The morbid matter which is fixed in the early stage of fever becomes more fixed and is not digested by astringent decoctives due to astringent action and they cause irregular fever.
162-162½. The prohibition laid down here against the use of ‘Kashaya’ is not with reference to its technical meaning in pharmaceutics but it is with reference to its technical meaning relating to its property of astringency. In other words, decoctives of astringent taste or action are alone prohibited in the early stage of fever.
Use of Soups
163-163½. For a period of ten days the patient should live on a diet of light food mixed with acid or non-acid soups or wholesome flesh-juice of jangala animals, for the relief of fever.
Use of ghee
164-164½. Thereafter, if the Kapha is mild, and Vata and Pitta are in excess and the morbid matter has all been fully digested, the potion of ghee acts like ambrosia in fever.
Use of meat-juice
165-166½. Knowing that ten days have passed and still Kapha is found to be in excess, or that the patient has not undergone starvation, the physician should not give him ghee but treat him with decoctives- Till the lightness of body is induced, he should be given light food mixed with meat-juices. This contributes to the natural vitality and natural vitality is sufficient to subdue the morbid humors.
Use of milk
167-167½. The condition of fever with Vata and Pitta in excess, occurring in a patient afflicted with burning aud thirst, where there is alternate constipation and diarrhea and which is free from undigested matter, may be subdued by treatment with milk.
Use of Purgation
168-168½. If the fever is not subdued by this line of treatment, it should be allayed by purgative aud emetic procedures provided the patient’s strength, flesh and digestive power are not diminished.
Evacuative Enema
169-169½. Purgation or emesis is not advisable in the case of a patient emaciated with fever. It is better to eliminate the morbid matter in such a patient by a course of milk or by evacuative enema,
170-70½. Evacuative enema if given when the morbid matter has been fully digested will immediately increase the vitality and digestive power, and produce apyrexia, good cheer and appetite.
171-171½. Laxation will eliminate. Pitta or Kapha-Pitta lodged in the habitat or the Pitta, while enemata will eliminate all the three kinds of morbid matter lodged in the colon.
Unctuous Enema
172-172½. Unctuous enema should be given in chronic fever in conditions where the Kapha and Pitta have diminished, the digestive fire is strong and the stools are dry and constipated.
Errhines
173-173½. Agreeable errhine medications should be given in heaviness of the head, headache, and impairment of the sense-functions occurring in chronic fevers.
174-174½. The physician having ascertained whether heat or cold is the causative factor of the chronic fever, should administer suitable inunctions and applications, affusions and baths.
175-175½. By this means, the fever [jvara] which has remained only in the peripheral parts is soon removed, the body restored to ease, and vitality and complexion are enhanced.
176-176½. The chronic fever whose residual effects are left only in the skin, get allayed by fumigation and collyrium procedures; so also the fever which is induced by external causes like spirit possession.
177. Thus, we have described the effective line of treatment for the cure of fever.
177½. We shall now describs the articles required in these procedures, in their due order,
178-178½. In the preparations of gruels, cooked rice and roasted paddy, old red Shali and other kinds of rice and also Shashtika rice are recommended for administration to the [fe??? at??? are curative of fever]
179-180½. The fever-patient whose digestive fire is weak, should take in the beginning, when hungry, thin gruel and roasted paddy prepared with long pepper and dry ginger. This gruel is easily digested If the patient wishes for acid taste, this gruel may be prepared with sour pomegranates, and dry ginger. If the patient is suffering from diarrhea or is of the pitta habitus, he may take it well cooled and mixed with honey.
181-181½. If the fever-patient is suffering from pain in the side of the chest and hypogastric region or in the head, he should take the fevercuring thin gruel of red rice prepared with small caltrops and yellow-berried nightshade.
182-182½. If the fever-patient is suffering from diarrhea, he may take the gruel prepared with painted-leaved uraria, heart-leaved sida, bael, dry ginger, blue lotus and coriander, mixed with sour article.

259. Affusions and immersions with honey, sour conjee, milk, curds, ghee and water alleviate immediately fever accompanied with burning, by virtue of their cooling effects.
Here are verses again—
260-261.

267-(4). With this oil in genially warm condition, the fever-patient, desirous of warm measures, may be anointed; thus the algid fever gets cured,
267. Also an application with the fine paste made of the above drugs in genially warm condition should be done and the decoction of these should be used for bath and affusion, for the cure of algid fever. Thus has been described ‘The Compound Eagle-wood oil.’
Here are verses again—
268.The thirteen varieties of sudation-procedure, which have been described in the chapter on sudation, applied by the physician, skilled in the knowledge of dosage and time, are curative of algid fever
The hot cabin-sudation, the bed and the coverings related to it and thick smoke from eaglewood, soon allay the algid fever
270. The warm embraces of youthful women with comely and rounded limbs, allay the fever accompanied with chill.
271. Foods and drinks that are sudorific and curative of Vata and Kapha, administered to suit the predominance of Vata or Kapha in this condition of bi-discordance soonsubdue algid fever.
Fasting contra indicated in certain Fevers
272. Lightening procedure is not advisable in fever due to Vata, fatigue and pectoral lesions and in chronic fever. These conditions should be treated with sedative measures.
273. Since the morbid humors, expelling the gastric heat from its natural habitat and carrying it to the nutrient fluid of the body, cause pyrexia, so, naturally, the strength of the gastric fire is diminished.
274-275. Just as a fire, though well enkindled and fuelled, fails to cook the rice well in the cooking pot if its flames are deflected by the wind, in the same manner, the gastric heat being expelled from its natural habitat in the body by the morbid humors, is either unable to digest the ingested food or will digest even light foods with difficulty.
276-276½. Hence the lightening therapy and similar other procedures are beneficial for preserving the strength of the gastric fire. In seven days the toxic matter, which has spread to all the seven body-elements gets digested and hence on the eighth day, the fever [jvara] is generally said to be free from all toxic quality.
277-277½. If the patient in whom the morbid matter has been precipitated and whose digestive power is weak, takes specially heavy diet, he is either suddenly deprived of life or becomes afflicted for a long period.
278-278½. Owing to this consideration, the wise physician should not give his patient, all at once, very heavy or very unctuous diet in the early stage of fever arising even from Vata.
279-279½. In the early stage of fever due to V ata, if there are no complications, as sequela, inunction and similar other procedures may be given, even without adherence to the order relating to these procedures.
280-280½. Thus, the patient should be given a dose of decoction to drink, followed by a diet of meat-juice. All the procedures of treatment curative of chronic fever, should be applied.
Treatment in Fever not ripened even after a week
281-281½. The fever [jvara], occurring in persons of Kapha-habitus, afflicted with only slight Vata and weak thermal quality as a result of Kapha, being deficient in heat and excessive in the aqueous element, does not become fully mature even after the lapse of seven days.
282-282½. Having treated this type of fever for ten days by the aforesaid lightening therapy, restricted diet and similar methods of treatment, the physician should further treat the patient with fever-curing dec actions etc.
283-283½. In patients suffering from fever due to undigested toxic matter, or from fever due to Kapha or from fever arising from Kapha-cum-pitta, the various procedures of lightening therapy as may be found suitable in each case, should be administered.
284-284½. The wise physician should treat fevers due to Kapha, Pitta and Vata, with emesis, purgation and enemata respectively.
285-285½. The physician skilled in the knowledge of the order of humoral discordance, should, having ascertained. by differential diagnosis, the precise state of the morbidity of the humors, i.e whether the severity of discordance of the three humors is equal, graded or uneven, should subdue the fevers, arising from both bidiscordance and tri-discordance, by means of therapeutic measures that have been duly described.
286-286½. The fever [jvara] of tri-discordance may be subdued either by aggravating one of the humors and eliminating the aggravated one, or by beginning to treat the habitat of Kapha first.
Treatment of swelling at the root of the ear
287-287½. In the final stage of the fever due to tri-discordance, there occurs an acute swelling at the root of the ear, from which few recover.
288-288½. This should be subdued immediately by blood-letting and potion of ghee as well as external applications; nasal medications and gargles, all curative of Kapha and Pitta.
289-289½. The fever [jvara] which is not alleviated either by heat or cold, by unctuous or non-unctuous treatment, is the fever of The peripheral Type. It is relieved by blood-letting.
290-290½. If the fever is due to acute spreading affection, trauma or eruption, provided it is not associated with Pitta and Kapha, it should be treated in the beginning with potion of ghee.
Treatment in Chronic Fever
291-291½, Chronic fevers continue on account of weakness of the body-elements. Hence, this should be treated by strength-giving and roborant articles of diet.
292-292½. The tertian and quartan fevers are subdued by an inclusive line of treatment, that is, medications in conjunction with propitiatory offerings and the like, connected with rites invoking supernatural intervention; for, generally in the irregular fevers, there is seen the concomitant factor of spirit possession.
293-293½. The physician should allay the irregular fever where Vata is predominant, by potion of ghee, evacuative and unctuous enemata and foods and drinks of unctuous and hot articles
294-294½. The physician should subdue the irregular fever where Pitta is predominant by purgation, milk and medicated ghee and bitter and cooling articles.
295-295½. The physician should treat the irregular fever where Kapha is predominant by emesis, digestives non-unctuous articles of food and drink, lightening procedures and hot decoctions.
296-296½. Now, we shall describe some celebrated recipes curative of irregular fever. The intelligent physician should, after making a differential diagnosis of the morbid humors, make use of these recipes.
297-297½. As drink, the patient should be given the Sura wine with its supernatent fluid, and as diet, he should be given the meat of cocks, partridges and peacocks.
298-298½. Or, the patient may drink he Shatpala medicated ghee or a [?course] of chebulic myrobalans or he decoction of the three myrobalans or the juice of guduch.
299-299½. At the time when the fever [jvara] is expected to recur, the patient, having been prepared by procedures of oleation and sudation, may be made to drink in due manner, the decoctions of indigo, wild carrot, turpeth and kurroa.
300-300½. Or, he must be made to vomit again by means of a large dose of ghee or by causing him to consume [?] surfeit of food and drink.
301-301½. Or, at the time when he fever is to recur, the patient may, having consumed his fill of wine together with food, sleep away the period of attack, or corrective or alleviative enema should be administered in irregular fever.
302-302½. He should take, on that day, a draught of cat’s dung mixed with milk, or bull’s dung and rocksalt mixed with whey or Sura wine.
303-303½. In irregular fever, he should take the powder of long pepper, the three myrobalans, curds, butter-milk, ghee, or a mixture of the five products of the cow viz., curds, milk, ghee, dung and urine, or milk alone.
304-304½. The eating of garlic with oil before meals is also recommended, as also of such meats as. are fatty and hot in potency.
305-305½. Asafetida and tiger’s fat in equal proportions should be mixed with rock-salt and taken as a nasal medication. Similarly old ghee aud lion’s fat, mixed with rock salt, may be used.
306-306½. An eye-salve, consisting of rock-salt and grains of long pepper, and red arsenic mixed with til oil and reduced to paste is recommended, in irregular fever.
307-307½. Fumigation with the powders of gum guggul, neem leaves, sweet flag, costus, chebulic myrobalan, rape seeds and common barley, mixed in ghee, are alleviative of irregular fever.
308-308½. All these smokes, fumigations, nasal medications and, eye-salves, which have been indicated in. mental disorders, may also be used in, irregular fever.
309-309½. Moreover, by wearing auspicious stones, herbs and certain poisons and by the use of prophylactic medicines, one secures immunity to attacks of fever.
310-310½. By worshipping with due piety, the god Ishvara [Īśvara] together with his consort Uma [Umā], waited on by the god’s entourage and the company of the ‘Mothers’—(minor goddesses), one soon gets rid of the irregular fever.
311-311½. By worshipping Vishnu [Viṣṇu], the myriad-headed, the lord of all that is animate and inanimate, and the all-pervading, with the recital of his thousand names, one throws off fever of any kind.
312-312½. By worship through sacrifices, the gods—Brahma [Brahmā], the two Ashvins [Aśvins]; Indra, Agni, Himalaya, Ganga [Gaṅgā] and the company of the Maruts, one conquers fever.
313-314½. By tending one’s father and mother and elders with devotion, by observance of celibacy, austerity, truth-telling and vows, by the repetition of prayers and the performance of sacrifices and charities, by listening to the recitation of the Vedas and by seeing holy people, one soon gets cured of fever.
315-316½. If the toxic element of fever is lodged in the body-nutrient fluid, the procedures of emesis and starvation should be administered; if the toxic element is lodged in the blood, affusion and external applications, as also sedative procedures, are indicated; if it is lodged in the flesh or fat, purgation in conjunction with starvation is beneficial; and if the toxic element has gone down to the bone or bone-marrow, evacuative and unctuous enemata should be given.
317-317½. In the fevers [jvara] that are produced by imprecation and black magic or by possession, all therapeutic procedures that invoke divine intervention are beneficial.
318-319. The traumatic fever is allayed by potions and inunctions of ghee, by bloodletting and by the use of such wines, meat-juices and cooked rice as are homologous to the patient. The traumatic fever, accompanied with constipation, occurring in those who are accustomed to wine-drinking, subsides by the use of food and meat-juice, along with wine.
320-320½. The fever, resuming from pectoral lesions or wounds, subsides by the treatment described in the chapter on ‘pectoral lesions and wounds’. The fevers induced by desire, grief and fear are allayed by comforting the patient by giving him what he wants, by quieting the irritated Vata, and by stimulating him to pleasure.
321-321½. The fever arising from auger is put to rest by surrounding the patient with desirable and pleasing objects, by treating him with measures curative of Pitta and by giving him good counsel.
322-322½. The fever born of anger is quieted by desire, and that born of desire is quieted by auger, and by means of both these, the fevers born of fear and grief are quieted.
323-323½. As regards the patient who by constant pre-occupation with the severity and the period of the next attack, brings the fever on himself despite treatment, he should be weaned out of his obsession by engagement of his attention with agreeable and interesting objects.
Signs of the Abatement of fever [jvara]
324-326. When the fever is about to come down with a crisis, the patient while groaning vomits, fidgets about, pants, grows livid, gets drenched with perspiration, shivers and faints frequently. He talks incoherently; all his limbs burn hot, or become very cold. He loses consciousness wrecked by the intensity of the fever, and glares as if in anger. The stools that contain morbid matter and are watery, are expelled violently and with noise. The wise physician should know these as the symptoms of the crisis of fever during its stage of defervescence.
327. These acute symptoms are, however, commonly observed only in cases of new and virulent fevers afflicting a person in whom there is already great morbidity and when they are made to defervesce violently by means of procedures which precipitate the ripening of the morbid humors.
328. As regards chronic fevers which wear themselves out gradually, having exhausted their fury along with the accumulation of morbid humors, their defervescence is marked by mild symptoms i.e. lysis.
329. That man should be regarded as completely cured of fever who shows no signs of exhaustion and temperature, is free from distress, has his senses functioning soundly, and is in possession of his normal mental strength.
Contra-indication in Fever and Treatment in Relapse
330-331. The fever-patient, as well as the fever-convalescent, should avoid indulging in articles of food and drink that are irritant, heavy, disagreeable and antagonistic. They should also avoid sex-congress, immoderate exertion, baths and over-eating. As a result of such self-denial, fever subsides and having subsided, does not recur.
332. The fever-convalescent should not indulge iu exercise or sex activity, baths and.movements, so long as he has not recovered his normal strength.
Causes for Relapse of Fever
333.If the fever-convalescent while yet unrestored to strength, takes to these forbidden activities, the fever relapses.
334. If, similarly, the fever has left without exhausting the intensity of morbid humors, then too, a relapse may be occasioned by even slight indiscretions,
335. And thus revisiting the patient who has been long plagued by it and has constantly grown debilitated in body and diminished in lustre, the fever [jvara] finishes him off in no great time.
336. And if the toxins get gradually absorbed into the body-element without actually giving rise to fever, even so, they harm the body in other ways.
337. They produce such disorders as depression of the spirits, edema, exhaustion, anemia, inappetence, pruritus, wheals, pimples and dullness of gastric lire.
338-339. Similarly, in consequence of the toxic element not being totally expelled, other diseases too, having abated, recur on the slightest provocation due to unwholesome diet etc In view of this, the physician should not be contented with the subsidence of the fever, but see that the toxic elements are either completely expelled or neutralised by therapeutic procedures, keeping in view the age, the strength and vitality of the patient.
Treatment in Relapse
340-341. The following measures are beneficial in relapsed fever: application of mild cleansing procedures, the administration of alleviative enemata, wholesome and light gruels, the meatjuices of the Jangala animals, inunctions, dry massage, baths, fumigation, eye-salves and ghee medicated with bitter drugs.
342. If the relapse of the fever [jvara] is due to taking heavy, demulcent and disagreeing foods, then as before, lightening procedure and hot remedies etc., should be administered.
343. The regular use of chiretta, kurroa, nut-grass, trailing rungia and guduch eradicates the fever that keeps recurring.
344. The discerning physician should, keeping in view the systematic procedure of treatment, apply such therapeutic measures as may be called for, from time to time, by the changing conditions of the fever-patient.
345. Since fever [jvara] is the king of diseases, the destroyer of all creatures and pitiless, the physician should be specially diligent in its subjugation.
Summary
Here is the recapitulatory verse—
346. The treatment of fever has thus been described in due order and in answer to the questions, unto Agnivesha by Atreya, for the welfare of all creatures.
3. Thus, in the Section on Therapeutics in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the third chapter entitled, ‘The Therapeutics of Fever [jvara-cikitsa]’ is completed.
Urgency of Treatment
5. The master declared, ‘The physician versed in the knowledge of the causes and symptoms, should be prompt in the treatment of hemothermia which is a very serious and acute disease and develops very rapidly like fire.
Etiology of hemothermia [raktapitta]
6. Its causes have already been narrated as the excessive use of hot, acute, acid, pungent and salt articles qf diet, heat and misdigestion of food.
7. The Pitta precipitated by these causes reaches the blood and thus reaching what is its own source, increases there and vitiates the blood.
8. As a result of its heat, the body-elements melt one after the other and ooze out; and thus due to this process of liquefaction of bodyelements, its proportion in the body becomes greatly increased.
9. The wise call this disorder of the thermic element ‘Hemothermia,’
[? cause of?] of the combination with and [???] of the blood or ‘Hemo’ by the hermic element; and also owing to its similarity. in color and smell to the blood.
The site of hemothermia [raktapitta]
10.The spleen and the liver are the seats of affection and they are the sources of the blood-bearing channels of the human body.
11-12½. In Hemothermia [raktapitta], the blood is thick, pale, unctuous, and [???tions] where Kapha is [???nant]. It is dusky-red, frothy, thin and ununctuous in conditions where Vata is predominant. It is brown in color, dark, of the color of the cow’s urine, tarry, smoky and of the color of collyrium, in conditions where Pitta is predominant.
Signs of curability or otherwise
13 -14. The condition of the unidiscordance is curable, of bidiscordance is mitigable and that of tridiscordance is incurable. Hemothermia [raktapitta] is also incurable in persons of weak digestive fire, where the disease manifests with great violence, in persons who are em emaciated by diseases, who are old and who abstain from food.
The two directions of its spread
15. It has been declared that hemothermia spreads in indirections, upwards through seven orifices and downwards through two orifices.
16. The seven orifices are situated in the head and the two in the lower region of the trunk. The disease whose course is upwards is curable. The one whose course is downwards is mitigable and the one which spreads in both the directions is incurable.
17. If it spreads through all the orifices as well as into the hairfollicles, then the directions become innumerable and such a condition is considered terminal.
18-20. It is also incurable where there is excessive hemorrhage from either the upper or the lower orifices of the body, where the blood smells like putrid flesh, where the blood is of very dark color, where Kapha and Vata are both in a provoked condition, where there is accumulation of it in the throat, where it is accompanied with all the complications described and where it has suffered yellow, blue, green or copper discoloration, as also in a person who is emaciated and suffers from cough-
21. It is mitigable where there is bi-discordance and where there is subsidence and exacerbation of the condition and where it changes its passage from one orifice to another.
22. That condition, is curable where Hemothermia [raktapitta] spreads only in one direction, where the patient is strong, where the force of the disease is not great, where it is of recent origin, where it occurs in a favourable season and where it is not accompanied with complications.
23 The etiological factors of hemothermia [raktapitta] affecting the upper channels are mostly unctuous and hot things, and those affecting the lower channels are mostly hot and dry things.
24. The one which spreads in the upper direction is associated with Kapha and the one which spreads in the lower direction is associated with Vata. The one that spreads in both the directions gets combined with both Kapha and Vata.
The stoppage of hemorrhage in Early stage interdicted
25, The hemorrhage occurring as a consequence of the precipitated condition of the blood, in a person whose strength and flesh are not wasted and who feeds well, should not be stopped in the beginning as it is ‘safety valve hemorrhage’.
26-27. Throat-spasm, nasal fetor, fainting, anorexia, fever, gulma, splenic enlargement, constipation, leprous lesions, dysuria, dermatosis, piles, acute spreading affections, discoloration, fistula-in-ano and impairment of the functions of the intellect and the senses—these occur if the hemorrhage is stopped in the initial stage.
28. Hence, this initial development of hemorrhage in a strong person should be ignored by the physician who desires success in treatment after due consideration of the strength of the patient and the morbid condition.
29. The hemothermic condition generally becomes augmented by the toxic effects of the imperfectly digested food in the body. Hence lightening procedure should be advised at the beginning of the treatment.
30. Either lightening procedure or demulcent beverage should be advised in the beginning of hemothermia [raktapitta] after careful investigation of the channels affected, morbid humors associated, and the etiological factors.
Remedial Measures
31. If the patient feels thirst, he should be given the decoction of cuscus and sandal-wood, nut-grass, and trailing rungia, or simply water boiled and cooled.
32. The physician adept in the knowledge of the season, homologation, morbid associations, habitus and pharmaceutics, should first adminster demulcent drinks where the upper channel is affected, and thin gruel where the lower channel is affected.
33. The water, boiled with dates, grapes, mahwa and sweet falsah and cooled, should be used, mixed with sugar as a demulcent drink,
34. A demulcent drink made of the powder of roasted paddy, mixed with ghee and honey, should be given. If it is drunk at the proper time, it cures hemothermia [raktapitta] spreading in the upward direction.
35. Thus, demulcent drink may be made acid for those whose digestive fire is weak and who have homologation to acid taste; and the learned physician should use sour pomegranate and emblic myrobalan for the acidifying purpose and administer the potion.
36. The diet of the hemothermic should consist of Shali rice, Shashtika rice, wild rice, common millet, Prashantika, Shyamaka and Priyangu corn.
37. Green gram, lentils, chick pea, moth bean and pigeon pea are considered beneficial in the preparation of soup and gruel for the hemothermic.
38-40. Wild snake-gourd, neem, tender leaves of wave-leaved fig and country-willow, chiretta, karella, thorny milk-hedge plant, hogweed, the flower of variegated mountain ebony, white teak, silk cotton and any other vegetable regarded as curative of hemothermia [raktapitta] in the dietary—these vegetables, either simply boiled or fried with ghee or prepared as soup are beneficial to the hemothermic patients who are habituated to only vegetable diet.
41-42. Pigeons, doves, quails, Chakora, Vartaka quail, hare, grey partridge, black buck, red deer and black-tailed deer—these are beneficial to the hemothermics. Their meat-juices should be administered seasoned with ghee, sweetened with sugar and either unacidified or slightly acidified.
43. In hemothermia [raktapitta] with the predominance of Kapha, vegetable-soups should be prescribed and in conditions with the Vata in predominance, meat-juices should be prescribed. Now, we shall describe the preparations of gruels useful in hemothermia.
44. The gruel, prepared with the decoction of the stamens of lotus and blue lily, painted-leaved ticktrefoil and perfumed cherry, is beneficial to hemothermia patients.
45. Similarly, the gruel prepared in the decoction of sandal-wood, black cuscus, lodh and dry ginger, or the thin gruel prepared with chiretta, black cuscus and nutgrass will prove beneficial.
46-47. The gruel prepared with the decoction of fulsee flowers, cretan prickly clover, cuscus and bael; or that prepared with the decoction of lentil and painted leaved ticktrefoil; or the one prepared with the decoction of ticktrefoil and green gram, or the gruel prepared with the decoction of pea and mixed with ghee and the decoction of heart-leaved sida or the gruel prepared with the meat-juice of the pigeon, is beneficial. Thus have been described the various preparations of gruels.
48. They should be taken with honey and sugar after being cooled. They are curative of hemotherinia. These gruels may also be prepared with meat-juice
49. The flesh of rabbit combined with white goose foot is beneficial in hemothermia [raktapitta] attended with obstipation. The flesh of partridge boiled with the juice of gular fig is useful if Vata is in predominance.
50. The flesh of peacock; prepared with the infusion of wave-leaved fig, the flesh of cock with the infusion of the banyan, the flesh of quail and snipe with bael and blue lily, are beneficial.
51. When the patient is thirsty, he should be given a drink prepared with bitter drugs or juice of adipsous fruits or water prepared with ticktrefoil and the other drugs of its group or even simple water, boiled and cooled.
52. When the patient is very thirsty, the physician should investigate, the state of the secondary morbid humors, the vitality and the diet' of the patient and then give whenever he desires, a measured or a small quantity of water.
53-53½. Whatever things have been described as the etiological factors of hemothermia should be avoided by the hemothermic patient aspiring for long life and good health. Thus hag been described the systematic regimen of food and drink, curative of hemothermia [raktapitta].
Purificatory Procedure
54 56. Hereafter will be described the procedure to be done on a patient who is very strong and who suffers from severe morbidity, whose body is strong, whose vitality aud flesh are not wasted, who has developed the hemothermic condition and severe morbidity as a result of excessive diet. The condition in which purificatory therapy is indicated and which shows no complications, should be treated with purgation for purifying the lower region, and with emesis for purifying the upper region of the body.
57-58. The wise physician should use turpeth, chebulic myrobalan, fruits of purging cassia, roots of zalil and colocynth or emblic myrobalan mixed liberally with honey and sugar as -purgatives; the juices of these drugs are considered specially useful in hemothermia [raktapitta].
59-60. The emetic nut mixed with a demulcent drink, honey and sugar, or the emetic nut mixed with sugar-water or with sugar-cane juice should be given for emesis, or the kurchi fruits, nut-grass, emetic nut, liquorice and honey should be given for emesis. Emesis is the best treatment in hemothermia which spreads in the lower channels,
61. The course of demulcent drink etc., is advisable in a patient who has been affected in the upper channels and has undergone successfully the purification therapy; and the conrse of gruels etc., is advisable in a patient who is affected in the lower channels and whose Vata is not strong.
Sedative Treatment
62-64. For one, whose flesh and strength are wasted, who has been emaciated by grief, load-carrying or way-faring, who has been suffering from the effects of the heat of fire or the sun, or who has been wasted by other diseases, or who is a gravida or is old or very young, who is habituated to dry, meagre or restricted diet, who is unfit for taking emesis or purgation, or who has developed consumption—for all such kinds of hemothermia-patients the sedative line of treatment is prescribed. Now the sedative line of treatment will be explained.
A few Sedative recipes
65. The decoction of malabar nut, grapes and chebulic myrobalan, taken with sugar and honey, is curative of dyspnea, cough and hemothermia [raktapitta].
66. One should take the decoction of malabar nut with perfumed cherry, yellow ochre, extract of Indian berberry, lodh and honey as cure for hemothermia.
67. One may also take it with Himalayan cherry, stamens of lotus, scutch grass, white goose foot, blue lily, fragrant poon and lodh.
68-68½. White lotus, liquorice and honey mixed with the j nice of horsedung, or roots of camel thorn and trailing eclipta, mixed with the juice of cow dung and taken with rice water is curative of hemothermia [raktapitta].
69. Or, one may lick the juice of cow-dung or horse-dung mixed with honey and ghee.
70. The hemothermia-patient may lick the powder of the flowers of catechu, perfumed cherry, variegated mountain ebony and silk cotton, mixed with honey.
71. Or, the patient may take a linctus of the powder of Indian water chest-nut, roasted paddy, nutgrass, date and lotus stamens mixed with honey.
72. The blood of beasts and birds of Jangala land should be taken as a linctus mixed with honey. In a condition of coagulated blood, the droppings of the pigeon may be taken with honey.
Treatment of Clotted hemothermia [raktapitta]
73-73½. Black cuscus, yellow sandalwood, lodh, Himalayan cherry, perfumed cherry, box myrtle, conch, red ochre—each of these mixed with an equal amount of sandal-wood and taken with sugar and plenty of rice water, immediately relieves hemothermia [raktapitta], bronchial asthma, excessive thirst and burning.
General Recipes
74-76. Chiretta, betel nut, nut grass, white lotus, red lotus, blue lily, cuscus roots, leaves of bitter snake-gourd, cretan prickly clover, trailing rungia, lotus stalk, the barks of arjun, gular. fig, country willow, banyan, common fennel, camel thorn, bamboo manna, madder, fragrant poon, prickly amaranth, Indian sarsaparilla, gum of silk-cotton, sensitive plant—each of these prescribed in combination with sandalwood and prepared in the manner above described, proves beneficial in these diseases.
77. From this list, any one drug or all drugs combined together, prepared in the form of an overnight cold infusion or as expressed juice or in the form of a paste or pulp or of a decoction, will alleviate the hemothermic condition.
78. The cold infusion, prepared by keeping overnight the powder of green gram, fried paddy, barley, long pepper, black cuscus, nutgrass and sandalwood in the cooled decoction of heart-leaved sida, alleviates hemothermia which is of an acute condition.
79. Hemothermia [raktapitta] becomes alleviated also by a potion of the water in which lapis lazuli, pearls, precious stones, red ochre, earth, conch, gold and emblic myrobalan are kept; also by a potion of hydromel or sugarcane juice.
80. The clear supernatant fluid of the solution in water of black cuscus, lotus, blue lily, sandalwood and heated earth, should be given cooled, along with sugar and honey, for the relief of excessive hemorrhage.
81. The clear supernatant part of the solution in water, of perfumed cherry, sandalwood, lodh, Indian sarsaparilla, mahwa, nutgrass, black cuscus, fulsee flowers and earth, mixed with liquorice water and sugar, is an excellent hemostatic in hemothermia.
82. If, by the administration of the aforesaid variety of preparations or decoctions, the gastric fire is re-activated and cough is subdued, and yet the hemothermic condition is not quieted, then there occurs the sequela of Vata provocation; it should be treated in the following way—
83-84. A course of goat’s milk or cow’s milk boiled in five times its quantity of water or boiled with the drugs of the ticktrefoil group and mixed with sugar and honey, will be the best treatment. A course of milk boiled with grapes or ginger, or heart-leaved sida or small caltrops or milk, boiled with Jivaka, Rishabhaka and ghee and mixed with sugar, may be administered.
85. The milk boiled with climbing asparagus and small caltrops or leaves of wild green gram and black gram, and the two kinds of ticktrefoil, stops, bleeding quickly and specially the hemorrhage of the urinary tract accompanied with pain.
86. The milk prepared with gum of sillk cotton or with the sprouts and catkins of banyan or with cuscus, blue lily and dry ginger, is specially beneficial in bleeding of the gastro-intestinal tract.
87. In case of profuse hemorrhage, the patient should first drink the milk prepared with various astringent decoctives and then take a meal of Shali rice and milk; or he may take a potion of ghee prepared with those decoctives.
88. The ghee prepared with the decoction of vasaka plant, branches, root and leaves, with the paste of its flowers, taken with honey, stops hemorrhage immediately. Thus has been described the Vasa Ghee.
89. The ghee prepared with the juice and paste of the petioles of Bengal kino, liquefied by adding honey, may be used as a linctus; or the ghee prepared with the paste of kurchi or the ghee prepared with madder, blue lily and lodh, may be similarly used.
90. Similar is the method of preparing the ghee with zalil or with gular fig, as also with the leaves of bitter snake-gourd. All the ghees which are curative of the Pitta type of fever, are useful in hemothermia [raktapitta].
91-92. Inunctions, affusions, applications, baths, beds, chambers and other cooling measures and the best procedures of the enema described for the relief of Pitta-type of fever, should be fully made use of in hemothermia with due consideration to time and dosage. The ghee-balls which are useful in pulmonary ulcerations relieve hemothermia immediately.
93-94. If Kapha develops as a sequela to hemothermia [raktapitta] and if the hemothermic blood is inspissated and collect in the throat, a course of alkali prepared from lotus-stalk mixed with honey and ghee, should be carefully given in the proper dose. The alkalis prepared of stalks and stamens of lotus or blue lily or of Bengal kino or of perfumed cherry or of mahwa or of feather foil should be used in similar manner.
95. Ghee should be prepared, by the wise physician, with the paste of climbing asparagus, pomegranate, tamarind, Kakoli, Meda, liquorice, white yam and the root of citron and four times the quantity of milk
96 This ghee cures cough, fever, constipation, obstipation, colic and hemothermia. The ghee prepared with all the five kinds of pentaradices serves the same purpose. Thus has been described the Compound Climbing Asparagus Ghee.
97. In condition of epistasis, after the blood flowing from the nose has become free of morbidity, the preparation of the various decoctives described above should be used as nasal medication, by the physician.
98. If the morbid blood is prevented from flowing out by nasal medication, then, there occurs severe nasal catarrh or disorders of the head, discharge of blood and pus, fetor of putrid flesh from the nose, anosmia and a severe type parasitic infection.
99. Blue lily, red ochre, conch and sandal-wood mixed with sugar-water, will mike a very good nasal medication as also the juice of mango stone, or that of sensitive plant along with fulsee flowers or the gum of silkcotton with lodh.
109. Grape juice, or sugar-cane juice or milk, or the juice of scutch grass or the root-juice of camel thorn or the juice of onion, or the juice of pomegranate flowers acts as a good nasal hemostatic.
101. The oil of Buchanan’s mango prepared in milk, with the paste of liquorice and milk, or the ghee of the goat or the buffalo prepared with the paste of mango-stone and other drugs described above, or with Indian sarsaparilla, lotus and blue lily in milk makes a good nasal medication.
102-105. White and red sandal wood, white lotus, lotus, blue lily, black cuscus, country willow, cuscus, lotus stalks, scutch grass, liquorice, milky yam, roots of Shali rice, sugar cane, camelthorn plant, elephant grass, reed, sacred grass, and thatch grass; red sandalwood, moss, Indian sarsaparilla, valerian hard-wick, root of ginger grass, Riddhi, roots and flowers of lotuses, earth from the lotus pond, gular fig, holy fig, mahwa, and lodh and all astringent plants containing tannin and cooling in action, should be used as external applications. The physician desirous of curing hemothermia [raktapitta] should make use of all the above-mentioned, i.e. white sandal wood and others as external application, affusion, bath, and also in the preparation of ghees and oils,
Refrigerant therapy
106-107. Apartments with arrangement for shower-bath, cold under-ground chambers, resort to pleasant woods cooled by moist breezes, the application of vessels inlaid with azure, pearls and precious stones and made cool by putting cold water in them; leaves and flowers of aquatic plants and cooling fabrics made of silk, or plantain leaves and the leaves of lotus and blue lily are recommended for use as covers for beds and seats, in a condition of thermalgia i.e. burning sensation in the body.
108.The embraces of young women who have anointed their bodies with the paste of perfumed cherry, and the me of wet and cool lotuses and blue lily bunches as fans, are beneficial in condition of burning.
109. The enjoyment of river-sides and ponds, caves amidst snowy mountains, the hours of moonrise, lotus-lakes and the listening to pleasant tales have, all of them, a cooling effect and alleviate the condition of hemothermia [raktapitta].
Summary
Here are the two recapitulatory verses—
110-111. The etiological factors, the development, nomenclature, seat, signs and symptoms of each type of morbidity, the directions of spreading, curability, incurability and the line of treatment, the wholesome food and drink, contra-indications and the modes of purification and of sedation—all this, has the master expounded in the chapter on the Treatment of Hemothermia.
4. Thus, in the Section on Therapeutics in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the fourth Chapter entitled “The Therapeutics of Hemothermia [raktapitta-cikitsa]” is completed.
Etiology and onset
4-5. The Vata gets provoked in the abdominal cavity by excessive discharge of feces, mucus or bile, or by the pressure of the excessive formation of any of these or by suppression of the downward natural urges or by external trauma or excessive pressure, by over-indulgence in dry eats and drinks, in excessive grief or misuse of the purificatory therapy, or in excessive or wrongful bodily activity.
6. The morbid Vata, provoking the Kapha and the Pitta and blocking the passages with them, produces colicky pain in the epigastric, umbilical, hypochondriac, lumbar, and hypogastric regions and is not able to proceed further as the passages are blocked.
7. The Vata which is localised in the lower or the upper gastro-intestinal tract primarily or secondarily, becomes palpable to the touch owing to its formation into a round mass. It is called Gulma and is classified according to its causative morbid humor.
Sites
7½. Five are the regions where Gulma occurs. They are the hypogastric region, the umbilical region, the epigastric region and the two lumbar regions.
8. I shall describe the causes, the symptoms and the treatment of these five kinds of gulma.
Vata-Gulma
9. Dry eats and drinks, wrongful or excessive bodily activity, the suppression of the natural urges, excessive grief, trauma, excessive decrease in the formation of excretion and absolute abstention from food are the causes of Vata-Gulma.
10-11. It produces varying types of pain and various shapes of the affection in different regions of the abdomen, causes retention of feces and flatus, dryness of the mouth and the throat, dusky-red coloration of the skin, fever with chills, pain in the epigastric, umbilical, lumbar and hypochondriac regions and pains referred to the shoulders and headache. These symptoms become more intensified at the time of the completion of digestion and become mild on taking some food. Where these conditions occur, it is to be known as Vata Gulma; dry, astringent, bitter and pungent articles are not homologous or agreeable to the patient.
Pitta Gulma
12. The use of pungent, acid, acute, hot, irritant and dry articles, excessive anger, addiction to intoxicating drinks, excessive exposure to the heat of the sun and fire, the obstruction of chyme, the vitiation of blood—these, are said to be the causative factors of Pitta Gulma.
13 Fever, thirst, redness of the face and body, colicky and intense pain during the period of digestion of food, perspiration, misdigestion, extreme tenderness to touch like a wound—these are the signs and symptoms of Pitta Gulma.
Kapha Gulma
14. Indulgence in cold, heavy and unctuous articles, sloth or luxus alimentation and sleeping in the day are the causative factors of Kapha Gulma. All the aforesaid conditions combined are to be regarded as the causative factors of Gulma born of tri-discordance.
15. Immobility, fever with chill, prostration of limbs, nausea, cough, anorexia, heaviness of the body, cold, mild pain, and rigid protuberance are the signs and symptoms of Gulma of the Kapha type.
Bi-discordant Gulma
16. The physician should diagnose, in order to decide the correct line of medication, the three varieties of Gulma, caused by bi-discordance, by investigating the etiological factors, symptoms, the degree of intensity of the morbid humors and other combinations of symptoms.
Tri-discordant Gulma
17.The Gulma caused by tridiscordance and having the following symptoms is to be considered incurable: agonizing pain, burning, stony-hard protuberance, quick sloughing or suppuration, severe condition and collapse of the strength of the mind, body and the vital heat.
Blood Gulma
18. Women are afflicted with Gulma born of vitiated blood, owing to starvation during menstruation, fear, indulgence in dry eats and drinks, suppression of the natural urges, wrongful use of astringent therapy and emesis, and owing to also the diseases of their genital organs.
19. This Gulma moves after some time, as a whole mass, but shows no movements in any of its parts. It is accompanied with colicky pain and signs and symptoms suggestive of pregnancy. This Gulma occurs only in women and is born of vitiated blood. It should be treated after ten months have fully elapsed.
20. Hereafter, I shall describe the most effective line of treatment of Gulma as also the remedies curative thereof.
21. The Vata Gulma born of addiction to dry articles and wrongful exercise, which is acutely painful and accompanied with retention of feces and flatus, should be treated in the beginning with oleation therapy.
22. When the patient has undergone the oleation therapy in the form of diet, inunction and potions, evacuative and unctuous enemata, the physician should subject him to the sudation therapy, for the alleviation of the complaint.
23. Sudation cures Gulma by softening the channels and subduing the excited Vata and breaking open the obstructions in the passages, in the person that has already taken the unctuous therapy.
24. Unctuous drinks are beneficial in this type of Gulma and especially in the Gulma in the upper half of the abdomen. Enemata are beneficial when it affects the colon, and when it affects the umbilical region, both unctuous potions and enemata are beneficial.
25. If in Vata-Gulma, the gastric fire is strong and active and if there is obstipation of feces and flatus, the physician should give roborant, unctuous and hot eats and drinks,
26.Taking precaution not to provoke Kapha and Pitta, the physician should make repeated use of unctuous potions and both evacuative and unctuous enemata, in Vata Gulma.
27-28. While the Vata is getting almost subdued, if the Kapha or the Pitta or the blood gets provoked, the treatment of any of these conditions should be undertaken. The treatment should be given to suit the degree of provocation of the humor, during all the stages of treatment, in the beginning, the middle and the end, the utmost care being taken to preserve the normal condition of Vata.
29.If in Vata Gulma, Kapha becomes increase [???] [??pair?ng] the gastric fire, produces [????] nausea,
heaviness and torpor, the patient should be treated with emesis.
30. In Gulma of bi-discordance (Vāta-cum-Kapha), if there is colic, constipation or obstipation, suppositories, pills and powders, all of which are curative of Kapha-cum-Vata, are beneficial.
Operative treatment in Suppurated Gulma
31. If in a case of Vata-Gulma, Pitta becomes increased and causes burning sensation, the patient should be purged with mild and unctuous laxatives.
32. If Gulma is not alleviated despite proper medications indicated in Vata-Gulma, then it may be alleviated by a resort to blood-letting.
33. In the case of Pitta-Gulma caused by addiction to unctuous and hot things, mild taxation is beneficial, while in a condition caused by dry and hot things, ghee is the best sedative.
34-35, The physician, skilled in the knowledge of the proper time of treatment, on recognising that either Pitta or Pitta Gulma is lodged in the colon, should immediately eliminate it by milk-enemata medicated with bitter drugs. The physician aiming at increasing the strength of the gastric fire, should urge the patient with genially warm milk medicated with bitter [???] or by the use of Tilwaka Ghee.
36. If a patient of Gulma suffers from thirst, fever, burning sensation, colic, perspiration, weakness of digestive fire and anorexia, then bloodletting alone should be resorted to.
37. Its very root i.e. the blood supply being cut off, Gulma no longer suppurates and the swelling gets reduced. It is the blood that gives the suppurative quality and when there is no blood, neither is there pain.
38. The patient that is weakened by loss of blood should be nourished by meat-juices of Jangala animals and comforted; and if there is residual pain yet, he should be asked to take a course of the medicated ghee again.
39. If, owing to excessive augmentation of blood and Pitta and the lack of treatment, Gulma suppurates, operation is the only remedy.
Signs and Treatment
40, That Gulma is said to have not reached the stage of suppuration, which is heavy, hard in form, deeply situated under the muscles and whose color on the skin is not changed and which is firmly fixed.
41. That Gulma is to be known to have reached the stage of suppuration, which is attended with burning, shooting and throbbing pain, irritation, insomnia, malaise and fever. At that stage it should be poulticed.
42-43. One should recognise the symptoms of suppuration on finding it to be protubering and pointing and having dark-red margin and that it feels like a bladder filled with water to the touch and when on being pressed, it comes back to position, and on being pressed on one side. becomes tense and has no feeling (fluctuation). When it feels like a localised round mass to the touch and is accompanied with colicky pain, the Gulma should be known to be fully mature or suppurated.
44. Here begins the province of the surgeons as regards its treatment, and of such surgeons, as have practical experience in the art of aspiration, purification and healing of abscesses.
45. These are the various symptoms occurring during the suppuration of internal swelling. In the case of internal abscesses, there occurs edema, in the epigastric or lumbar region, while in external abscesses there occur external protrusions in the sides.
46-46½. Once it is suppurated, it softens the passages and spreads upwards or downwards. At this stage of spontaneous elimination of morbidity, the physician had better leave it alone and pay attention to the proper regimen of diet for ten or twelve days so as to prevent any complication
47-47½. After that, the purificaton potion of ghee is beneficial and after being cleansed, the patient should be given a course of ghee medicated with bitters and mixed with honey.
48-48½. Where the Kapha Gulma is brought about, by addiction; to cold, heavy and unctuous articles and, where emesis is contra-indicated and the gastric fire is weak, lightening therapy should be resorted to at first.
49-49½. If in a Gulma-patient there is dullness of the digestive fire, mild pain, a sense of heaviness and immobility in the stomach, nausea and anorexia, he should be administered emesis.
50-50½. After treating him with emesis and the lightening therapy, he should be administered hot things and a regimen of diet mixed with bitter and pungent medications.
51-51½. On finding the swelling to be hard and protuberant and accompanied with constipation and obstipation, it shoved be first skilfully sweated and on its being sweated, the physician should try to get the swelling dissolved by finger-massage.
52-52½. After undergoing the lightening, emesis and sudation therapies and having the gastric fire rekindled, the patient with Kapha Gulma should take at the proper time ghee mixed with pungent articles and alkalis.
53-53½. On finding that the Kapha Gulma has been dislodged from its seat, the physician should administer to the patient the purificatory treatment either in the form of purgation or unctuous [enema?] or deca-radices.
54-54½. On finding that the gastric fire is diminished and there is claudication of Vata and the internal system well oleated, pills, powders or decoctions should be prescribed to the patient affected with Gulma of the Kapha type.
55-55½. If Kapha Gulma has taken firm root and is extensive in size, hard, immovable and heavy, it should be subdued by administration of alkali or bv the use of medicated wines or [by?] cauterization therapy.
56-56½. The specialist skilled in the knowledge of the degree [strengthening?] morbidity shou investigate the morbid humor [habitus?], the variety of Gulma and the season, in such condition of Kapha-provocation and make use of alkalis as required.
57-57½ The physician, skilled in the knowledge of the increase aud decrease of body-vitality and morbidity of the humors, should use these alkalis on alternate days or at intervals of two or three days.
58-58½. The alkalis, constantly breaking up the sweet and unctuous Kapha in the body of the patient habituated to a diet of flesh, milk and ghee, make it trickle down from its natural habitat, by their liquefacient property-
59-59½. The medicated wines should be used for the purification of the channels of the patient with Kapha Gulma who takes the unctuous diet and who is habituated to wines, if there occur weakness of gastric fire and anorexia.
60-61½. If the Kapha Gulma does not yield to lightening therapy, emesis, sudation, potion of ghee, purgation, enemata and the administration of pills, powder, alkalis and medicated wines, owing to its being firm-rooted in the body, then the area should be cauterized with such means as arrow-heads etc., after the patient has been subjected to blood-letting.
62-62½. The heat of fire by its thermic and acute quality relieves Kapha and Vata in Gulma. These two being subdued, the formation of Gulma disappears.
63-63½. Cauterization too, is the province of the school of surgeons. The procedure of alkali therapy is the province of the specialist in alkali therapy.
64. Where there is a combination of humors, the treatment too, should be a suitable combination of these methods.
64½. Now, I shall describe the preparations that are most effective in the cure of Gulma,

Emesis in Kapha Gulma
137-140. The procedure of emesis should be done in cases where it is indicated, in patients suffering from Kapha-Gulma after they have been made to undergo the preliminary preparation with oleation and sudation. After the Gulma has softened, place all round the inner wall of a small earthen pot the burning blades of Balvaja or of small sacrificial grass, and invert the mouth of the pot over the Gulma and when it is caught tightly in the pot, it may be pulled out; and bandaging the Gulma with a cloth, the physician proficient in the technique of incision should make superficial incisions. The Gulma must be compressed by means of any instrument available among such as Vimarga [vimārga] Ajapada and Adarsha [ādarśa] instruments and kneaded, with due care not to touch the intestines or other internal viscera-

150-151. This preparation of mixed unction taken with honey is curative of Kapha-Gulma; this should be used in obstipation due to Kapha-Vata, in dermatosis, splenic disorders, abdominal disease and specially in painful gynecic disorders. Thus has been described ‘The Mixed Unctuous Substance’,
152. The indigo-ghee, already described as a purgative and as curative of Vata Gulma, should be used in double the dosage for purgation, iu cases of Kapha Gulma.
153. A person gets well-purged by taking one tola of turpeth powder impregnated well with the milky juice of thorny milk-hedge and mixed with honey and ghee.
154-158. In 1024 tolas of water decoct 25 chebulic myrobalans, 100 tolas of wild red physic nut, and 100 tolas of white flowered lead-wort. When it is reduced to one eighth its quantity, filter the solution and add to it gur equal in quantity to red physic nut (100 tolas); filter it again and put into it those chebulic myrobalans and prepare a linctus by adding eight tolas of til, sixteen tolas of powdered turpeth and four tolas each of long pepper and dry ginger; when it is cooled, add honey equal in quantity to the oil (8 tolas) and four tolas of the powders of cinnamon bark, cardamom and tamal leaf, and fragrant poon. By taking four tolas of this linctus and chewing with it one chebulic myrobalan contained in the linctus, the person who is previously oleated gets purged easily. He will eliminate one Prastha (64 tolas) of morbid matter without developing any complication.
159-160. A course of this recipe cures Gulma, edema?, piles, anemia, anorexia, cardiac disorders, assimilation disorders, jaundice, irregular fever, dermatosis, splenic disorders and constipation; this course is harmless; and the dietetic regimen, during the course, is liquid-diet made up of meat-juice and cooked rice. Thus has been described ‘The wild Croton-cum-Chebulic Myrobalan preparation’.
Treatment and Diet
161. The most effective enemata meant for a patient suffering from Kapha will be described in the Section on ‘Success in Treatment’ and the most effective prescriptions of medicated wine will be described in the chapters on the treatment of assimilationdisorders and piles.
162. The powders and pills which are prescribed for the patient suffering from Vata Gulma are considered useful in Kapha-Gulma also, if combined with double their quantity of alkali, asafoetida and Amlavetasa.
163. The alkalies indicated in assimilation disorders are regarded effective and harmless in cases of Kapha Gulma. Cauterization is recommended as a last resort.
164-165. Very old grain, beasts and birds of Jangala country and thin gruel of horse-gram, green gram, long pepper and dry ginger, dry radish, bael, three leaved caper, sprouts of jungle cork tree, bishop’s weed, white flowered lead wort;

168. Butter-milk mixed with the powder of bishop’s weed and salted with bid salt when taken acts as a digestive stimulant and the regulator of flatus, Kapha and urine.
Incurable signs of Gulma
169-170. The Gulma which has gradually kept on increasing, which has spread over an extensive area, which has taken firm root, which is covered by veins, which is convex shaped like the back of a tortoise and is accompanied with prostration, anorexia, nausea, cough, vomiting, malaise, fever, thirst, torpor and coryza, is not curable.
171. The edema occurring in the epigastric and umbilical regions, hands and feet, draws to his death the Gulma-patient who is afflicted with fever, dyspnea, vomiting and diarrhea.
Treatment of Blood Gulma
172. To the women afflicted with the sanguinous Gulma, unctuous purgatives should be given after preliminary preparation of the body with oleation and sudation and after the expiry of the normal period of gestation.
173. The linctus prepared of 512 tolas of palas-alkali and 512 tolas of ghee-cum-oil should be given in such dosage as will soften the Gulma.
173½. If this does not break it up, then medications that cleanse the vagina must be administered.
174-176. Til paste mixed with alkali or with milk of the thorny milk hedge plant, or pungent fish impregnated with the above articles may be inserted in the vagina; a swab well saturated with the bile of hog or fish, or with emetic or purgative medications, or with honey, may be inserted in the vagina. Or yeast, gur and alkali may be used for the cleansing of the vagina.

178. The enema prepared with milk, cow’s urine, alkali and pentaradices may be given. If still the blood does not appear, then operative treatment should be performed on the patient.
179. If the blood begins to flow out, she should he given meat-juice and cooked rice as diet, inunction with ghee and oil, and new wine as drink.
180. If there is excessive flow of blood, then the treatment curative of hemothermia is to be given; and if the patient is afflicted with Vata-type of pain, then all the remedies curative of Vata should be administered-
181-182. Affusions of ghee and oil, diet of partridge and fowls and pre-prandial potion of Sura wine with its supernatant fluid and ghee prepared with the spur group of drugs are indicated. The post-prandial unctuous enema of ghee medicated with drugs of the life-promoter group or unctuous enema together with the bitter group of drugs should be given in the case of excessive flow of blood.

188-189. Habitual use of wholesome eats and drinks, avoidance of the respective etiological factors, continual protection and proper condition of the gastric fire, what medications are to be done after preliminary oleation; causes, symptoms, success, line of treatment, curability and otherwise and therapeutic measures, such briefly are the therapeutics of Gulma as has been declared to Agnivesha.
5. Thus, in the Section on Therapeutics in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the fifth chapter entitled ‘The Therapeutics of Gulma’ is completed.
Etiology
4. Addiction to the pleasures of lounging and sleeping, excessive use of curds, meat juice of domestic, aquatic and wet-land animals, milks new grains and drinks, and products of gur and all things that increase Kapha are the causative factors of the anomalies of urinary secretion.
Onset
5. The Kapha having vitiated the adipose and the muscular tissues, the body-fluid becomes localised in the genito-urinary system and causes anomalies of the urinary secretion. The Pitta, too, which is provoked by hot things, vitiating those very tissues, causes in the same manner other varieties of urinary anomalies [prameha].
6. On the diminution of the other two humors, the morbid Vata draws into the genito-urinary system the essential body-elements, and gives rise to the third class of urinary anomalies. In every case the morbid humor, having reached the genitourinary system, vitiates the urine and generates urinary anomalies [prameha] corresponding to its specific nature
Curable and incurable types
7. Ten are the varieties of urinary anomalies [prameha] caused by Kapha. They are curable. Six are the varieties caused by Pitta. These are mitigable. Four are the varieties caused by Vata. These last are incurable. The first class are curable because of the unitary nature of treatment required; the second class are merely mitigable because of the incompatible nature of the treatment required; the third class is incurable because of its highly fulminating nature
Morbid factors and susceptible elements
8. The Kapha, the Pitta and the Vata are the three, vitiating factors. The adipose tissue, blood, semen, body fluid, fat, lymph, marrow, nutri ent fluid, vital essence and muscular tissue are the body-elements susceptible to vitiation in those suffering from urinary anomalies. There are precisely twenty varieties of urinary anomalies.
Kapha type
9-9¼. The following are the ten varieties caused by Kapha—(1) that wherein the urine resembles water, (2) that wherein the urine resembles sugarcane juice, (3) that wherein the urine is dense, (4) that wherein the-urine is dense and clear in the upper half, (5) that wherein the urine is white, (6) that wherein the urine is mixed with semen, (7) that wherein the urine is cold, (8) that wherein the urine is excreted slowly, (9) that wherein the urine is like the saliva, and (10) that wherein the urine contains sand.
Pitta type
10. These are the six varieties of urinary anomalies [prameha] caused by the Pitta—(1) that which resembles a solution of alkali, (2) that which is indigo-like in color, (4) that which is yellow like turmeric, (5) that which is brown like Indian madder, and (6) that which is red in color.
Vata-type
11. These are the four varieties of urinary anomalies caused by the Vata consequent on the diminution of the remaining body-elements—;1) that which is mixed with marrow, (2) that which is mixed with vital essence, (3) that which is mixed with fat, and (4) that which is mixed with lymph.
12. The given urinary anomaly [prameha] acquires its color, taste, feel and smell from the causative morbid humor. The anomaly resulting from Vata is characterised by dusky-red coloration of the urine and colicky pain. If it further acquires the characteristics of marrow, vital essence, fat or lymph, it becomes incurable.
Premonitory symptoms
13-14. Sweating, bodily fetor, flabbiness of body, inclination to lie down, sedentation and sleep, increased excretion in the stomach, eye, tongue and ear, corpulence of the body, rapid growth of hair and nails, liking for cold things, dryness of throat and palate, sweet taste in the mouth, burning sensation in the hands and feet, and swarming of ants on the urine—these are the premonitory symptoms of the approaching urinary disorder [prameha].
Line of Treatment
15. There are two types of patients—one stout and strong and the other very emaciated and weak. In the case of the emaciated, roborant medication should be done. In the case of the strong man who is affected with great morbidity, the purificatory procedure should be administered.
16. After the patient has undergone the oleation procedure, the various purificatory prescriptions, described in the Section on Pharmaceutics, should be used. Once the morbid matter has been eliminated by emesis and purgation, it is the impletion procedure alone that should be resorted to in cases of urinary anomalies.
17. Depletion in a patient of urinary disorder [prameha] may result in Gulma, wasting, phalalgia or pain in the bladder or kidney; and suppression or retention of urine. Hence, considering the strength of the gastric fire, the impletion procedure should be carried out.
Dietetic Regimen
18. In cases where the purificatory procedure is contra-indicated, the sedative line of treatment should be adopted. Accordingly, the patient should be given demulcent drinks, decoctions, linctus made of barley powder and light food, for the relief of urinary disorder.
19. Cooked barley un-mixed with unctuous articles, barley-porridge and pan-cakes together with roasted paddy powder mixed with meat-juice of gallinaceous and pecker birds and with the agreeable meat-juice of jangala animals, should be given as diet.
20-20½. The patient may be given cooked old rice with the soup of green gram or of ether pulses and bitter vegetables. He may be given Shashtika rice or grass grains mixed with oils or red physic nut and zachum oil and white mustard. But the principal diet of the patient should be barley.
21. The patient suffering from the Kapha type of urinary disorder [prameha] should eat various preparations of barley mixed with honey.
22. The barley soaked overnight in the decoction of the three myrobalans and taken with honey and Sidhn wine is the best nutrient diet for the patient, and the constant use of it indeed destroys urinary disorders.
23. The patient should use as diet barley soaked in the various decoctions prescribed for the cure of the Kapha type of urinary disorders, converting it into flour of roasted grain or into cakes or roasted in any other form mixed with gur.
24. Various eatables, prepared or barley which has been previously given to donkeys, horses, cows, swans and deer and excreted by them in their dung, should be used. In similar manner eatables prepared of bamboo barley and wheat should be given to the patient.
Remedies in Kapha-type
25. The purificatory procedures, emesis and lightening therapy, administered at appropriate times cure the urinary anomalies of the Kapha type; and purgation, impletion and sedation procedures cure anomalies of the Pitta type.
26. The patient suffering from urinary disorder [prameha] may take the decoction of Indian berberry, deodar, the three myrobalans and nut-grass; or he may take powdered turmeric with honey and the juice of emblic myrobalan.
27-29. (1) Chebulic myrobalan, box myrtle and lodh; (2) Patha, embelia, bark of arjun and common Indian linden; (3) turmeric, Indian berberry, valerian hardwick and embelia; (4) bark of kadamba, common saul, arjuna and bishop’s weed; (5) Indian berberry, embelia, bark of catechu and crane tree; (6) deodar, costas, eagle-wood and sandal-wood; (7) Indian berberry, wind killer, three myrobalans and Patha, (8) Patha, trilobed virgin’s bower aud small caltrops; (9) bishop’s weed, cuscus grass, chebulic myrobalans, and guduch; (10) piper chaba, chebulic myrobalan, white-flowered leadwort, and dita bark; thus we have described in the foregoing ten verses ten formulas of decoction to be taken with honey by persons suffering from urinary anomalies of the Kapha-type.
Remedies in Pitta-type
30-(1). Cuscus grass, lodh, extract of Indian berberry and red sandal wood; (2) cuscus. grass, nut grass, emblic and chebulic myrobalans; (3) bitter snake-gourd, neem bark, emblic myrobalan and guduch; (4) nut-grass, chebulic myrobalan, bark of Himalayan cherry and kurchi; (5) lodh, fragrant sticky mallow, yellow sandal-wood and fulsee flowers; (6) bark of neem, arjun, Indian hog plum, turmeric and blue lily; (7) bark of siris, common saul, arjun and fragrant poon; (8) perfumed cherry, lotus, blue water lily and palas; (9) bark of holy fig and Patha, spinous kino and country willow; (10) Indian berberry, blue lily and nut grass; the foregoing ten formulas of decoction to be taken with honey, a single formula being described in each quarter of a verse, are indicated for persons suffering from urinary anomalies of the Pitta-type.
33. The first two prescriptions of decoctives are indicated in all kinds of urinary disorders; while all decoctives may be used severally as indicated, in preparations of demulcent drinks, iu impregnation of barley and in articles of food and drink.
Remedies in Vata-type
34. If the urinary disorder [prameha] originates from the discordance of Vata, the oils and ghees prepared from these decoctives are to be given; the morbidity pertaining to fat and Kapha is quieted by decoctions; while Vata is quieted by unctuous substances.
Treatment of Mixed types
35. The person suffering from urinary disorders of Kapha-cum-Pitta-type may lick the powders of the following drugs with honey—(1) kamala, bark of dita and flowers of common saul; (2) beleric myrobalan, white cedar and kurchi bark; (3) and the flowers of wood apple.
36. These, reduced to paste, should be taken with the juice of emblic myrobalan, in the dose of one tola, at the prescribed time and when this is digested the patient should take a, meal of old grains with agreeable meat-juice of Jangala animals.
37. On ascertaining whether it is in the wake of Kapha or of Pitta that Vata has appeared as a sequel, the physician has to make the proper choice as regards the unctuous adjuvant to be used; in the case of Kapha, oil prepared with decoctions alleviattve of the Kapha type of urinary disorders [prameha] is to be used while in the case of Pitta, ghee prepared with decoctions alleviative of Pitta is indicated.
38-39. Small caltrops, common mountain ebony, white catechu, marking nut, Indian atees, lodh, sweet flag, bitter snake gourd, arjun, neem, nut-grass, turmeric, Himalayan cherry, bishop’s weed, Indian madder, eagle wood, sandal wood; the oil prepared with each or all of the groups of the above decoctives should be given to the patient affected with Kapha associated with Vata; ghee prepared similarly should be given to the patient affected with Pitta. In the event of tri-discordance a combined preparation of oil and ghee should be given.
40. Decoction prepared of the three myrobalans, India berberry, colocynth and nut-grass should be given with he paste of turmeric and honey in all kinds of [se?? e] conditions of urinary disorders [prameha].
Lodh wine
41-43. Lodh, long zedoary, orris root, small cardamom, trilobed virgins bower, embelia, the three myrobalans, bishop’s weed, chaba pepper, perfumed cherry, betel nut, colocynth, chiretta, kurroa, beetle killer, valerian hard wickwhite-flowered leadwort, roots of long pepper, costus, Indian atees, Patha. kurchi seeds, fragrant poon, colocynth, shell, cinnamon leaf, black pepper, and rush-nut; take one tola of each of these drugs and decoct in 1024 tolas of water, till it is reduced to one fourth quantity (256 Lolas); then filter it and mix with half the quantity of honey (128 tolas) and put it in a vessel well smeared with ghee and keep for a fortnight.
44. The course of this medicated honey wine of the dose of eight tolas soon cures urinary disorders of Kapha and Pitta types; it also cures anemia, piles, anorexia, assimilation-disorders, leprosy and various kinds of skin diseases. Thus has been described ‘The medicated Honey-wine’.
45.Taking the above described decoction of lodh and mixing it with 32 tolas of red physic nut, 32 tolas of sugar-candy and equal quantity of honey; similarly, taking the above described decoction and adding 16 tolas of marking nut, 32 tolas of sugar-candy and equal quantity of honey; make two separate medicated wines.
46. The patient may drink either water prepared with catechu or small sacrificial grass, or honey-water, or the decoction of the three myrobalans, or mild Sidhu wine or good grape-wine of the first quality and of a ripe vintage.
47. He may eat the flesh of beasts and birds roasted on a spit or the varied preparations of barley. The physician may relieve the urinary disorders caused by over-impletion by purificatory procedure, medicated wines, decoctives and linctuses.
48. If a man uses habitually roasted barley, dry-baked barley powder, green gram and emblic myrobalan, he does not get urinary disorders, leucoderma, dysuria, and dermatosis born of Kapha.
49. The tested remedies described by me for the reduction of the adipose element or in the treatment of disorders caused by impletion, may also be used in the treatment of urinary disorders [prameha] born of Kapha and Pitta.
50. Urinary disorders yield readily to the various courses of exercise, to intense friction massage, to bath, affusions and applications with fragrant sticky mallow, cardamom, eagle-wood and sandal-wood.
Depletion therapy
51. The physician, knowing that the increase of body-fluid, adipose tissue and Kapha, is the cause of urinary disorders, should administer the procedure of depletion at the very outset in the treatment of urinary disorders caused by Kapha and Pitta.
Other Conditions and Remedies
52. Treatment that has been previously prescribed in the urinary disorders of Vata type is also indicated in urinary disorders with provoked Vata as complication. It is in the extremely debilitated subjects of urinary disorders that Vata becomes provoked and it is needless to worry about irremediable conditions.
53. Those which have been identified as causative factors in a given case of urinary disorder should be avoided in that particular case. Just as the avoidance of morbific factors ensures the prevention of disease, so also it constitutes the cure of disease which has already arisen.
54. In a case where a patient passes yellow or red-colored urine, without showing the premonitory symptoms of urinary disorder, the morbid condition should not be diagnosed as a case of urinary disorder, for it is really a condition of hemothermia.
55.In case where the urine is found to be sweet, slimy and honeylike, the condition may admit of two different diagnoses. If the body-elements are found to be in a depleted condition, the case should be diagnosed as coming under the Vata type; if on the contrary, the case reveals a plethoric condition, then it should be diagnosed as belonging to the Kapha type.
56.The Kapha and Pitta types of urinary disorders if preceded by their respective premonitory symptoms, and those urinary disorders which have gradually culminated into the Vata type, are not curable. The urinary disorders due to Pitta are generally palliable only; but if the fat element has not been impaired, they admit of [curative?] treatment.
Incurability of Congenital types
57. Persons with congenital urinary disorder or those born of diabetic parents are incurable owing to germo-spermic morbidity. Similarly those affected with hereditary taint are considered incurable.
58. The seven inflammatory conditions described by me separately in the chapter on Nomenclature of Diseases (Chap. XVII Sutra.), are to be treated by expert surgeons by operative, antiseptic, cleansing and healing procedures.
Summary
Here are the recapitulatory verses—
59-61. The causes, the morbid humor, the susceptible body-elements in urinary disorders [prameha], their curability, the resemblances of urine, the two types of patients, the three modes of treatment, the disadvantages of over-depletion, the eatables prepared of barley, the demulcent drinks, decoctions curative of urinary disorders, oils, ghees and linctuses, articles of diet, the most effective medicated wines, the various courses of exercise,, baths, massages, fragrant applications—all these, are described for the cure of urinary disorders in the chapter on ‘Therapeutics of Urinary Disorders’.
6. Thus, in the Section on Therapeutics in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the sixth chapter entitled ‘The Therapeutics of the Anomalies of the Urinary Secretion [prameha-cikitsa]’ is completed.
Etiology
4-10. The constant use of mutually incompatible eats and drinks, or liquid, unctuous and heavy articles of diet, the suppression of the generated urge for vomiting and other calls of nature, indulgence in exercise or exposure to heat after a surfeit-meal, irregular indulgence in cold or hot food or fasting or over-eating, using of cold water suddenly after being afflicted with heat, fatigue or fear, indulgence in pre-digestion meals, wrongful administration of the five purificatory procedures, habitual use of new grain, curds or fish, excessive use of salt, or acid articles or of black gram, radish, pasted articles, til, milk or gur, sex-act before the ingested food is digested, day sleep, the persecution of wise men and elders and the committing of sinful acts—by these factors, all the three humors—Vata Pitta and Kapha, which have become morbid, vitiate the skin, blood, flesh and the body-fluid. This is the complex of the seven body-elements affected in dermatosis [kushtha]. As a result of such affection, eighteen types of dermatoses are produced. Dermatosis is never the result of the discordance of only a single humor.
Premonitory symptoms
11-12. Anesthesia, hyperhidrosis, anidrosis, discoloration, eruption of rashes, horripilation, pruritus, pricking pain, fatigue, exhaustion, excessive pain, rapid formation and chronicity or ulcers, burning sensation, numbness in the limbs—these, are the premonitory symptoms of dermatosis [kushtha].
Names and signs of symptoms of eighteen types of Dermatosis
13. Hereafter, I shall describe the signs and symptoms of the eighteen kinds of dermatosis [kushtha], namely, Kapala [kapāla], Udumbara, Mandala [maṇḍala], Rishyajihva [ṛṣyajihva], Pundarika [puṇḍarīka], Sidhma, Kakanaka [kākaṇaka], Ekakushtha [ekakuṣṭha], Carma, Kitima [kiṭima], Vipadika [vipādikā], Alasaka, Dadru, Carmadala, Pama [pāmā], Visphotaka [visphoṭaka], Shataru [śatāru] and Vicarcika [vicarcikā].
14. The dermatosis which is dark-red in color like the broken piece of an earthen pot, which is dry, hard, thin, very painful and irregular in shape, is named the ‘Kapala’ dermatosis.
15. The dermatosis which is accompanied with burning, pruritus, pain and redness, which is covered with tawny hair and which resembles the gular fig in color is named the ‘Udumbara’ dermatosis.
16 The dermatosis which is whitish reddish, localised, piled up, glossy elevated at the edges and overlaps one another, is named the ‘Mandala’ dermatosis and is formidable in nature.
17. The dermatosis which is hard, red in the margins and dark in the centre, painful and has resemblance in form to the tongue of a musk-deer, is named the ‘Rishyajihva’ dermatosis.
18. The dermatosis which is whitish, red in the margins, which resembles the petal of a white lotus, which is elevated and accompanied with burning, is named the ‘Pundarika’ dermatosis.
19. The dermatosis which is white or coppery, thin, which gives out fine dust when rubbed, which is of the color of the flower of the bottlegourd and which generally makes its appearance on the chest, is named the ‘Sidhma’ dermatosis.
20 The dermatosis which resembles in color the jequirity seed, which is not suppurating or acutely painful, and which displays the fully developed symptoms of tridiscordance is named the ‘Kakana’ dermatosis. It is incurable. Thus have been described the seven major varieties of dermatosis.
21. That is named the ‘Ekakushtha’ dermatosis, which does not sweat, which is extensive in size and which resembles in form the scales of the fish. That is ‘Carma-kushtha’ dermatosis where the skin is thick like the elephant’s skin.
22. That is named the ‘Kitima’ dermatosis which is dark in color, rough to the touch like a scar and hard. That is known as the ‘Vipadika’ dermatosis, where there are fissures in hands and feet attended with acute pain.
23. That is known as the ‘Alasaka’ dermatosis which is full of itching aud red papules. That is known as the ‘Dadru’ dermatosis which is accompanied with itching, redness and pimples. It is circular in shape and elevated.
24, That is known as the ‘Carmadala’ dermatosis which is red, itching, attended with eruption, painful and which breaks open and is tender to touch.
25. That is known as the ‘Pama’ dermatosis which has whitish, dark and red papules with severe itching. That is known as the ‘Visphota’ dermatosis, which has white and red papules and thin skin.
26. That is known as the ‘Sataru’ dermatosis which is red and dark, which causes burning pain and has many fissures. ‘Vicarcika’ dermatosis is that which has itching eruptions, which is dark and which has profuse discharge. Thus have been described the eleven minor varieties of dermatosis.
27. If the provocation of Vata is in preponderance, there occurs ‘Kapala’ dermatosis; if Kapha, there results ‘Mandala’ dermatosis; if Pitta, then ‘Udumbara’ dermatosis; and if all three are equally provoked, then there occurs ‘Kakana’ dermatosis.
28. In bi-discordance of Vata-cum-Pitta, Kapha-cum-Pitta and Vata-cum Kapha, there occur ‘Rishyajihva’, ‘Pundarika’ and ‘Sidhma’ dermatosis respectively.
29. The ‘Carma’, ‘Ekakustha’, ‘Kitima’, ‘Vipadika’ and ‘Alasaka’ are resultants from the preponderance of Vata-cum-Kapha.
30. In Pama, Shataru, Visphota, Dadru and Carmadala, there is mostly preponderance of Pitta-cum-Kapha and in Vicarcika, there is preponderance of Kapha.
Treatment in view of Predominant Morbidity
31. All the varieties of dermatosis [kushtha] result from discordance of all the three humors. Hence the time of treatment should be decided upon after determining the varying degree of morbidity of each humor by its specific characteristics.
32. The particular humor whose characteristic symptoms have become predominant should be first alleviated and the treatment of the other subordinate humors should be undertaken afterwards.
33. By the diagnosis of the particular variety of the dermatosis [kushtha] , the predominant humoral morbidity is known; and similarly, by the diagnosis of the predominant morbid humor, the variety of the dermatosis is recognised. The characteristics of diseases throw light on the nature of the causative humors and the causative humors in turn throw light on the nature of the disease.
34-35. Dryness, atrophy, pricking pain, aching pain, contraction, dilatation, hardness, roughness, horripilation, and dusky-red coloration are the signs and symptoms of dermatosis of the Vata type. Burning, redness, exudation, suppuration, smell of rawmeat, softening and sloughing are the symptoms of dermatosis of the Pitta type.
36. Whiteness, coldness, pruritus, localisation, elevation, heaviness, sliminess, the eating away of the part by parasites and softening are the symptoms of dermatosis of the Kapha type.
Curability and incurability
37. The wise physician should consider that condition to be incurable which is accompanied with all the signs and symptoms combined, if the patient be low of vitality, afflicted with thirst and burning, and if his gastric fire is almost extinguished and parasites have greatly destroyed the bodytissues.
38. That condition, where Vata and Kapha are predominant or only one humor is in excess, is not formidable; but the conditions where Kapha and Pitta or Vata and Pitta are predominant are formidable.
Therapeutic Measures
39. In the treatment of dermatosis [kushtha] where Vata is predominant, ghee should be administered; where Kapha is predominant, the procedure of emesis should be done and where Pitta is predominant, blood-letting should be done, after purgation is given to the patient.
40 The various preparations of emesis and purgation, described in the Section on Pharmaceutics, should be resorted to in the treatment of dermatosis [kushtha] . In dermatosis of minor types, cupping should be done after making incision in the skin; and in major types venesection is beneficial.
41. The patient with excessive morbidity should be subjected repeatedly to the purificatory procedures with due care to preserve his strength and vitality, for if excessive elimination of the impurities is done then the Vata, getting provoked, quickly overpowers the debilitated patient.
42. After the cleansing of the gastro-intestinal tract and after depletion of blood, a potion of unctuous medication is advised, for Vata quickly makes its entry into the empty gastrointestinal tract of the debilitated patient.
43. In dermatosis affecting the upper parts of the body, if the morbid humor has got precipitated in the stomach, the patient should be subjected to the procedure of emesis by the use of kurchi seeds, emetic nut, liquorice and wild snake-gourd mixed with the juice of neem.
44. Cold infusions, decoctions as well as various kinds of honey and liquorice are used as emetics. For purgation in dermatosis turpeth, red physic nut and three myrobalans are recommended.
45.Sauviraka wine, Tushodaka wine, Sidhu wine and simple wire may be mixed with purgative preparations. When the patient is properly purged, the usual after-treatment of the purgative procedure is recommended.
46. The patient is to [be administered corrective enema prepared of Indian berberry, yellow-berried nightshade, fragrant sticky mallow, bitter snake-gourd, neem, emetic nut aud purging cassia mixed with kurchi seeds and nut-grass and with unctuous substances.
47. If after purgation and evacuative enema, the Vāta has become increased and the physician thinks it necessary to give an unctuous enema, he should administer the unctuous substance prepared with emetic nut, liquorice, neem, kurchi and bitter snake-gourd.
48. Nasal medication prepared of rock-salt, red physic nut, black pepper, sweet marjoram, long pepper, fruits of Indian beech and embelia, is curative of parasitic infection, dermatosis [kushtha] and provoked Kapha-
49. By using errhine smokes described in the Section on General Principles, the parasitic infection in the head and leprous skin-lesions situated in the head get alleviated.
50. The firm and indurated skin-lesions of the Mandala dermatosis should be sweated by the hot-bed and steam-kettle methods of sudation and then the congestion of blood in the lesions should be relieved by rubbing them with the ‘Kūrca’ (a brush-like instrument).
51. After sweating the patient with the congenially hot lump-sudation method, with the flesh of the wet-land and aquatic animals, the elevated skin lesions should be scraped with a sharp instrument.
52. And for drawing out the blood, a horn or bottle-gourd may be applied (wet cupping) after making superficial lesions in the skin, or the part may be depleted by application of leeches.
53. The external applications, which are used after thoroughly removing the vitiated blood from the lesions in those who have been administered the purificatory procedure, prove to be immediately effective.
54. Where the use of instruments is not advisable and where there is anesthesia, application of caustics should be done after removing the vitiated blood and the morbidity.
55. If the skin lesions are stony hard, indurated and devoid of sensation, localised and chronic, then the patient, after being administered antidotes as internal medication, should be given an external application of the same poisonous drugs.
56-57. If the skin lesions are rigid and insensible, devoid of sweat and itching, they should be rubbed with brush made of the twig of red physic nut, turpeth, Indian oleander, Indian beech or kurchi, or with the leaves of Spanish jasmine, mudar or neem or with sharp instruments or with cuttie fish-bone, or with a dry cake of cow-dung, after which external applications should be made.
58. In dermatosis [kushtha] of the Pitta type, the same procedure as advised for the relief of the Vata-cum-Kapha type, should be done as also elimination of Kapha, Pitta and blood and sedation by means of bitter decoctives,
59. Various ghees medicated with bitter drugs and other foremost remedies, internal or external, effective in curing hemothermia, should be administered in dermatosis of the Pitta type.
Some Specific Recipes
60. Thus has been described the line of treatment of dermatosis according to its classification with reference to the predominant morbid humors in each condition. Now I shall describe the medications which are curative of dermatosis in general, taking the morbid lesions as the common feature of all types of dermatosis [kushtha].
61. The potion of Indian berberry, or extract of Indian berberry-mixed with cow’s urine cures dermatosis. Similarly, chebulic myrobalan taken for the period of a month mixed with the three spices, gur and til-oil cures dermatosis.
62-63. Reduce to powder four tolas each of the roots of wild snake gourd and of colocynth, the pulp of the three myrobalans and two tolas each of zalil and kurroa and one tola of dry ginger. The patient may take, as potion, the decoction prepared in water with four tolas of this powder. It acts as a curative. When it is digested, he may ingest the meat-juice of Jangala beasts and birds with cooked old Shali-rice.
64. A six days’ course of this procedure will eradicate dermatosis [kushtha], edema, assimilation disorders, piles of even a formidable type, jaundice, pain in the epigastric and hypogastric regions and irregular fever.
65-66. The powder of nut-grass, the three spices, the three myrobalans, Indian madder, deodar and the two varieties of pentaradices, dita bark, neem bark, colocynth, white flowered leadwort and trilobed virgin’s bower mixed with nine times this quantity of roasted paddy flour, and prepared with honey and ghee, if taken as a regular daily dose, acts as an effective cure for dermatosis [kushtha] .
67. It is a cure also for edema, anemia, leucoderma, assimilation disorders, piles, inguinal bubo, fistula-in-ano, pimples, pruritus and eruptions. Thus has been described ‘The compound Nut-grass Powder’.
68-69. Take eight tolas of the three myrobalans, atees, kurroa, neem bark, kurchi seeds, sweet flag, snake gourd, long pepper, turmeric, Indian berberry, Himalayan cherry, trilobed virgins bower, colocynth, chiretta and palas and double the quantity (16 tolas) of turpeth and double this again of Brahmi (32 tolas), and reduce these into powder. This powder is a great remedy for skin lesions with loss of sensation.
70 A course of sulphur with the juice of Spanish jasmine and honey is an excellent remedy for seventeen (all but one) varieties of dermatosis [kushtha]. So is the course of iron pyrites with cow’s urine.
71. The person suffering from dermatosis may take consolidated mercury by preparation with sulphur or with iron pyrites. This is a panacea for all diseases.
72. Or, a course of mercury prepared with diamond and mineral pitch or with the preparation of gum-guggul should be taken by the patient. This is a panacea for all diseases.
73-75. Decoct 32 tolas of catechuwood and the pitth of deodar, and add to that decoction 64 tolas of honey and use it instead of water. Put into it 32 tolas of iron powder and add 1 tola of each of the three myrobalans, small cardamom, cinnamon bark, black pepper, cinnamon leaves, fragrant poon and sugar in a quantity equal to that of honey; keep this in an iron pot for a month. Taking this honey-wine, the patient gets relieved of dermatosis and leprosy. Thus has been described ‘The Honey-wine’.
76 79. Place 1024 tolas of catechudecoction in a pot lined with ghee and add 24 tolas of the powder containing the three myrobalans, the three spices embelia, turmeric, nut grass, vasaka, kurchi seeds, the bark of Indian berberry, cinnamon and guduch, and keep it for a month in a heap of grain. A course of this remedy taken duly early every morning will cure the major types of dermatosis within a month and minor skin diseases in a fortnight besides piles, dyspnea, fistula-in-ano, cough; leprosy, urinary disorders and consumption. By drinking this medicated wine called gold-drop wine a man acquires golden complexion. Thus has been described ‘The Gold-drop Wine’.
80. The medicated wine prepared similarly of purging cassia should be taken in dermatosis of Vata and Kapha types or that of Pitta type but more especially in dermatosis of Kapha type.
81. The medicated wine of gur along with the three myrobalans, white flowered leadwort, betel nut, deca-radix, red physic nut, cinnamon bark and honey is an effective cure for dermatosis [kushtha] .
82.Light diets are to be considered wholesome in all kinds of dermatosis and also vegetables of bitter taste, and food and ghee prepared with marking nut. three myrobalans or neem.
83. Old grains, the flesh of Jangala animals, green grams and snakegourd are recommended as diet while heavy and acid articles, milk, curds, flesh or wetland animals, fish, gur and til are contra-indicated.
84. The application prepared of cardamom, costus, Indian berberry, dill, white flowered leadwort, embelia, extract of Indian berberry and chebulic myrobalan proves beneficial in dermatosis.
85-86. The powder of white flowered leadwort, cardamom, scarlet fruited gourde vasaka, turpeth, mudar, and dry ginger should be impregnated with palas-alkali prepared in cow’s urine. The lesions of Mandala dermatosis when plastered with this powder and beaded by exposure to the sun’s rays, soon burst open and dissolve.
87. Take nardus, black pepper, rock salt, turmeric, Indian valerian, thorny milk-hedge plant, kitchen soot, urine, ox-bile, alkali and palas. The application prepared out of these is curative of dermatosis [kushtha].
88.The application prepared of the powder of tin, lead or iron is curative of ‘Mandala’ dermatosis. The plaster prepared out of common fig, white flowered leadwort, yellow night shade, meat-juice of iguana, rock-salt, deodar and cow’s urine is curative of Mandala dermatosis.
89-90. ‘Medaka’ wine prepared properly by mixing clear alkali-solution of plantain, palas, trumpet-flower and hijjal along with flesh or flour or yeast is beneficial as potion and its sediment of yeast is good in the form of application in dermatosis. It cures Mandala dermatosis if exposed to the sun after application, and acts also as germicide.
91.The bath, prepared of nutgrass, emetic nut, the three myrobalans, Indian beech, purging cassia, kurchi seeds, Indian berberry and dita bark, is called the ‘Siddharthaka, bath’.
92. This decoction can be used as an emetic or a purgative. It is dermic-cosmetic and ou being rubbed on the skin, cures skin lesions and all kinds of dermatosis [kushtha] and edema. It acts also as a remedy, for anemia.
92½. The application, prepared of costus seeds of Indian beech and fetid cassia, is curative of dermatosis.
93-94. Similar is the action of the application prepared of seeds of fetid cassh, rock-salt, extract of Indian berberry, wood-apple and loch. The application prepared of roots of white oleander, fruits of kurchi, Indian beech, bark of Indian berberry and sprouts of Spanish jasmine, is a certain cure for dermatosis [kushtha].
95. The paste prepared of lodb, falsee flowers, kurchi seeds, Indian beech and Spanish jasmine should be applied or rubbed over the dermic lesions
96. The hark of Shirisha, flower of the cotton tree, leaves of the purging cassia and black nightshade, made into a paste separately, make four kinds of application curative of dermatosis. Thus have been described the various applications.

Summary
Here are the recapitulatory verses—
178-180. Etiological factors, susceptible body elements, various symptoms, which humors are predominant in which conditions, the characteristic signs of the humors in various types of dermatosis [kushtha] and a brief account of the preponderance of humors; curable, incurable and formidable conditions of dermatosis and the tested remedies of dermatosis, the cures and symptoms of leprosy, the degree of seriousness and mildness and their treatment—these, in brief, are. the topics dealt with, in this chapter on the Therapeutics of Dermatosis, by the great sage for the increase of the memory and the intelligence of his disciple Agnivesha.
7. Thus, in the Section on Therapeutics in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the seventh chapter entitled ‘The Therapeutics of Dermatosis [kushtha-cikitsa]’ is completed.
Primogenesis
3-10. The sages heard an ancient tale of passion concerning the moon as it was narrated among the gods. The moon was so excessively attached to Rohini [rohiṇī], even to the extent of neglecting his physical well-being that his body became very emaciated by the loss of the unctuous element. The great progenitor, Daksha, enraged by the conduct of the moon who neglected the other daughters of Daksha whom be had also taken as his wives, exhaled his wrath through his breath; for indeed the moon took all the twenty-eight of the great progenitor’s daughters for his wives, but failed to live impartially with all of them. Thus, cursed by the great progenitor, consumption [yakshma] entered into the moon who had failed to treat all his wives impartially, and who was submergedin passion and had grown weak. Having grown lustreless in consequence of the great wrath of the progenitor, the moon went to seek his forgiveness, taking the gods and the divine sages with him. The progenitor, finding him to have come back to the path of virtue, was gracious to him and the moon received his treatment from the Ashvius. After he was liberated from the grip of the disease, he shone greatly. The Ashvins having increased his vital essence he acquired also great purity of mind.
11. Wrath, consumption, fever and disease—all mean the same thing and signify suffering. Since this disease first befell the king (of the stars) it is called the royal disease [i.e., raja-yakshma].
12. This disease of consumption, having been turned away by the Ashvin Twins, came down to the mortal world and here makes its entry into men, finding its fourfold causative factor.
The Tetrad of Factors
13. Over-exertion, suppression of natural urges, wasting and fourthly irregular diet, are the etiological factors of consumption [yakshma].
14-15. If a man gets his chest injured by the strain of fighting, study, load-lifting, way-faring, jumping, swimming and such other hard tasks or by a fall, trauma or any other undertakings beyond one’s strength, the Vata, being provoked in the body, precipitates the other two humors and quickly spreads over the entire body.
16-19. If that Vata gets localised in the head, it causes headache; if it lodges in the throat it impedes the function of the throat and produces coughs change of voice and anorexia; if it is localised in the side of the chest, it causes pleurodynia; it causes loosening of stools, if it is localised in the rectum; if it is localised in the joints, it causes pendiculation and fever; and if it is localised in the chest, it causes pectoral pain. Owing to erosion in the chest the person expectorates with great trouble sputum mixed with blood from the worn-out chest (giving the characteristic ‘cracked pot’ sound) and suffers severe pain in the chest. Thus, a man given to reckless actions is afflicted with consumption characterised by these eleven symptoms. Therefore the wise man should never resort to such inconsiderate actions.
20-21. If a person suppresses the generated urge for flatus, urine or feces, owing to bashfulness, aversion, or fear, then as a reaction to this suppression, the Vata. provoking the Kapha and the Pitta, carries them upwards, sideways or downwards and produces various disorders.
22-23. Coryza, cough, change of voice, anorexia, pleurodynia, headache, fever, shoulder-ache, body-ache, frequent vomiting and loose stools with the signs of tri-humoral discordance—these are the syndrome of eleven signs and symptoms in consideration of which consumption is considered a major disease.
24. Owing to jealousy, eagerness, fear, terror, anger, grief, excessive emaciation, excessive sexual indulgence and fasting, there occurs diminution of the semen and the vital essence.
25-26. Consequent upon the loss of the unctuous element of the body, the Vata increases and provokes the other two humors and causes these eleven disorders viz., coryza, fever, cough, body-ache, headache, dyspnea, loose stools, anorexia, pleurodynia loss of voice and heat in the shoulder region.
27. These eleven symptoms indicate the presence of this major disease—consumption [yakshma], which, arising from wasting, wastes away life.
28. The Vata and other humors getting provoked by promiscuous eats and drinks taken irregularly, generate serious diseases
29.They obstruct the circulatory channels of blood etc., and being vitiated, create a fertile soil for diseases and also stop the nourishment of the body-elements.
30-32. Coryza, ptyalism, cough, vomiting and anorexia, fever, shoulder -ache and vomiting of blood (hemoptysis), pleurodynia, headache and change of voice—these are known as the respective symptoms caused by Kapha, Pitta and Vata. Thus have been described the eleven signs and symptoms of the syndrome of disease called the royal disease (i.e., consumption) resulting from its etiological factor which has been stated to be fourfold.
Premonitory Symptoms
33-37½ The premonitory symptoms are coryza, debility, inclination to find fault where there are none, morbid appearances in the body, disgust, loss of strength and flesh in spite of good feeding, craving for women wine and flesh, and fondness for good dress; falling often of flies, insects, hair and straw in food and drink and rapid growth of hair and nails being attacked in dreams by birds, wasps and beasts of prey, climbing up of heaps of hair, bones or of ashes in dreams; hallucinations of the drying up of reservoirs, the dwindling of hills and forest and the falling of stars and planets—these are to be known as the premonitory symptoms of consumption of various types
38. I shall now describe the signs and symptoms and the treatment of this disease, as proposed.
39.The body-elements attain their mature condition by their own innate metabolic heat, and the circulatory channel of each of these elements nourishes the body-element next to it in order.
49. By the obstruction of the circulatory channels and as a result of the diminution of blood and other nutrient elements, as also of the innate heat of the body-elements, the pathological changes of consumption are brought about.
Fecal strength in Consumption [yakshma]
41. Under these conditions, whatever food staying in the gastro-intestinal tract undergoes digestive process, is converted mostly into excretory matter and very little is assimilated by the body as vital juice.
42. Hence the excretory or fecal matter should be specially taken care of in the body of the consumptive where all body-elements are atrophied and hence the elementary fecal matter is the only source of strength left for him.
Syndrome of eleven ailments
43. As the circulatory channels are obstructed, the nutrient fluid remains in its own habitat, increases in quantity and flows upwards in various forms pushed up by the cough.
44. In consequence of this are produced the six or the eleven types of symptoms, the syndrome of which is designated ‘consumption [yakshma].’
45-46. Cough, heat in the shoulder region, change of voice, fever, pleurodynia, headache, vomiting of blood and phlegm, dyspnea, diarrhea and anorexia are the eleven symptoms of consumption [yakshma]; or they are also six, viz., cough, fever, pleurodynia, change of voice, diarrhea and anorexia.
47. With eleven, six or even three of the symptoms, a patient is incurable if he is loosing flesh and strength, but he is curable if he is behaving otherwise in spite of showing all the symptoms.
48. The Kapha, blood or Pitta situated in the base of the nasal cavity flows downwards along with the breath, in the person whose head is swollen with Vata.
49-50. Hence there occurs a severe type of nasal catarrh (cata—down, and rheo—to flow) which causes emaciation of the body; its signs and symptoms are headache, heaviness in the head, loss of smell, fever, cough, increase of mucus-secretion, change of voice, anorexia, fatigue and asthenia, of the senses, and then consumption makes its appearance.
51. The consumptive while coughing expectorates slimy, dense, stinking, greenish or white-yellowish matter along with Kapha in the sputum.
The three aspects of Consumption and Minor traits
52. Great heat in the shoulder and sides of the chest, burning in the hands and feet, and pyrexia of the whole body are the symptoms of consumption.
53-55. Change of voice is produced, by morbid Vata, Pitta or Kapha or blood or by strain of coughing or by
coryza. The voice becomes husky, weak and unstable if caused by the Vata; if by Pitta, there will be burning of the palate and throat and the patient does not like to speak; and if caused by Kapha, the voice is low, choked and is affected with a wheeze; owing to the obstruction to the blood, the voice becomes low and comes out with difficulty; the throat becomes injured by the strain of excessive coughing and in case of coryza the characteristics of the voice resemble the condition in Vata and Kapha affections
56. The consumptive patient is afflicted with pain in the sides of the chest which is inconstant and manifests during the respiratory movement, with headache, burning and heaviness.
57-58. In the emaciated condition of the consumptive patients, indulgence in irregular diet causes the expectoration of blood. The Kapha too being provoked and accumulated is expectorated from the throat. Owing to obstruction in the hematic circulation, the blood does not nourish the flesh and other body-elements. The blood staying in the stomach, getting agitated owing to increased quantity, passes to the throat.
59. Owing to the obstruction of the Vata and the Kapha in the chest, there occurs dyspnea, and the gastric fire being impaired by the morbid humors, the patient passes frequent loose and slimy stools.
60. Anorexia or dislike for food is caused by the morbidity of one or all the three humors in the tongue or the stomach or by disgusting mental perceptions.
61. By the astringent, bitter or sweet taste in the mouth, anorexia is to be diagnosed as born of Vata, Pitta or Kapha respectively, and anorexia due to mental aversion is recognised by the hateful sights be has seen
62. Vomiting is caused by anorexia, the fit of coughing, the precipitation of morbid humors as also by fear; it occurs as a complication of other diseases too.
Its tri-discordant origin and treatment
63. All types of consumption [yakshma] are born of humoral tridiscordance and hence the physician should treat the patient after examining the degree of intensity of the morbid humors and the strength of the patient.
64. Now listen to the description of the various methods of general treatment in coryza, headache, cough, dyspnea, asthenia of the voice and pleurodynia.
65-66. In coryza sudation, inunction, inhalation, application, affusion, bath, cooked barley and barley gruel, meatjuices of quail, partridge, cock and Vartaka quail prepared with salt, acid, pungent, hot and unctuous articles, should be given.
67-67½. The patient should drink the meat-juice of the goat prepared with long pepper, barley, horse-gram, dry ginger, pomegranate or emblic myrobalan and unctuous articles. By taking this, the hexad of coryza and other disorders disappear.
68-68½. The patient should be treated with the homologous diet out of the soups made up of radish or horsegram or out of the staple food made of barley, wheat or Shali rice.
69-70. And the potion of the clear supernatant part of the ‘Varuni’ wine or water prepared with pentaradices, or with coriander and dry ginger or with featherfoil, or with the tetrad of herbs known as ‘Parnis’ is advised. Articles of diet may also be prepared with these decoctions.
71-74.

Nasal medications, inhalations, post-prandial unctuous potions, and inunctions with medicated oils and enemata are also very beneficial.
82. In conditions of pain in the head, side of the chest and the shoulder region, the vitiated blood should be depleted by means of the horn, bottle-gourd, application of leeches or by venesection.
83-86. The application of Himalayan cherry, cuscus grass and sandal wood, with ghee is beneficial: or the application of scutch-grass, liquorice, Indian madder and fragrant poon soaked in ghee; or the application made of tubers of white lotus, chaste tree, red lotus, fragrant poon, blue water-lily, rushnut, and milky yam with ghee. Inunction with the compound sandal oil or the hundred times washed ghee and affusion with milk or liquorice-water are recommended. Affusion with cold rain-water or the decoction of the drugs of the sandal wood group, should be given. Thus has the sedative treatment been described.
87. Mild emesis and purgation, which do not cause emaciation, mixed with sufficient unctuous articles, are recommended for those in whom there is excessive morbidity, after preliminary preparation of the patients with oleation and sudation procedures.
88. The emaciated man (consumptive) suffers death even on the loss of the fecal element. What need then be said of what happens if he is purged to a degree beyond his tolerance?

Summary
Here are the two recapitulatory verses—
193. Concerning consumption, the primogenesis, etiological factors, and premonitory symptoms have been described in brief and treatment in extenso.
191. Explanation of the name of the disease, incurable, curable and formidable conditions; these comprise the complete synopsis of the chapter on the ‘therapeutics of Consumption’.
8. Thus, in the Section on Therapeutics in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the eighth chapter entitled ‘The Therapeutics of Consumption [raja-yakshma-cikitsa]’ is completed.
General Etiology etc.
4. Diet that consists of articles that are incompatible, vitiated and unclean; disrespect towards the gods, teachers and the twice-born; mental shock resulting from excess of fear or joy; and faulty bodily activity-all these, are the causative factors of insanity.
5. The humors in the body of the weak-minded, getting morbid by the above factors, and, in their turn, vitiating the brain, the seat of intelligence, become localized in the channels of the nervous system and soon derange the function of the mind.
6. Confusion of intellect, extreme fickleness of mind, agitation of the eyes, unsteadiness, incoherence of speech, mental vacuity—these, are the general symptoms of insanity [unmada].
7. An imbecile, who is thus afflicted, is unable to know pleasure from pain and right behaviour or duty. Needless to say, he knows no mental case. Deprived of memory, understanding and his wits, he keeps his mind wavering restlessly.
Origin and classification
8. Insanity which is characterised by such derangement of understanding, mind and memory, is said to be of exogenous and endogenous origins. I shall describe individually the fivefold causation of insanity [unmada] together with symptoms and the treatment.
9. The Vata, getting severely provoked by indulgence in dry, meagre or cold diet, or by excess of purificatory procedure or atrophy of body-element or by fasting and vitiating the brain, which is already overcome with worry etc., soon impairs the understanding and memory as well.
10. The following are the symptoms of insanity arising from provoked Vata: laughing, soiling, dancing, singing, speaking, [??o?ily?] movements and weeping, all of which are out of place; hardness, [???ness] and dusky-red coloration of the skin and the disease in its anabatic phase at the dose of digestion of food
11. The Pitta which has accumulated as the result of taking predigestion meals, or taking pungent, acid, irritant and hot articles of food, being activated and getting lodged in the brain of the undisciplined person, rapidly gives rise, as described before, to acute maniacal symptoms.
12.Intolerance, turbulence, nudity, intimidation, running about, heated condition, anger, craving for shady places and cooling foods and drinks and icteric tinge of the body are the symptoms of insanity due to Pitta
13. In the person of sedentary habits, the Kapha, getting greatly increased in the vital organs as the result of over-feeding, combines with heat and impairs the intellect aud memory, and confounding the mind, causes insanity (Melancholia)
14. Slowness of speech and action, anorexia, fondness for women and solitude, somnolence, vomiting, dribbling of saliva, anabasis following meals, pallor of the nails etc.,—these are the symptoms of insanity due to Kapha.
15. The insanity that is born of tridiscordance is an exceedingly dreadful condition and is caused by the combination of all the etiological factors mentioned above. It accordingly manifests all the symptoms and should be given up as incurable on account of the antagonistic nature of the treatment required.
16. Possession by the gods, sages, Gandharvas, Pishacas, Yakshas Rakshasas, and the manes, and the failure in the proper discharge of observances and vows in this life or the previous one—these, are the causes of the insanity of the exogenous type.
17. The man who evinces superhuman power of speech, valour, prowess and behaviour in respect of knowledge, science and strength, and whose fits of insanity are indefinite as regards time—such a one should be regarded as having the insanity born of spirit-possession.
18. The gods etc., enter invisibly and suddenly into the body of a man by their innate power, without causing any morbid change, just as an image and sunshine enter a looking glass and a crystal respectively.
19. The time of the attacks of spirit-possession and their premonitory symptoms have been described in the Section on Pathology. Now listen to a description of the symptoms of each type of insanity [unmada] due to spirit-possession, its incidence and of the persons who are liable to these spirit-invasions.
Thus one who is of gentle looks, dignified, indomitable, non-irascible, and disinclined for sleep and food, whose excretions, viz., sweat, urine, stools and flatus are scanty, whose body-odor is pleasant and whose face is radiant like a full blown lotus should be known to be insane due to possession by the gods.

One who sleeps, weeps and laughs frequently, is fond of dancing, singing, music, recitation, gossip, food, drinks, baths, garlands, incense and unguents, has blood-shot and tearful eyes, speaks ill of the twice-born and the physicians, and is given to revealing secrets, should be known to be insane due to possession by the Yakshas.
20-(6). One who is afflicted with insomnia, averse to food and drink, exceedingly strong though abstaining from food, fond of weapons, blood, flesh and red-colored garlands, and is minatory, should be known to be insane due to possession by the Rakshasas.
20-(7). One who is conspicuous for his loud guffaws and dance, who evinces hatred and contempt for the gods, the Brahmanas and the physicians, who is given to quoting hymns, scriptural verses and learned treatises and who flagellates himself with sticks and in other ways practises self-mortification, should be known to be insane due to possession by the Brahma-rakshasas.
20. One who is of morbid mentality and finds no resting-place anywhere and is given to dancing, singing and laughter, who talks now sensibly and now at random, shows a penchant for sitting on dung heaps, slag-heaps, roadways, rag-heaps hay-stacks, stones and wood-heaps, who has a voice that is broken aud dry, who likes to be nude, who constantly runs about, never keeps to one place. for any length of time, who loudly proclaims his sorrows, and is devoid of memory—such a one should be known to be insane due topossession by the Pishacas.
21-(1). The gods, finding an opportunity, effect their entry into a man of pure conduct and devoted to austerities and scriptural studies, generally either on the first or the thirteenth day of the. bright fortnight.
21-(2). Similarly, the Rishis enter into a man who is devoted to frequent bathing and cleaning of his person and to solitude, and who is versed in the law-books, scriptures and maxims, for the most part either on the sixth or the ninth day of the fortnight.

21-(7). The Rakshasas and Pishacas enter a man who is of a depraved mentality, given to back-biting, effeminate in character, covetous and deceitful, for the most part on the second, the third or the eighth day of the fortnight.
21. Thus, from among the countless varieties of psychic seizure, we have described the foregoing eight, they being the ones most commonly observed.
Symptoms of incurability
22. From among all these kinds of psychic subjects, one who moved by the intensity of his passion, never hesitates to raise his hand and strikes either himself or those about him is to be regarded as an incurable case. Similarly, one whose eyes are marked with profuse lachrymation, who bleeds in the phallus, has his tongue bruised, nostrils dilated, skin cracking and his speech unrestrained, is seen to mumble constantly, has discoloration of body, is constantly afflicted with thirst and is foul-smelling, should be known as having been crazed by a Spirit desirous of avenging itself. Such a man should be left to his fate.
Therapeutic Measures
23. As regards those who have been rendered insane by spirits moved by the desire for sport or for worship, the physician, having ascertained this point by observing the intentions and the behaviour of the subjects, should proceed to treat the patients by the incantation therapy, suitably assisted by means of appropriate propitiatory aud sacrificial offerings.
24. We shall now explain the procedure of treatment of both the endogenous and exogenous types of insanity [unmada] in brief as well as in extenso.
25. The specialist should first give the unctuous potion to a patient with insanity arising from Vata, but if the passages are obstructed, then the oleation should be accompanied with mild purificatory procedure
26. If the insanity [unmada] is due to Kapha or Pitta, then emesis and purgation should be first carried out after preliminary preparation with oleation and sudation. When purified thus, the procedure of rehabilitation should be carried out.
27. After this, the patient should be given evacuative or unctuous enema, or errhine-medications, repeating these measures as often as needed by the intensity of the morbidity.
28. The stomach, the senses, the head and the alimentay [alimentary?] tract being purified by emesis and other purificatory procedures, the mind becomes clear and the patient regains his memory and wits.
29. If even after purification, the disorganized behaviour persists, strong nasal and eye medications, flagellation and giving shock to his mind, intellect and body, are advised.
30. If the patient continues to behave in an irresponsible manner, then he should be made gentle by soft but strong bandages and put into a dark room free from metallic and wooden articles (lest he should harm himself with these).
31. Intimidation, terrorization, coaxing, exhilaration, pacification, frightening and astonishing—these being causative of forgetfulness serve to reclaim the mind to normality from its insane fixation.
32. Applications, massage, inunctions, inhalations and potions of ghee should be used for restoring him to his normal frame of mind, intellect, memory and intelligence,
32½. The potion of ghee and other similar measures, and the incantation-therapy, are recommended in the exogenous variety of insanity.
33 Now listen to a description of the most successful recipes curative of insanity [unmada].

58-59. The patient may be -given a potion of ancint [ancient?] ghee alone or the medicated ghee above described. Being given the maximum dose, he may be locked up in an under-ground cellar or in a house. The physician may administer specially old ghee to the patient. It will be found curative of tridiscordance and being perfectly pure, it is specially curative of spiritpossession.
60-60¾. Its properties and actions are intensified when drunk as a potion, aud it is pungent and bitter in taste. The ghee kept for a period of ten years is called ‘Ancient’ ghee and it possesses very strong odor. The ghee, preserved for a longer period (i.e., for more than ten years) is of the color of lac-juice, cooling and curative of all kinds of possessions. It is highly promotive of the intellect and stands first as a purgative.
61-62½. As regards the ghee preserved for a period of hundred years, there is no disorder which it cannot cure. Even the sight or touch or smell of this ghee is curative of all kinds of spirit-possession. It is specially beneficial in epilepsy and in insanity due to spirit-possession.
63-63½. If the patient proves recalcitrant, the following drugs may be used as eye-salves, massage, applications and nasal medications.
64-64½. Siris, liquorice, asafoetida, garlic, Indian valerian, sweet flag and costus, pounded in goat’s urine make a good nasal and eye medication.
65-65½. Similarly, the three spices, turmeric and Indian berberry, madder, asafoetida, rape seed and siris-seed will be found curative of insanity [unmada], possession and epilepsy.
66-67½. Make a collyrium-stick by pounding equal parts of rough chaff, asafoetida, yellow arsenic, gummy gardenia, with half its quantity of black pepper, in the bile of an ox or jackal. This collyrium-stick should be applied to the eye of epileptic subjects or those afflicted with delusionary insanity, spirit-possession and fever or in cases of persons afflicted by spirits or the gods or in eye-diseases.
68-68½. The collyrium prepared from the paste of black pepper and exposed to the sun for one month should be used in the case of persons who suffer from delusions and loss of memory caused by morbid humors or spirit-possessions.
69-72½. Rape-seed, sweet flag, asafoetida, Indian beech, deodar, madder, the three myrobalans, white mussel shell creeper, bark of white siris, the three spices, perfumed cherry, siris, turmeric and Indian berberry; take equal parts of each and make a paste in goat’s urine. This antidote may be used as potion, collyrium, nasal medication, application, bath or massage. It is curative of epilepsy, toxicosis, insanity [unmada], effects of black magic, poverty and fever. It frees one from the fear of evil spirits and is esteemed by royal persons. Also the ghee prepared of the above articles, in cow’s urine, has similar properties.
73-73½. If the patient is affected with ptyalism or coryza, he may smoke a cigar prepared of drugs of the fragrant group or of the group of the white mussel shell creeper, together with asafoetida mentioned in connection with errhine-smokes.
74-75½. Affusions, eye-ointments and insufflations, nasal medications and smokes may be prepared from urine, bile, dung, nails and hide of pangolin, owl, cat, jackal, wolf aud goat, for use particularly in insanity due to Vata and Kapha-
75½-77. In conditions due to Pitta, the bitter group ghee, Jivaniya ghee, mixed unction and sweet, soft and cooling eats and drinks are recommended. The physician skilled in venesection should take out blood iron the temporal vein situated near the margin of the hair and tempora region in conditions of insanity [unmada], irregular fever and also, epilepsy.
78. Or having fed him to repletion on ghee and flesh, the patient should be confined in a comfortable room free from draught. By this he becomes free from his derangement of intellect and memory and having regained his normal wits, gets rid of his disease.
79. The patient’s well-wishers may calm him with words of religious and moral import, or they may shock him out of his distemper by announcing the news of the loss of something he dearly loves or they may win him back to normality by showing him marvels.
80-81. Or the patient may be anointed with mustard oil and tied hand and foot, laid out on his back in the sun; or he may be smeared with the leaves of cowage, or lightly branded with hot irons or scalded with boiling oil or water, or having scourged him with light whips, he may be left well secured with ropes in solitary confinement. From such drastic measures, the disorientated mind of the man is restored to normality.
82-83 Thus, he may also be terrorised by means of snakes whose fangs have been removed or by trained lions and elephants, or by men dressed as bandits or foemen with weapons in their hands or men impersonating the king’s officers may, having dragged him out securely bound, intimidate him with threats of immediate execution by order of the king.
84. It has been well said that the threat to life is more potent than fear of bodily injury; accordingly that measure may succeed in helping the disordered mind of the insane patient to regain its composure (when all the other measures have failed).
85. The man who has become unhinged in his mind as the result of losing something that he dearly loved, should be consoled by the proffer of a substitute and by words of sympathy and comfort.
86. As regards the mental derangement resulting from an excess of desire, grief, delight, envy or greed, it should be allayed by bringing the influence of its opposite passion to bear on the prevailing one and neutralize it.
Treatment of Spirit-possession
87. In insanities, arising from both spirit-possession and vitiation of the humors, such of the above-mentioned measures should be applied as seem most appropriate after a consideration of the patient’s place of residence, his age, homologation, the nature of the morbidity, the season of the year and their respective strength and weakness.
88-88½. In the case of those who are demented by the gods, the Rishis, the manes and the Gandharvas, the physician should avoid such medicaments as acute collyriums and in general all drastic measures. Instead, he should be treated by means of such mild medications as potions of ghee.
89-90. Worship, sacrifices and libations offered to the gods, incantations and mild collyriums; propitiatory rites and ceremonies; burnt-offerings, prayers, supplications and pilgrimages; observance of the vows laid down in the scriptures and expiatory acts—all these too, may be performed.
91. By worshipping daily, with true devotion, God Ishvara, the lord of the spirits and the ruler of the world, one gets free from the fear of insanity [unmada].
92. A man is freed from insanity by performing, likewise, the worship of the angelic hordes of Rudra going by the name of Pramathas, who wander about in the world (on Rudra’s errands).
93-94. The exogenous type of insanity is said to abate by means of sacrifices, auspicious rites, burnt offerings, wearing of magical herbs and talismans, observance of truthfulness, customary rites and austerities, by recourse to knowledge, charity, right discipline and vows, by propitiating the gods, cows, Brahmanas and the teachers, as well as by recourse to proved charms and medicines.
95. Moreover, whatever therapeutic measures are recommended in connection with epilepsy, are also applicable in the case of insanity, since in both, the etiological and the susceptible factors are the same.
96. The man of strong mind, who abstains from flesh and alcohol, observes a wholesome diet and is always dutiful and pure, will never fall a victim to insanity, whether exogenous or endogenous.
Signs of Cure
97. The signs of a man who has fully recovered from insanity [unmada] are—clarity of sense-faculties and sense perceptions as well as of the understanding, the spirit and the mind and the normal condition of the bodyelements.
Summary
Here is a recapitulatory verse—
98. The best of physicians (Punarvasu) has set out in this chapter, the pathogenesis. of the various types of insanity due to endogenous and exogenous factors, their signs and symptoms and their treatment.
9. Thug, in the Section on Therapeutics in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the ninth chapter entitled ‘The Therapeutics of Insanity [unmada-cikitsa]’, not being available, the same as restored by Dridhabala, is completed.
Definition
3. The knowers of the medical science define epilepsy [apasmara] as a disease due to the derangement of the intellect and the mind, characterised by loss of memory, loss of consciousness and convulsive movements of the body.
4-5. In those persons in whom the humors have become excessive and deranged by addiction to unwholesome and unclean food, and the Sattva quality has become obscured by passion and ignorance, the brain has become occluded with morbid humors and the mind oppressed with worry, passion, fright, anger, grief, anxiety etc., epilepsy makes its manifestation.
6-7½. The morbid humors lodged in the vessels affecting the brain, cause disturbance in its function; aud the person thus affected is overpowered with stupor and derangement of mind. He sees imaginary things, i.e., has visual aura, and drops down suddenly and is afflicted with tremors; his eyes and eye-brows become distorted; foam issues from the mouth, and the hands and feet become convulsed. When the paroxysm is over, he regains consciousness as though he were waking from sleep.
Varieties and Symptoms
8. Epilepsy [apasmara] is considered to be of four kinds: three of them being due to each of the humors separately and the fourth to the discordance of all three combined..
9. In an epileptic fit due to Vata there is visual aura of forms which are hard and of dusky-red or black color; the patient trembles, gnashes his teeth, throws out foams from the mouth and pants.
10. In a fit of epilepsy due to Pitta, the patient’s saliva, limbs, mouth and eyes have an icteric tinge; he sees the visual aura of yellow or red color and is affected with thirst and heat and visualizes the whole world as being in flames.
11. In a fit of epilepsy due to Kapha, the saliva, limbs, mouth and eyes are white, the body is cold, horripilated and heavy; the patient sees visual aura of white shapes and takes a long time to recover from the fit.
Sips of incurability
12. If accompanied with all the symptoms in all their intensity, the epilepsy [apasmara] should be known as being produced by the tridiscordance of all the three humors. This type is incurable; so also is the epilepsy which occurs in debilitated persons or which is of. long standing.
13. The provoked morbid humors precipitate an attack of epilepsy once every fortnight, every twelve days or every month, the paroxysm lasting for a brief period.
Treatment
14. The physician should bring about the restoration of the activity of the brain, nerves and mind, which have been occluded by the above factors, by first administering the drastic purificatory measures.
15. the physician should treat the Vata-type of epilepsy mainly by means of enemata, the Pitta-type mainly by purgation, and the Kapha-type mainly by emesis.
16. Now listen to a description of the sedative recipes given for the cure of epilepsy, after the patient has been fully purified and well comforted.
17. The patient may take the ghee prepared with equal parts of cowdung-juice, sour curds, milk and cow’s urine. This ghee is curative of epilepsy [apasmara], jaundice and fever. Thus has been described ‘The Pancagavya Ghee’.

Decoct in 1024 tolas of water 8 tolas of each of the two varieties of pentaradices, three myrobalans, turmeric, Indian berberry, kurchi bark, dita bark, rough chaff, indigo, kurroa, purging cassia, root of common fig, orris root and cretan prickly clover, and when it is reduced to one-fourth its quantity, add the paste of one tola each of beetle-killer, Patha, the three spices, turpeth, hijjal, elephant pepper, pigeon pea, trilobed virgin’s bower, wild croton, wild chiretta, white flowered lead wort, the two varieties of Indian sarsaparilla, ginger grass, bishops weed and henna; cook with this 64 tolas of ghee, adding equal quantities of cow-dung-juice, sour curds, milk and urine. This ghee is called the major Pancagavya Ghee. It is equal to ambrosia.
23-24. it is recommended for use in epilepsy, insanity, edema, abdominal diseases, Gulma, piles, anemia, jaundice and Halimaka. It should be taken every day. It dispels ill luck, spirit possession and quartan fever. Thus has been described The major Pancagavya Ghee’.
25. The medicated ghee prepared of ancient ghee in Brahmi juice with sweet flag, costus and kidney-leaved ipomea, is curative of insanity, ill-luck, epilepsy [apasmara] and effects of evil deeds.
26. The medicated ghee, prepared with four times its quantity of the urine of the bull, or the he-goat, together with rock salt and asafoetida, is curative of the diseases of epilepsy and cardiac seizure.
27. The medicated ghee prepared with the paste of sweet-flag, purging cassia, curry neem, guduch, asafoetida, angelica and gum guggul is beneficial in epilepsy due to Vata-cum-Kapha.
28, The mixed unction, prepared of 64 tolas of oil and 64 tolas of ghee in 1024 tolas of milk, with the paste of four tolas of each of the drugs of the life-promoter group, is curative of epilepsy.
29-30. A medicated ghee may be prepared of 64 tolas of ghee in 256 tolas of milk and sugarcane-juice and eight times the quantity of decoction of white teak, with the paste of one tola each of the drugs of the life promoter group. By the use of this ghee, the epilepsy born of Vata-cum-Pitta is soon subdued. Similar is the action of the medicated ghee prepared in the decoction of thatch-grass, white yam, sugarcane and small sacrificial grass.
31. The medicated ghee prepared of 64 tolas of ghee in 1024 tolas of juice of emblic myrobalans, with the paste of 8 tolas of liquorice, is similarly curative of epilepsy [apasmara] due to Pitta.
Medicated inunctions
32. Inunction should be given with the rape-seed oil prepared in four times its quantity of goat’s urine; massage should be done with cow’s dung and bath with cow’s urine.,
33. The oil, prepared in the decoction of the bark of white siris, neem, tree of heaven and drumstick with equal amount of cow’s urine, is recommended for inunction.
34-36.

37-38. Long pepper, rock-salt, physic-nut, asafoetida, white emetic nut, Kakoli, rape-seed, small stinking swallow wort, curry neem and sandal and bones of the shouldergirdle, nails and ribs of dog—all these should be pounded together in goat’s urine under the constellation of Pushya. This will make a good application and fumigation.
39.The massage should be given with the paste of holy basil, costus, chebulic myrobalan Putana-keshi and angelica, ground in cow’s urine; and urines may also be used by themselves as affusion.
40. Similarly massage should be given with the excrement of leeches or burnt hair of goat or burnt bones of the ass, or burnt nails of the elephant or the burnt hair of the cow’s tail.
41. The urine of a tawny cow is very beneficial as a nasal medication, also the urine of dog, jackal, cat, lion and other creatures of that group is also recommended for nasal medication.
42-42½. (1) Beetle-killer, sweet flag, oblong-leaved croton; (2) white flowered mussel-shell creeper and climbing asparagus; (3) staff plant and oblongs leaved croton—these three sets of drugs, one mentioned in each hemistich, should be pounded with cow’s urine; the physician may use five or six drops of these as nasal drops.

52. With the application of these tried procedures, the centre of consciousness is re-activated and the body channels become purified and the person is restored to consciousness.
53.If the condition of the endogenous epilepsy [apasmara] is attended with a sequela of the exogenous type characterised by excessive morbidity and symptoms, the treatment consists of measures indicated in insanity due to exogenous origin.
54-55. On the conclusion of the above, Agnivesha with folded hands, made the following submission: ‘Your Holiness, in the Section on General Principles, mention was made of psychic perversion or delusion and it was called the Great Disease. As, however, its causes, manifestation and treatment were not indicated there, I am left with the desire to know them. Will Your Holiness describe them now?’
56. Hearing these words of the disciple, eager for knowledge, Punarvasu said to him, ‘O! gentle one, listen to me as I describe this Great Disease, together with its causes, manifestation and treatment.
57-60. In the body of the man whose spirit is clouded with passion and delusion and who is given to impure diet and conduct and to the suppression of natural urges, the humors, getting irritated by the excessive and promiscuous indulgence in things cold and hot, unctuous and dry etc., get localised in the brain and vitiate the pathway of the mind and understanding. Under such conditions, with the mind and understanding clouded by the increase of passion and delusion, and the brain disturbed by the rampant humors, the man, grown stupid and weakened in intelligence, tends to formulate erroneous judgments concerning the true and the false,the wholesome and the unwholesome. Such a state of mind is referred to by the experts as ‘Delusion’ and ‘Great Disease’.
61. The victim of this disorder should first be subjected to oleation and sudation and then purified by means of emesis and purgation When his strength has been rehabilitated, he should be nourished with foods and drinks that serve as brain-tonics.
62. He should take the Pancagavya ghee already described mixed with the expressed juice of Brahmi or small-leaved convolvulus or other vitalizing preparations that are pro-motive of intelligence.
63. In addition, his friends, sympathizers and trusted mentors who can expound to him both his moral and material good, should instill into him understanding, resolution, memory and concentration.
Elixirs
64. He may also use garlic in conjunction with til oil, climbing asparagus with milk and the juice of Brahmi or costas, or sweet flag with honey.
65. The disease of epilepsy [apasmara] if it has become chronic and has obtained a firm footing is indeed very intractable. It should be treated for the most part by means of vitalization therapy.
Warning
66. The epileptic as well as the insane should be specially protected from water, fire and trees, mountains and irregular surfaces, since these may become the cause of immediate death to such persons.
Summary
Here are the two recapitulatory verses—
67-68. The etiological factors, how the morbid humors being provoked produce the causative factors of epilepsy [apasmara], the general and special symptoms of these morbid humors together with their treatment, the pathogenesis of the Morbid us Magnus, its manifestation and-treatment—all this, the sage (Punarvasu) has set forth both in outline and in detail, in this chapter on the Therapeutics of Epilepsy.
10. Thus, in the Section on Therapeutics in the treatise compiled Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the tenth chapter entitled ‘The Therapeutics of Epilepsy [apasmara-cikitsa]’ not being available, the same as restored by Dridhabala, is completed.
Etiology
4-8 One who strains excessively with the bow, lifts heavy loads, falls from uneven heights and up the steep gradients, fights with stronger men, tries to restrain a young run-away bull, horse or other animal requiring control, or in assaults with foemen heaves boulders or wields clubs or powerful slings, or one who is given to reciting at the top of his voice, or runs a long course at top speed or swims across great rivers, or runs along keeping pace with swift horses, or performs violent feats of high or long jumping, or dances overmuch and at a rapid pace, or one who is injured by similar violent activities, or is addicted to excessive indulgence in women or is habituated to dry, meagre and poor diet—in such a person, the ulcerative lesions having occurred in the chest, this severe disease supervenes.
9-11½. He suffers from acute pain in his chest and ulcerative lesions form aud spread in the lungs. The side of the chest is compressed, atrophied and sunken and the pulsating movement is seen there (marked cardiac gustation). Thereafter gradually vitality, strength, complexion, appetite and digestive power become diminished and also, as a consequence of the loss of gastric fire, there occur fever, pain, neurasthenia and looseness of stools. The patient suffering from cough expectorates sputum which is purulent, dark, offensive in smell, yellow, nummular, copious and tinged with blood. Thus, the patient with pectoral lesions [kshata] becomes excessively emaciated; and so does the man who suffers undue loss of semen and vital essence
12. The indistinct signs are said to be the premonitory symptoms.
13. Pain in the chest, hemoptysis and particularly cough appear in pectoral ulcerative lesions. In cachexia [kshina], there will be hematuria and rigidity of the side of the chest, back and waist
14. The disease which manifests only a few symptoms, which is of recent origin and occurs in a person who is strong and whose gastric, fire is powerful, is curable. If the disease has been existing for more than a year, it is palliable and if it is accompanied with all the symptoms it is irremediable.
15. Once a diagnosis of ulcerative lesions in the chest has been made, the patient should be immediately made to drink a draught prepared of lac, mixed with milk and honey. He may take his meal mixed with milk and sugar.
16- 17. If the patient has pain in the side or the hypogastric region, or
the Pitta and the gastric fire are feeble, this dose should be given with Sura wine; and if he suffers from loose-stools, then the draught of lac should be given mixed with nutgrass, atees, Patha and kurchi seeds. If the gastric fire of the patient is strong he should take this dose of lac mixed with ghee, bees’ wax, the drugs of the life-promoter group, sugar, bamboo manna and wheat-flour, prepared in milk.
18, The patient with pectoral lesions [kshata] may take milk, prepared with sugar-cane, lotus rhyzomes, lotus anthersand red sandalwood and mixed with honey for the healing of these lesions.
19 If the patient suffers from fever and burning, he may be given barley-powder prepared with milk and mixed with ghee; or he may take roasted barley powder with sugar, honey and milk.
20. If the patient suffers from cough and pains in the side of the chest or in the bones, he may lick the powder prepared of mahwa flowers, liquorice, grapes, bamboo manna, long pepper and sida, mixed with ghee and honey.
21-24. Take ½ tola each of small cardamom, cinnamon leaf and cinnamon, 2 tolas of long pepper and 4 tolas each of sugar, liquorice, dates and grapes. Pulverise them and mixing the whole with honey, make it into pills. The person may take these pills daily in a dose of one tola. This pill will cure cough, dyspnea, fever, hiccup, emesis, fainting, intoxication, giddiness, hemoptysis, thirst, pleurodynia, anorexia, consumption, splenic disorders, rheumatic condition, alteration of voice, pectoral lesions, cachexia [kshina] and hemothermia. This pill is also highly nourishing and aphrodisiac. Thus has been described ‘The compound Cardamom Pill’.
Some Recipes in hemorrhage
25. If there is profuse bleeding, the patient may take a potion of the hen’s egg mixed with gruel or water or he may take the contents of the sparrow’s egg or the blood of the goat or a Jangala animal.
26-26½. The person spitting blood may take the powder of hogweed, red Shali-rice and sugar prepared with grape-juice, milk and ghee. Or he may take the amaranth-vegetable prepared with mahwa-flowers, liquorice and milk.
Remedies in claudicated Vata and Pectoral lesions [kshata]
27. If the patient is afflicted with claudication of Vata, he may take goat’s fat fried in Sura wine with a little of rock-salt.
28. If the patient with pectoral lesions is very weak and cachectic and is suffering from insomnia and if his Vata morbidity is strong, he may take goat’s fat with the top layer of cream of boiled milk with honey, ghee and sugar.
29. Or the emaciated and cachectic pthisis-patient may lick sugar, powder of baked barley, wheat, Jivaka, Rishabhaka and honey, followed by a potion of boiled milk.
30. The patient may drink the soup of the flesh of carnivorous animals, seasoned with ghee and mixed with long pepper and honey. This is a great promoter of flesh and blood.
31-32. The patients suffering from pectoral lesions and paucity of semen should be given cooked Sail rice with ghee prepared from the milk decocted with banyan fig, gular fig, holy fig, yellow-barked fig, Indian sal, perfumed cherry, the tuft of the palm, the bark of the jambul, buchanan’s mango, Himalayan cherry and the Ashvakarna sal.
33. The medicated ghee prepared in the decoction of liquorice and gingo fruit, and an equal quantity of milk with the paste of milky yam, long pepper and bamboo manna, is beneficial in pectoral lesions [kshata].
34. Similarly the medicated ghee prepared in the solution of jujube and lac, and milk eight times the quantity of ghee, together with the paste of the barks of Indian calosanthes, Indian berberry, kurchi and kurchi seeds, is beneficial in pectoral lesions.
35-41.

When it is cooled, mix it with 32 tolas of honey, 200 tolas of sugar and the powder of 2 tolas of each of cinnamon leaf, small cardamom, fragrant poon, cinnamon and black pepper. The patient may lick this Amrita-prasha ghee—ambrosial linctus in proper dose, which acts as ambrosia on men. A man taking the milk and meat-juice should take this nectarial or ambrosial ghee.
42-43. This ghee will act as a roborant on persons emaciated from loss of semen, pectoral lesion, cachexia [kshina], debility and diseases, those who resort to over-indulgence in women, those who are emaciated and also those who have lost their complexion and voice. It is curative of cough, hiccup, fever, dyspnea, burning, thirst, hemothermia, emesis, fainting, stomach-disorders, gynecic and urinary disorders and it promotes procreative power. Thus has been described ‘The Amrita-prasha Ghee’.
44-47. Decoct 4 tolas of each of small caltrops, cuscus grass, Indian madder, heart-leaved sida, white teak, ginger grass, roots of sacrificial grass, painted leaved uraria,palas, Rishabhaka and ticktrefoil, till it is reduced to one-fourth of its quantity, and prepare a ghee in this solution by adding 64 tolas of ghee, four times the quantity of milk and the paste of cowage, cock swallow wort, Meda, Rishabhaka, Jivaka, climbing asparagus Riddhi, grapes, sugar, east indian globe thistle and lotus stalks. This ghee is curative of disorders of Vata and Pitta, tachycardia, colic, dysuria, urinary disorders, piles, cough, consumption and wasting and is promotive of strength and flesh in persons emaciated as the result of overstrain, practising the bow, over-indulgence in women and wine, and carrying of heavy loads and of the fatigue due to excessive walking. Thus has been described ‘The compound small Caltrops Ghee’.
48-49. Take 32 tolas of liquorice and 64 tolas of dried grapes and to the decoction obtained from these, add 64 tolas of ghee and 32 tolas of the paste of long pepper, and cook. After it has been taken off the fire and allowed to cool, add 32 tolas each of honey and sugar. This medicated ghee taken with equal quantity of fried barley flour is beneficial in cases of pectoral lesions [kshata] and cachexia [kshina] and Gulma due to vitiated menstrual blood.
50-53. The physician should take 64 tolas each of the following seven articles: juices of chebulic myrobalan, white yam, sugar cane, drugs of the life-promoter group, ghee, goat’s milk and cow’s milk, and should cook the whole together- After it has been allowed to cool, add 64 tolas each of sugar candy and honey. This medicated ghee is curative of consumption, epilepsy, hemothermia, cough, urinary disorders and wasting. It is also rejuvenating and promotive of life, and promotes flesh, semen and vitality. Ghee should be taken in the form of linctus in conditions where Pitta is predominant; and where Vata is predominant it should be taken in the form of a potion. When used as a Ii^ctus^ the dose being small it quiets the Pitta without quenching the gastric fire; when used as a potion (the dose being large) it subdues Vata, while also preventing the diffusion of the gastric fire.
Ghee-bolus
54-55. All these ghees made into a thick paste with the powders of bamboo manna, sugar and roasted paddy powder, may be used for persons who are weak, emaciated and thin. The patient may take this medicated ghee rolled into balls, with the addition of equal quantity of honey. It should be followed by a potion of milk. By a course of this, one obtains increase of semen, vitality, strength and plumpness at a quicker rate. Thus have been described preparation of the ghee bolus.
56 61. Take four tolas each of heart leaved sida, white yam, minor pentaradices, hog-weed and sprouts of- the five milk-yielding trees (viz., the five varieties of fig). To the decoction obtained from these, add twice its quantity of milk and an equal quantity of the juice of white yam and the meat-juice of goat’s flesh, one tola of the paste of each of the ten drugs of the life-promoter group and 256 tolas of ghee. Cook the whole together. After it has cooled, filter and add 128 tolas of sugar-candy and 16 tolas each ot the powder of wheat, long pepper, bamboo manna, Indian water chestnut and honey; The whole should be beaten up into the consistency of a paste by means of a wooden stick and rolled into balls. These ghee-balls should be wrapped round in birch leaves. This preparation should be taken in a dose of 4 tolas and followed by a potion of milk or in the case of Kapha disorders, by a potion of wine. These ghee-balls are recommended in the disorders of consumption, cough, pectoral lesions [kshata], wasting, emaciation due to overwork, indulgence in women and carrying of heavy weights, in hemoptysis, in heat or colds affecting the chest, in pain in the sides of the chest or in the head and in loss of voice and complexion.

Regimen
93-94. Whatever food and drink is nourishing, cooling, non-irritant, wholesome and light should be taken by the patient who suffers from cachexia [kshina] due to pectoral lesions [kshata], and who is desirous of regaining health. Whatever has been described as wholesome to the patient suffering from consumption, cough and hemothermia, may be used for the patient with pectoral lesions, with due consideration to gastric fire, intensity of disease, homologation and vitality of the patient.
Prompt attention
95. If prompt treatment of this disease is neglected, it will lead to the sequela of consumption. Therefore before consumption sets in, this disease should be quickly subdued.
Summary
Here are the two recapitulatory verses—
96-97. The etiology of pectoral lesions [kshata] with cachexia [kshina], the general and special signs and symptoms, the incurable, palliable and curable conditions of the disease, and the remedies for those conditions which are curable—all this, has been declared to his foremost disciple by Punarvasu, the knower of Truth, who was free from the faults of passion and ignorance, in this discourse on the therapeutics of Pectoral Lesions and Cachexia.
11. Thus, in the Section on Therapeutics in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the eleventh chapter entitled ‘The Therapeutics of Pectoral Lesions and Cachexia [kshata-kshina-cikitsa]’ not being available, the same as restored by Dridhabala, is completed.
Etiology
5-6. Habitual use of alkali, acid, acute, hot and heavy articles of diet, the constant use of curds, raw articles, earth, vegetables, antagonistic and unwholesome things and food that has been mixed with poison, by persons who are emaciated and weak as a result of the purificatory procedure, disease or fasting, piles, inactivity, not taking the seasonal purificatory procedure, trauma to vital organs or of abnormal labour in women and wrongful administration of purificatory procedures—all these, are considered to be the internal factors of endogenous edema.
7-(1). The cause of exogenous edema [shvayathu] is the superficial injury of the skin by trauma caused by a stick, stone, weapon, fire, poison or metallic and other similar articles.
7. The endogenous type of edema is of three kinds, affecting either the entire body, or half the body or only one limb or region of the body.
8. When the morbid Vata, having reached the peripheral vessels, vitiates the Kapha, the blood and the Pitta, and getting obstructed by them tries to spread in the body, it causes edema with its pathognomic symptom of swelling.
9. If the morbid humor is lodged in the upper part, it causes edema [shvayathu] of the upper region of the body; if it is lodged in the region of Vata, it causes the edema of the lower part of the body. If it is lodged in the middle region, there occurs edema in the middle part; if it affects the entire body, then it causes edema of the whole body; and if it is lodged in one limb only, then local edema occurs. Edema is named after the particular region which it affects.
10-(1). Heat, burning and dilatation of vessels are indeed the premonitory symptoms of edema.
10. All kinds of edema [shvayathu] are due to humoral tridiscordance. Each is named after the predominant humor and symptoms in that tridiscordance, and the line of treatment is to be decided according to its classification.
General Symptoms
11. Heaviness, variability of edema, swelling, beat, thinning of the vessels, horripilation and discoloration of the skin are said to be the general symptoms of edema.
Vata-type
12. Variability, thinness of the skin, roughness, dusky-brown color of the skin numbness, horripilation accompanied with pain, spontaneous disappearance, on being pressed with finger returning soon to normal appearance, greater intensity during day—all these, are the characteristics of edema [shvayathu] due to Vata.
Pitta type
13. Softness, odor, dark-yellow or red coloration, association of giddiness, fever, perspiration, thirst, intoxication, burning, tenderness to touch, injected eyes, great burning and tendency to suppuration—these are the characters sties of edema due to Pitta.
Kapha-type
14.Heaviness, constancy, association of pallor and anorexia, ptyalism, somnolence, emesis, weakness of gastric fire, slowness in appearance and disappearance and pitting on being pressed with finger and not returning immediately to normal appearance, and aggravation at night—these are the characteristics of edema due to Kapha.
15. The edema [shvayathu] affecting the person whose body has been emaciated and weakened by disease or the edema which is accompanied with complication of the list of disorders beginning with vomiting (Chap. XVIII Sūtra) or the edema which has spread into the vital regions or in which profuse discharge is oozing, or which has spread into the entire body in a debilitated man, destroys the patient.
16. The edema occurring in a person who is strong and not wasted of flesh, with only one morbid humor in preponderance or which is of recent origin, is easily curable. The physician skilled in the knowledge of strength, morbidity and proper time of treatment, should treat it on the lines of treatment antagonistic to the etiological morbidity and season.
Line of Treatment
17-19. The edema [shvayathu] born of chymedisorder, should be treated with depletion procedure and digestive medication and that due to preponderance of morbid humor with purificatory procedures. The edema localised in the head should be treated by errhines; if it is lodged in the lower part of the gastro-intestinal tract, then by purgation; if in the upper part of the gastro-intestinal tract, then by emesis; if the edema is due to increase of viscous element in the body, it must be treated by dehydrating procedures; if the condition is due to dehydration, then by oleation procedure. In condition of scybalous stools due to Vata, it must be treated by evacuative enema; if it be due to Pitta-cum-Vata, then it should be treated with ghee medicated with bitter substances; if the patient is affected with fainting, apathy, burning and thirst, and needs purification, milk should be given mixed with cow’s urine. If the edema is due to Kapha, it should be subdued by the use of alkalis or pungent and hot articles mixed with cow’s urine, butter-milk and wine in the proper measure.
Contraindications
20. Indulgence in the flesh of domestic, aquatic and wet-land animals which are weak, in dried vegetables, fresh grains, products of gur, articles made of flour, curds, products of til, viscous articles, wine, acid articles, roasted barley, dried flesh, mixture of wholesome and unwholesome articles, heavy, unwholesome and irritant articles, day-sleep and sexual act, should be avoided by one suffering from edema.

External Remedies
64. Thus has been described the procedure of internal medication. Now listen. as I describe the medications for external use which are beneficial to edema-patients. If the Vata is very powerful, then oleation, application, affusions and sudation should be done.

68. In Pitta-condition, the medicated nil prepared of cane and the barks of milk-exuding trees, Indian mudar, scutch grass, lotus stalk, sandal wood and Himalayan cherry, should be used as application.
69. After taking inunction with this oil, bathing with the water medicated with sandal-wood, fragrant sticky mallow and Himalayan cherry and heated by the sun’s rays, is beneficial; or the decoction of milky trees as well as milk and water are good for bath; and the anointment of the body with sandal-wood paste is also beneficial.

Partial Edemas
74. The swellings affecting one limb or one region of the body of multiple variety owing to the different classifications of them according to site, susceptibility of the bodyelement, shape and name. Listen to the description of a few of them that I give for the purpose of illustration.
75. All the three humors, being provoked by their respective etiological factors, produce [? frightful?] inflammation of the head (cellulitis of head or skull) When it affects the inside of the throat it causes ‘Shaluka [śālūka]’ or quinsy which is accompanied with stertorous breathing (quinsy or acute inflammation of the tonsils) or with fever.
76. The acute inflammation, occurring in the regions of the chin, neck and in between then along with redness and burning and impairment of the respiration and attended with intense pain, is called Bidalika [biḍālikā] (ludwig’s angina) inflammation. It kills the patient if folds are formed on the throat.
77. That is Talu-vidradhi (palatal abscess) wherein occurs the abscess and suppuration due to tridiscordance. That which affects the superficial part of the tongue is called Upajihvika (acute superficial glossites) and when owing to Kapha the sublingual part is affected, it is called Adhijihvika (sub-lingual abscess).
78. Due to vitiation of blood and Pitta where there is suppuration in the gums, it is called Upakusha (Gingivitis). There may be dental abscess also if the gums are swollen owing to the accumulation of Kapha and blood.
79.If there is a single swelling on the side of the neck, it is called Galaganda and if there are many, it is called Gandamala or a ‘chain of tumors’. They are regarded curable but they are incurable if accompanied with coryza, pleurodynea, cough, fever and vomiting,
80. In all these conditions, venesection, purgation, errhines, smoke and the potion of old ghee are prescribed; and in conditions affecting the mouth, starvation, rubbing and mouthwashes are also prescribed.
81.There occur swellings in various parts of the body caused by the morbid Vata and other humors, showing their respective characteristic symptoms. The swelling of the vessels will be of a pulsating type. The swelling of the adipose tissue will be excessively unctuous and movable-
82. Where it is not suppurated, the patient should take the preliminary purificatory treatment and his tumor should be subjected to sudation. The physician should try to dissolve it away with a stone or a wooden apparatus or with the manipulation of the thumb or of a rod. Then the physician should cut it open and take it out with its capsule, and cauterizing it, should treat it like a regular wound.
83-85. If imperfectly cauterized, or if some portion of the tumor is left out in the wound, it generally begins to slowly grow again. Thereafter, the skilful surgeon, keeping in view the regional anatomy, should freely open from all sides and remove the tumor completely. If some portion is yet left behind, it will suppurate and slough and from this will start the spreading affection born of this ulcerating surface. The medical specialist considering the complications, should first try to cure it by the appropriate remedies described previously, with great care; and then the specialist skilled in the treatment of wounds, should quickly treat it in the prescribed manner, following the appropriate line of treatment.
86. The tumor situated in the lumbar region, or the abdominal region or in the throat or in the vital regions, should be regarded as not admitting of treatment as also the tumors which are big and indurated and which occur in children, the aged and the weak.
87. There is no special difference in the characteristics between the localised swelling and tumor, regarding the site, causative factor, shape, morbidity of humor and susceptibility of tissues. Therefore, the specialist in tumors should treat the tumor with the same treatment as the one applied in the case of localised swellings.
88, There is also a variety of swelling where there appear copper-colored and painful eruptions attended with discharge from their mouths. There is a variety of swelling which occurs under the nails which, without destroying the skin, vitiates the flesh and the blood, and suppurates severely and acutely (whitlow).
89-89½. That is called ‘Vidarika’ swelling which is accompanied with fever and where there is painless cylindrical swelling in the groin and axilla. It is hard and extensive and is born of Kapha-cum-Vata. In such condition the line of treatment should be suitable to the morbid condition i.e. blood-letting or lump-poultices applied to the swelling; and when it is ripe, the treatment should be just as in a regular wound.
90. Those are called ‘Visphotaka’ eruptions which are red and appear on the entire body and are attended with fever and thirst.
91.That is called Kaksha (Herpes-zoster) wherein occur multiple eruptions in the side of the trunk, where the holy thread usually hangs. It is born of Pitta cum-Vata. Whatever other miscellaneous varieties of eruptions there are, either big or small or of moderate size, are all caused by Pitta.
92. Those eruptions of insignificant size that appear on the whole body and are attendant with fever, burning and thirst, itching, anorexia and salivation, are called Romantika and are born of Pitta-cum-Kapha.
93. The line of treatment described in the treatment of acute spreading affections and which is also useful in dermatosis, should be applied here.
94. The ‘Bradhna’ variety is an inguinal and scrotal swelling caused by Vata and other morbid humors. In a type of Bradhna (hernia), the intestine
enters the swelling and goes back frequently. In cases where it is filled with fluid (urine) it is soft; if it consists of fat, it is (elastic) unctuous and hard.
95. The treatment is purgation, inunction, enemata and applications, and when ripened, the usual treatment as in the case of wounds. If there is passage of urine and the swelling is born of Kapha and is suppurated, it should be opened up, cleansed, and sutured like a regular wound.
96. There will be very painful inflammatory swelling by the side of anal orifice owing to parasitic infection or coryza of bone, sexual indulgence, dysentery or owing to the hard contact of horse-back (while riding). It will suppurate and break open and leave a fistula-in-ano.
97. Its treatment consists of purgation, probing and cutting open, and after cleansing the fistula-tract, cauterization with hot oil. If the case is inoperable, it should be cut open by a thread which has been impregnated with caustic medication. And then the treatment is the same as in a regular wound.
98. There will be swelling in the shanks or calf-muscles, spreading from the upper part of the foot, caused by the morbidity of the flesh, Kapha and blood’ This is called ‘Shlipada’ (elephantiasis). Venesection and all the procedures of treatment curative of Kapha are to be applied as also the external application of rape-seed paste.
99. That is the disease called ‘Jalaka-gardabha’ where mildly provoked humors, with predominance of Pitta, cause very acute swelling attended with fever and the thirst and which cause slight suppuration of a sanguinous type.
100. It should always be treated with strong lightening therapy, bloodletting, dehydration, purificatory procedure, courses of the emblic myrobalan and cold applications.
101. Having diagnosed the other kinds of swelling similar in their characteristics by their specific symptoms or characteristics of Vata and other humors, the physician should try to alleviate them by application, incision, excision, cauterization and other appropriate methods of treatment which rectify the morbidity.
102. In trauma, Vata in association with the blood, causes local red swelling in the beginning. It should be treated with medications curative of acute spreading affections and of Vata and vitiated blood. If edema [shvayathu] is caused by poisonous substances, it should be treated with the remedies curative of toxicosis.
Summary
Here is the recapitulatory verse-
103. The three kinds of edema [shvayathu] when classified according to morbid humors; the classification of edema according to its affecting the whole body or half the body, one limb or part of the body; classification into two groups as being due to endogenous and exogenous causes; and the signs, symptoms and the treatment of edema have all been described herein.
12. Thus in the Section on Therapeutics in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the twelfth chapter entitled ‘The Therapeutics of Edema [shvayathu-cikitsa]’ not being available, the same as restored by Dridhabala, is completed.
Etiology and symptoms
9-11. A number of diseases of various kinds occur in men owing to the vitiation of the gastric fire and the increase of morbid matter; but abdominal diseases [udara] in particular result from these factors. When the gastric fire is weak due to the ingestion of impure food, there will not be complete digestion and there will occur accumulation of morbid matter in the body. This morbid matter vitiates the functioning of the Prana, the gastric fire aud the Apana and obstructs the upper and the lower gastro-intestinal channels. Then penetrating between the skin and the flesh and distending excessively the belly, it gives rise to abdominal disease. Listen now to its etiology and signs and symptoms.
12-15. Eating very hot, salt, alkaline, irritant, acid or poisoned food, wrongful procedure of rehabilitation, taking dry, antagonistic and impure diet, emaciation due to splenic disorders, wrongful effects of purification, neglect of the treatment of severe diseases, dehydration, suppression of the natural urges; vitiation of the circulatory channels, chyme-morbidity, shock, over-impletion, obstruction (of the passage of stools) due to piles or hair in the ingested food, ulceration and perforation of the intestines, excessive accumulation of morbidity in the body and sinful acts bring about abdominal diseases; and particularly so in cases where the digestive fire is dull.
16-19. Loss of hunger, very slow digestion of sweet, very unctuous and heavy food, misdigestion of all food ingested, inability to discriminate between the conditions of digestion and. indigestion, intolerance to surfeit-meal, slight edema of the feet, constant loss of strength, shortness of breath even on slight exertion, increase and accumulation of fecal matter due to dehydration and misperistalsis, pain in the pelvic, hypochondriac and iliac regions, Distension increases and becomes painful as if bursting. The stomach distends even on light and scanty diet. There occur the appearance of a network of veins, and the disappearance of the folds of the belly. These are the prodromal symptoms of abdominal diseases [udara].
General symptoms and varieties
20-22. The morbid humors obstructing the channels carrying sweat and water, get accumulated in the abdominal channels and vitiating the Prana and the Apana Vatas and the gastric fire, produce abdominal diseases [udara]. Distension of the abdomen, meteorism, swelling of hands and feet, dullness of the gastric fire, smoothness of the cheeks and emaciation are the symptoms of abdominal disease. Three varieties caused by the morbidity of each individual humor, one variety by tridiscordance, one by splenic disorder, one by obstruction, one by ulcerative condition and one by ascites—these are the eight varieties of abdominal disease. Now listen to the special characteristic symptoms of each of these.
Special symptoms
23-24. The Vata, provoked by dry and scanty food, over-exertion and the suppression of the natural urges, misperistalsis and other emaciating factors, spreads, towards the ilio-lumbar, epigastric, hypogastric and pelvic regions, impairs the gastric fire, agitates and draws out the Kapha and then getting obstructed by it, it takes its resort between the skin and the flesh and thus causes enlargement of the abdomen.
25. Its signs and symptoms are—swelling of the abdomen, hands, feet and scrotum, bursting pain in the abdomen, variability of the increase and decrease in size, colicky pain in the ilio-lumbar regions, misperistalsis, body-ache, pain in the joints, dry cough, emaciation, asthenia, anorexia, indigestion, heaviness in the lower part of the abdomen, stasis of flatus, feces and urine, dusky red coloration of nails, eyes, face, skin, urine and feces. The appearance of a network of prominent thin dark veins, tympanic sound produced on percussion just as on inflated bladder, and the movement of Vata upwards, downwards aud obliquely, accompanied with pain and borborygmus. These are to be known as the signs and symptoms of abdominal disease due to Vata.
26-27. By the use of pungent, acid, salt, very hot and very acute articles of diet, by exposure to fire or predigestion meal or eating on indigested stomach, the pitta gets immediately accumulated. It reaches the habitats of Vata and Kapha and obstructs the abdominal channels and impairs the gastric fire situated in the stomach thus giving rise to abdominal disease [udara].
28. Its symptoms are—burning, fever, thirst, fainting, diarrhea and giddiness, pungent taste in the mouth, greenish or yellowish coloration of nails, eyes, face, skin, urine and feces; the abdominal wall becomes covered with a network of prominent veins and vessels of blue, golden, yellowish greenish and coppery tints. The part has burning pain, great affliction, local heat, the part sweats is softened and soft to the touch and soon suppurates. This is to be known as the abdominal disease of the Pitta type.
29-30. Owing to lack of exercise, to day-sleep, the excessive use of sweet, very unctuous and slimy food, and excessive indulgence in curds, milk and flesh of aquatic and wet-land animals, the Kapha gets provoked and fills up the abdominal passages. The Vata thus being obstructed by the accumulated Kapha, compresses that very Kapha and spreading beyond the intestines, causes abdominal swelling.
31. Its signs and symptoms are heaviness anorexia, indigestion, body ache, numbness, swelling of hands, feet, scrotum and thighs, nausea, sleepiness, cough, dyspnea, pallor of nails, eyes, face, skin, urine and feces. The abdominal wall is covered with a network of prominent veins of pale color, the region becomes heavy, fixed, immovable and hard. That is to be known as the abdominal disease [udara] of the Kapha-type.
32-33. Owing to unwholesome, raw, antagonistic and heavy articles of diet in a person whose digestive fire is weak or unwholesome articles administered by a woman such as menstrual blood, hair, dung, urine, bone or nails, or owing to slow poisoning by poisonous preparations, all the three humors get provoked and gradually accumulate in the body and cause abdominal disease [udara] in man.
34. Its signs and symptoms are—all the characteristics of all the morbid humors in full form are observed. The discoloration characteristic of all these morbid humors are seen in the nails, etc. The abdominal wall shows a network of veins of variegated colors. This is to be known as the abdominal disease [udara] of the tridiscordance type.
Splenic Enlargement
35-36. Owing to the excessive agitation of the body immediately after meals, by riding in carriages or on horse-back, owing to emaciation due to excessive indulgence in the sex-act or in carrying of heavy loads or due to excessive walking, vomiting or disease, the spleen situated in the left hypochondrium subluxates from its normal place and increases in its size or the increased blood formed from the body-nutrient fluid goes in and increases the size of the spleen.
37. The spleen feels hard like a stone in the beginning and gradually increasing gets the shape of tortoise. If neglected, it slowly surrounds and presses the stomach, abdomen and the seat of the gastric fire and thus brings about the enlargement of the abdomen.
38. Its signs and symptoms are—debility, anorexia, indigestion, retention of feces and urine, fainting, asthenia of the limbs, cough, dyspnea, low fever, obstipation, loss of the gastric fire, emaciation, dysgeusia, arthralgia, intestinal wind and colic, Further, the abdominal wall becomes dusky red in color or pigmented or covered with prominent, bluish greenish or yellowish veins. A similar description holds good as regards the enlargement of the liver which is situated in the right hypochondriac region. Owing to the similarity in causes symptoms and treatment, it is comprehended by the description of splenic enlargement. This is to be known as the abdominal disease [udara] due to splenic enlargement.
Anorectal obstruction
39-40. If the gastro-intestinal channel gets obstructed by the accumulation of hair ingested along with the food, or by misperistalsis or by piles or by paralysis of the intestines (volvulus), the Apana Vata gets provoked as a result of this obstruction in its passage and impairs the gastric fire; aud then obstructing the feces, the Pitta and the Kapha, causes the enlargement of the abdomen.
41 Its signs and symptoms are—thirst, burning, fever, dryness of mouth and palate, asthenia of the thighs, cough, dyspnea, prostration, anorexia, indigestion, retention of feces aud urine, distension, vomiting, sternutation, headache, colicky pain in the epigastric, umbilical and pelvic regions, intestinal stasis of Vata, appearance of a network of dark-red and blue veins on the abdomen and of a protuberance mainly above the umbilicus of the shape of the cows tail. This is to be known as the abdominal disease [udara] due to anorectal obstruction.
Perforative peritonitis
42-43. When the intestines are perforated by sand, straw, pieces of wood, bone and thorns, ingested along with the food or when they rupture owing to pendiculation after meals or owing to surfeit-meal, the intestinal content that flows out from this perforation, causes suppurative inflammation and fills up the pelvis and the abdominal cavity thus causing enlargement of the abdomen (perforative peritonitis).
44. Its signs and symptoms are—the protuberance is mainly below the umbilicus i.e. lower half of the abdomen and accumulation of fluid. It manifests signs and symptoms indicative of the nature of the predominant morbid humors. The patient passes stools colored red [???uish] or yellowish and which is [sli????king] and undigested. He is afflicted with hiccup, dyspnea, cough, thirst, urinary disorders, anorexia, indigestion and prostration. This is to be known as abdominal disease [udara] due to perforative peritonitis.
Ascites
45-46. Owing to excessive drinking of water by a person who has just taken internal oleation or whose digestive fire is weak or who suffers from cachexia and pectoral lesions or who is very much emaciated, the gastric fire gets extinguished; and the Vata lodged in the Kloman as well as the Kapha which obstructs the passages, combine together, increase and carry this water from its habitat to the abdomen and thus cause the distension of abdomen.
47 Its signs and symptoms are—inappetence, thirst, discharge from the anus, colic, dyspnea, cough and debility; the abdomen gets covered with a plexus of prominent veins of various colors and gives the sensation on palpation similar to that experienced on touching and agitating a bladder full of fluid (fluctuation and fluid test). This is to be known as the abdominal enlargement due to collection of fluid (ascites).
48. The physician should hasten to treat the condition which is not of long duration, which is not attended with complications, where there is no marked collection of fluid and where the abdominal enlargement has not yet occurred. If neglected, these morbid humors, turned away from their natural habitats, get liquefied as a result of maturation and fill up with fluid, the joints and the abdominal passages. The sweat being obstructed in its external passages gets accumulated, and spreading sideways adds to the fluid already accumulated; when this fluid develops a slimy quality, it causes the abdomen to become round in contour, heavy, firm, producing no resonant sound on percussion, and soft to the touch due the falling away of the abdominal line of hair. After that there is the manifestation of fluid. Its signs and symptoms are [??] great enlargement of the abdomen, [???] [?s?pearance] of the veins, and on palpation and agitation, feeling the same sensation as produced by a bladder full of fluid.
49. At this stage, the following complications develop in the patient viz-, vomiting, diarrhea, asthma, thirst, dyspnea, cough, hiccup, debility, pain in the sides, anorexia, alteration of voice, retention of urine etc. Such a case is to be known as incurable.
Curable and incurable conditions
Here are verses again—
50-51. The physician should regard the abdominal disease [udara] born of Vata, Pitta or Kapha, or of splenic disorder, tridiscordance or of ascites as being increasingly difficult of cure in the successive order of statement. In cases of intestinal obstruction, if a fortnight has elapsed, and similarly in all cases of ascites where marked collection of fluid has occurred, as well as in perforation of intestines, the condition generally leads to death.
52. The patient who suffers from edema of the eyes, crookedness of the genitalia, moist or softened body-skin and loss of vitality, blood, flesh and the gastric fire should not be taken up for treatment.
53. The edema of all the vital regions, dyspnea, hiccup, anorexia, thirst, fainting, vomiting and diarrhea, is fatal to the patient suffering from abdominal disease [udara].
54. All the varieties of abdominal disease from their very inception are considered formidable. But where the patient is a strong person, or the fluid has not accumulated or where the disease is of recent origin, it can be cured by careful treatment.
55-58. Where there is no marked, swelling of the abdomen, where the abdominal wall is dusky-brown in color, where there is tympanitic sounds on percussion, where the condition is not attended with heaviness, where there is a network of veins, where the peristaltic wave going to the rectum returns to the umbilicus and stops there, where there is colicky pain in each of the epigastric regions or umbilical, inguinal, iliac and pelvic regions, where the flatus is voided forcefully and the gastric fire is not very weak, where there is lack of taste in the mouth due to excessive salivation and where the urine is scanty and the feces hardened, diagnosing by the above symptoms that it is a condition where no accumulation of fluid has taken place, the physician, skilled in the knowledge of predominant morbidity, strength and time, should undertake its treatment.
Treatment in Vata type
59.The abdominal disease [udara] of the Vata type in a strong person should first be treated with oleation. After the patient has undergone oleation and sudation, he should be given unctuous purgation.
60. When the morbid matter has been purged out and the abdomen has been retracted, it should be bandaged tightly with a cloth in such a way as not to leave any scope for the Vata to inflate the region again.
61. Owing to excessive accumulation of morbid matter and owing to the obstruction in the passages of the body-channels, abdominal diseases [udara] occur. Hence the patient should be made to undergo purgation daily.
62. After purification, rehabilitation should be done and a potion of milk should be given for increasing his strength. Thus, on the patient getting strong, milkdiet should, be gradually stopped before he develops nausea for it.
63. He should then be given soup or meat-juice mixed slightly with acid and salt, which would stimulate his gastric fire. If he suffers from misperistalsis, he should be again made to undergo oleation and sudation, and be given corrective enema.
64. The patient who suffers from tremors, convulsions and pain in the joints, bones, side of the chest, back and waist, whose digestive fire is active, whose stools and flatus are constipated and who is also dehydrated, should be given unctuous enema.
65. The evacuative enema should consist of the decoction of decaradices mixed with strong purgative drugs; and the unctuous enema should consist of castor oil or til oil prepared with drugs curative of Vata and with acid articles.
66-67. If the patient is unfit for purgation or is weak, aged or a child or delicate by nature or afflicted with slight morbidity, or if the Vata is in excess, the wise physician should treat such a case with sedatives, ghee, soup, meat-juice, cooked rice, enemata, inunctions or unctuous enema and milk.
Treatment in Pitta-type
68. In abdominal disease [udara] of the Pitta type, if the patient is strong, he should be purged in the beginning. But. if he be weak, he should be given unctuous enemata in the beginning and then purged with milk-enema.
69-71. When the patient has gained in strength and body-heat, he should be again oleated and then purged with the milk prepared with the paste of turpeth or the decoction of castor or with that of soap-nut and zalil, or with the decoction of the purging cassia. If the condition is associated with Kapha, this should be given with cow’s urine, and if associated with Vata, it should be given with ghee medicated with bitters. By repeating the course of milk, enemata and purgation, persevering men may gradually subdue the abdominal disease [udara] of the Pitta type.
Treatment of Kapha-type
72. The physician should rehabilitate the patient suffering from abdominal disease [udara] of the Kapha-type after administering him oleation, sudation and purification measures, by means of a Kapha-curative diet mixed with pungent substances and alkali.
73. The physician may alleviate the abdominal disease of the Kapha type by administering cow’s urine, medicated wines, preparations of powdered iron, or potions of oil mixed with alkalis.
Tridiscordance-type
74. In a condition of tridiscordance, all the procedures aforesaid may be carried out, and the condition, attended with complications from the beginning, should not be taken up for treatment by a wise physician.
In Splenic Enlargement
75-76. The physician diagnosing the cause of splenic enlargement by noticing (1) misperistalsis, pain and constipation, (2) burning, fainting, thirst and fever, (3) heaviness, anorexia and hardness, to be the symptoms of Vata, Pitta and Kapha respectively and recognising the condition of vitiation of the blood by its characteristic symptoms, should carry out the treatment to suit the intensity of morbidity in the patient.
77. After careful investigation, the physician should administer oleation, sudation, purgation, evacuative or unctuous enemata or venesection on the left hand.
78. He may be given the ‘Shatpala ghee’ to drink or he may be given a course of long pepper or of chebulic myrobalan with gur, or a course of any of the alkalis or medicated wines, described in the chapter on piles and assimilation disorders.
79-(1). Thus has been described the general line of treatment. Now listen to the various sedative preparations.
Sedative Recipes
79. The patient may take the powder of long pepper, dry ginger, red physic nut, white-flowerd lead wort, embelia and twice the quantity of chebulic myrobalan, with warm water.
80-80½. The patient may take the powder of embelia, white-flowered lead wort, dry ginger, rock-salt and sweet flag, and frying it all with ghee in an earthen pan, should take it with milk. This is curative of Gulma and splenic enlargement.
81-81½. The chopped bits of white cedar should be soaked in the decoction of chebulic myrobalan or cow’s urine for seven days, after which, the decoction is to be taken internally.
82-82½. This cures jaundice, Gulma, urinary anomalies, piles, splenic enlargement, all kinds of abdominal disease [udara] and helminthiasis. After this dose is digested, the diet mixed with the meat-juice of Jangala animals should be taken.
83-84½. Prepare a decoction of hundred tolas of the bark of white cedar and 128 tolas of jujube; prepare 64 tolas of medicated ghee with this adding the paste of 4 tolas of each of the five spices and an equal amount of the paste of the bark of white cedar.
85-85½. This ghee, when taken internally soon diminishes the excessive enlargement of spleen, also Gulma, abdominal disease [udara], dyspnea, worms, anemia and jaundice.
86. The physician should do thermal cauterization if there is predominance of Vata and Kapha.
87. In condition of predominance of Pitta, medicated ghee prepared with the life-promoting group of drugs, milk-enemata, blood-letting, purificatory procedure and potion of milk are recommended.
88-88½. The physician should prepare and give, in splenic abdominal enlargement, light diet mixed with soups or meat-juices and digestivestimulant medication. There being similarity in the conditions of hepatic and splenic disorders, the treatment of the former is the same as that described in the splenic condition.
89-90½. The patient, suffering from intestinal obstruction, should be first made to undergo sudation procedure and then be given evacuative enema prepared of cow’s urine and mixed with acute medications, oil and salt, followed by an unctuous enema, as also laxative diet and strong purgation. The treatment curative of misperistalsis, and Vata may also be administered.
91-91 ½. In a condition of perforation in the abdomen, treatment should be as in the abdominal diseases [udara] of the kapha type, leaving out sudation. The physician should remove the fluid as it accumulates and thus do the palliative treatment.
92-98½. The person afflicted with thirst, cough and fever, whose flesh, gastric fire and diet have diminished and who is suffering from dyspnea, colic and asthenia of all the senses, should be left to himself.
93-93½. In condition of collection of fluid in the abdomen, the physician should give, in the beginning, acute medications combined with cow’s urine and various kinds of alkalis that remove the accumulation of fluid.
94-94½. The patient should be given the diet which is digestive-stimulant and curative of Kapha. Ingestion of liquid diet and water should be restricted gradually.
95-95½. All kinds of abdominal disease [udara] are generally regarded as born of combined humoral discordance, Therefore, in all cases, the procedure of treatment curative of humoral tridiscordance should be done.
96-98½. When the abdomen is full of morbid humors, the gastric fire gets dull. Therefore, foods that are digestive-stimulant and light should be prescribed. Red Shali rice, barley, green gram, the flesh of Jangala beasts and birds, milk, cow’s mine, wines, medicated wines, honey, and Sidhu and Sura wines are wholesome. Gruel and cooked rice may be taken with soup or meat-juice prepared with pentaradices and mixed with articles that are slightly sour, unctuous and pungent.
99-100½ The flesh of aquatic and wet-land animals, vegetables, pastry, til, exercise, way-faring, day-sleep and riding or going on vehicles should be avoided. And again, the patient with abdominal disease should not eat food which is hot, saltish, sour, irritant and heavy and should give up the ingestion of water.
101-101½. Butter-milk which is fresh, from which the butter has been removed and which is not very thick is wholesome as drink. If the patient is affected with the abdominal disease of tridiscordance type, he should take butter-milk mixed with the three spices, alkali and salt.
102-102½. The patient affected with the Vata-type of the disease, may drink butter-milk mixed with long pepper and salt. The patient with the Pitta type of the disease may take fresh butter-milk mixed with sugar and liquorice.
103-103½. If the patient is affected with abdominal disease [udara] of the Kapha type, he may take slightly warm butter-milk which is not very unctuous and is mixed with bishop’s weed, rock salt, cumin seeds, the three spices and honey.
104-105½ If the patient is suffering from splenic disorder, he may take it mixed with honey, oil, sweet flag, dry ginger, dill seeds, costus and rock-salt. The patient with ascitic fluid may take churned butter-milk with the three spices. It the patient is affected with obstruction in the abdomen, he may take it with juniper, bishop’s weed, cumin seeds and rock-salt; and the patient with intestinal perforation may drink butter-milk mixed with long pepper and honey.
106-106½. Butter-milk acts like ambrosia in persons afflicted with heaviness and anorexia, and in those suffering from dullness of the gastric fire and diarrhea as well as in persons afflicted with Vata and Kapha disorders.
Milks, Applications and Affusions
107-107½. Camel’s milk acts similarly in patients afflicted with edema, constipation, colic, thirst and fainting and so do the milks of the goat and the buffalo act in emaciated persons who have undergone purificatory procedure. 108-108½. Application prepared of equal parts of deodar, palas, mudar, elephant pepper, drumstick and winter cherry in cow’s urine may be applied over the abdomen.
109-110. The decoction of climbing nettle mercury; sweet flag, costus, pentaradices, white hog-weed; red hog-weed, dry ginger, and coriander, prepared in water may he used for affusion. Decoction prepared of palas, ginger grass and Indian groundsel may he similarly used for affusion.
111-(1). The physician may use all the eight varieties of urine as affusion and potion for the patient suffering from abdominal disease [udara].
Ghees
111-111½. We shall now describe the various medicated ghees recommended for dehydrated persons, for persons in whom Vata is very pronounced, as well as for persons who desire purificatory treatment, and ghees which act as digestive-stimulants and as curatives of abdominal diseases [udara].
112-114. The medicated ghee prepared from 128 tolas of cow’s ghee in 200 tolas of the. decoction of decaradices and 256 tolas of whey along with the paste of two tolas each of long pepper, chaba pepper, white-flowered leadwort, dry ginger and alkali, is tentative of abdominal diseases [udara] ; it is also curative of edema and intestinal stasis due to Vata, Gulma and piles.
115-115½. The medicated ghee prepared with 64 tolas of the paste of dry ginger and three myrobalans, taken internally, cures all kinds of abdominal-disease and is recommended in Gulma due to Kapha and Vata,
116-117½ The patient suffering from abdominal disease [udara] may drink, mixed with alkli, the medicated ghee prepared of 64 tolas of cow’s ghee In four times its quantity of water and twice its quantity of cow’s urine and with 4 tolas of the paste of white flowered leadwort. Or, the patient may drink the medicated ghee prepared in the decoction of barley, jujube and horse gram, decoction of pentaradices and Shura and Sauviraka wines.
118 118½. When as a result of these procedures, the patient attains an unctuous condition and strength, the Vata gets subdued and the morbid matter gets loosened from the seat of affection, the patient should be treated with purgative measures described in the Section on Pharmaceutics.
Pulvis
119-122. Take one tola each of the roots of snake gourd, turmeric, embelia and the shells of the three myrobalans, two tolas of kamala, three tolas of indigo and four tolas of turpeth; triturate all these into a fine powder and the patient may be given 4 tolas of it in cow’s urine. When he is well purged, the meatjuice of Jangala animals, thin gruel and milk boiled with the three spices may be given for six days. He may repeat the dose of this powder again and again.
123-123½. This powder will cure all abdominal diseases [udara] as also large accumulation of ascitic fluid, jaundice, anemia and edema. This compound snake-gourd powder is regarded highly efficacious in abdominal diseases.
124-124½. Colocynth, clenolipis, red physic nut, the barks of lodh and sweet flag should be taken with grape juice or cow’s urine, or with the juices of small jujube and wild jujube or with Sidhu wine.
Narayana powder etc.
125-128½. Take equal parts of bishop’s weed, common juniper, coriander, the three myrobalans, black cumin, celery seeds, roots of long pepper, wild carrot, long zedoary, sweet flag, dill seeds, cumin seeds, the three spices, yellow milky plant (thistle), white flowered leadwort, the two alkalis, orris root, costus, the five kinds of salts and embelia; three parts of red physic nut and two parts of turpeth and two parts of calosanthes and four parts of soap-pod; a powder prepared with all these is called ‘Narayana powder’; it is a cure for all diseases. No disease is beyond the curative power of this powder even as no Asura is beyond the conquering power of Vishnu.
129-132. Patients suffering from abdominal disease [udara] should take it with butter-milk. Patients suffering from Gulma should take it with the decoction of jujube. Patients suffering from obstruction of Vata should take it with Sura wine. Patients suffering from Vata-disorder should take it with Prasanna wine. In retention of feces, it should be taken with whey; in piles with the juice of pomegranate; in griping pain, with vanda orchid; in indigestion, with warm water; and in fistula-in-ano, anemia, dyspnea, cough, throat-spasm, disorders of the stomach, assimilation disorders, dermatosis, dullness of the gastric fire, fever, poisonous bites, poisoning by vegetable drugs and in metallic and chemical poisoning, this purgative powder should be taken as directed, after having the alimentary system oleated. Thus has been described ‘The Narayana Powder’.
133-134. Take common juniper, yellow thistle, the three myrobalans-kurroa, indigo, zalil, soap pod, turpeth, sweet flag, rock salt, bid salt and long pepper and. triturate well.
135-136½. This powder should be taken with the juice of the pomegranate, the decoction of the three myro-balans, meat-juice, cow’s urine and genially warm water in all kinds of Gulma, splenic enlargements and all kinds of abdominal disease [udara]. In leucoderma, dermatosis, irregularity of gastric fire accompanied with pain and morbid Vata, edema, piles, anemia, icterus and jaundice, the physician should quickly subdue Vata, Pitta and Kapha by means of purgation with this, powder. Thus has been described ‘The compound Common Juniper Powder.’
137-137½. The powder of indigo, hijjal, the three spices, the two alkalis, the salts and white flowered leadwort, taken with ghee, cures abdominal diseases [udara] and Gulma. Thus has. been described ‘The compound Indigo Powder’.
Other Remedies.
138-140½. Curdle 1024 tolas of cow’s milk mixed with 32 tolas of the milk of the thorny milk hedge; and when the curd is formed churn it and take out the ghee and medicate this ghee with turpeth and take a potion of it in due dose; or take the medicated ghee prepared of 64 tolas of ghee in 8 times its quantity of milk, along with the paste of 4 tolas of the thorny milk-hedge and 24 tolas of turpeth for the cure of Gulma, chronic poisoning and abdominal diseases. Thus has been described ‘The Thorny Milkhedge Milk-ghee’.
141. The medicated ghee prepared of 64 tolas of cow’s ghee in 256 tolas of whey, with the paste of 4 tolas of the [thorny?] milk hedge may be similarly taken in proper dose for the cure of abdominal disease [udara].
142-143½. These ghees should be followed by a potion of thin gruel, or delicious meat-juice When the dose of the ghee is digested and the patient well-purged, he may take lukewarm water boiled with dry ginger on the first day; on the next day he may take thin gruel and on the third day the soup of horse-gram; the person thus de-oleated may take at the next meal-time milk and solid food. He may take frequent courses of such medicated ghee followed by proper regimen in due sequence.
144-145½. The skilled physician may use these effective ghees for the alleviation of Gulma, chronic poisoning and abdominal disease [udara].
145-146½. The patient may take the ghee prepared with the paste of tooth-brush tree, for the relief of constipation or he may take Indigo-ghee which is curative of Gulma, or he may take the mixed unction described in the treatment of Gulma.
146-147½. Henceforward, I shall describe the various preparations for the complete removal of the remnants of morbidity in persons whose morbidity has been systematically removed by the above procedure and who live on a diet of the meat of Jangala animals
147-148½. The patient may drink milk with the paste of white flowered leadwort and deodar or with the paste of elephant pepper and dry ginger for a month or he may take milk with the paste of 1/2 tola each of embelia, white flowered leadwort, red physic nut, chaba pepper and the three spices and thus subdue the enlargement of the abdomen.
149-150. The patient may drink the decoction of the three myrobalans, red physic nut and white cedar mixed with the three spices and alkali; and when this dose is digested he may take his food mixed with the meat-juice of Jangala animals. He may take meat or other articles of diet mixed with the thorny milk-hedge milk ghee.
131-152½. He may follow it up with a potion of milk or take a course of chebulic myrobalans with cow’s urine; or, the patient, without taking any solid food, may drink for a week the milk and urine of the buffalo, or the milk of the camel for a mouth or goat’s milk for three months, mixed with the three spices.
152-152½. Or he may take the course of the ‘thousand chebulic myrobalans’ or a course of mineral pitch keeping himself on milk-diet; or he may take a course of gum-guggul in the manner prescribed for mineral pitch.
153-153½. The juice of green ginger with an equal quantity of milk, is beneficial; or oil prepared with ten times the quantity of the juice of green ginger may also be taken.
154-155. The oil of the seels of the red physic nut and the physic nut taken with whey, soup or meatjuice, is beneficial in abdominal disease [udara] due to tridiscordance and in colic, constipation and obstipation.
155-156½. The oils of the seeds of long leaved pine, drumstick and radish may be used for inunction and potion, in abdominal disease of the Vata type. They are curative of colic.
156-157. The best of physicians, on carefully diagnosing the predominant morbid humor, may administer medicated wines and alkalis in stasis, anorexia, nausea, dullness of the gastric fire and in alcoholism and in rigid immobile enlargement of the abdomen due to Kapha, in order to liquefy the. mucus.
158-160½. Take long pepper, lodh, asafoetida, dry ginger, elephant pepper, marking nut, fruits of drum-stick, the three myrobalans, kurroa, deodar, turmeric, Indian berberry, common sal, Indian atees, sweet flag, costus, nutgrass, and the pentad of salts; mix all these together and roast it mixed with curds, ghee, animal fat, marrow and oil; take one tola of this alkali after meals, with Madira wine, whey, warm water, medicated wine or Sura wine.
161-161½. This will cure stomach disorders, edema, Gulma, splenic disorders, piles, abdominal diseases [udara], acute intestinal irritation, misperistalsis aud Ashthila (hard tumor) due to Vata.
162-164½. The alkali prepared from the dry dung of the goat should be boiled in cow’s urine and then adding one tola each of the roots of long pepper, each of the pentad of salts, long pepper, white flowered lead-wort, dry ginger, each of the three myrobalans, turpeth, sweet flag, each of the two alkalis, soap pod, red physic nut, hiritz and stinking swallow wort, prepare pills of ½ tola weight each. The pill should be taken mixed with Sauviraka wine in edema, indigestion and advanced type of ascites.
165-166½. The patient may drink, to his heart’s content, the gruel prepared in milk of the Shadtika rice which has been impregnated in cow’s urine, and may take a post prandial potion of sugar-cane juice, for the cure: of abdominal affections. As a result, the Pitta, Kapha and the Vata return to their natural habitats.
167-167½. The physician may give the patient who passes hard scybalous stools, the leaf-sprouts of thorny milk hedge, turpeth, red physic nut, the jungle cork tree etc., made into curries before meals.
168-168½. When the morbid humor and scybalous stools have softened, the learned physician may give the patient cow’s milk combined with cow’s urine. It removes all the remaining morbidity and is beneficial.
169-169½. In cases where the Vata has produced pain in the sides, stiffness and cardiac spasm, the physician may give a potion of oil prepared with bael alkali.
170-171½. In the same manner, the physician may administer oil prepared successively with each of the alkalis obtained from wind-killer, Indian valerian, palas, til stalks, heart-leaved sida, plaintain and rough chaff, for the cure of abdominal disease [udara]. By means of this medication, the cardiac spasm due to Vata occurring in persons suffering from abdominal disease is cured.
172-172½. In conditions where the Kapha is overlaid with Vata, and Pitta or where the Vata is overlaid with the Kapha and Pitta, castor oil combined with appropriate adjuvants is beneficial if the patient is strong
173-174½. The person who even after being well purged suffers again from distension of the abdomen, should be treated with evacuative enemata prepared out of unctuous, acid and salt articles.
174-174½. Or, if the Vata causes intestinal stasis and abdominal distension, the physician should treat that patient with enema prepared with acute substances and mixed with alkali and cow’s urine.
The use of Poison
175 176. When the abdominal disease [udara] due to the gathering of fluid has gone beyond the stage of treatment or if the humoral tridiscordance has not got subdued, the physician should summon the patient’s kinsmen, well wishers, wives, brahmins, state authorities, the caste and elders, and speak to them about the precarious condition of the patient.
177-177½. ‘If not treated, the patient’s death is certain. But if treated by poison-therapy he may have a chance to survive.’ Having spoken thus and being permitted by the patient’s well-wishers to proceed, he must administer poison to the patient combined with his food and drink.
178-178½. The physician, after full consideration, should ask the patient to eat a fruit which has been bitten by an enraged cobra and in which its poison, has been deposited.
179-179½. The accumulated morbidity in the patient’s abdomen which has become firm, mixed with. the body-elements and has spread in the wrong channel, gets agitated by this poison and then getting broken up, immediately flows out.
180-180½. When his morbidity has been eliminated by the poison, he should be given an affusion-bath with cold water and made to drink milk or barley-gruel according to capacity by the physician.
181-182½. For a month afterwards, he should be given the curry prepared of turpeth, Indian pennywort, barley and white goosefoot, or of the jute plant cooked in the decoction of the jute plant without mixing either acid or salt or unctuous articles. He should not eat any food at all and when thirsty, he should drink this very decoction.
183-183½. When thus the morbidity has been eliminated by these curries for a month, the weak patient should then take the strengthen, ing milk of the camel.
184. The following is the treatment to be performed by the practical surgeon.
Operative Measure
185. The skilful surgeon should make an incision of the measure of four fingers-breadth on the left side of the abdomen below the umbilicus, with the appropriate catting instrument
186-186½. Having opened the abdomen and then carefully examining the intestines for obstruction or perforation of the intestines and anointing them with medicated ghee and clearing the hair or other substances in them, the intestines should be put back. The intestines which have been benumbed due to obstruction should be released.
The use of ants
187-188. And if there is perforation of the intestines, the part should be made to be bitten by big black ants and seeing that the perforation is well closed by the firm bites taken by the ants, their bodies must be cut off. then putting the intestines back in their place, the abdominal skin should be sutured with the needle.
189. In case of formation of fluid in all kinds of abdominal diseases [udara], the physician should tap the abdomen on the left side below the umbilicus and drain the fluid by inserting a cannla into it.
190. Having drained all the fluid by pressure on all sides, the abdomen should be tied with a tight clothbandage; and whenever the abdomen is retracted by enemata, purgation or similar measures, it should be similarly tightly bandaged,
191. When all the fluid is drained, the patient having fasted, should drink thin gruel free from unctuous article or salt. After that for six months, he should live on a milk diet alone.
Milk-diet
192-192½. For three months more he may take thin gruel with, milk and for a further period of three months he may take light diet of Sanwa and common millets, mixed with milk but without salt. The patient taking the course of milk-diet in this way for a year will subdue the condition of accumulation of fluid in the abdomen (ascites).
193-194. After taking all the medications, the course of milk-diet should be resorted to for preventing the occurrence of the sequela of the morbid humor and also for the maintenance of the patient’s strength. Milk is wholesome to the patient suffering from abdominal disease [udara] , and whose body is emaciated consequent upon the procedure of treatment, as also to persons afflicted with the loss of all body elements, and is to them what nectar is to the gods.
Here are the two recapitulatory verses—
Summary
195-196. The etiology, premonitory symptoms, signs and symptoms of the eight kinds of abdominal diseases [udara] in extenso and in brief, complications, seriousness, curability and incurability, characteristics of slight and full formation of fluid and treament in brief as well as in extenso, have all been described by the sage, in this chapter on The Therapeutics of Abdominal Disease.
13. Thus, in the Section on Therapeutics in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the thirteenth chapter entitled ‘The Therapeutics of Abdominal Disease [udara-cikitsa]’ not being available the same as restored by Dridhabala, is completed.
Two Varieties
5. O, Agnivesha! there are two kinds of piles [arshas]; some are congenital and some are acquired i.e., developed during the course of one’s life. The cause of congenital piles is the vitiation of the embryonic cell forming the anal folds. There are two factors which go to vitiate the embryonic cells. Firstly, there are the indiscretions in diet and action of the mother and father; and secondly, the evil action done by oneself in the past births. This rule holds good in all other congenital diseases. ‘Congenital’ means those disorders that come with birth. ‘Piles’ means disorder characterized by growth of flesh.
Sites and Susceptible elements
6. The site of all varieties of piles [arshas] is the area of five fingers and a half in breadth consisting of the three folds or valves dividing the ano-rectal region into three parts. This is its site or habitat. Some physicians opine that the piles or fleshy growths appear on many regions of the body, as for example, on the phallus, vagina, throat, palate, mouth, nose, ear, eye-lids and the skin. In this treatise, these fleshy growths are grouped under as hypertrophy or excrescent growths of flesh; while these occurring in the rectum alone are referred to as piles. The seat of all varieties of piles is fat, flesh and skin.
Congenital Piles [arshas]
7.Of the piles which are congenital, some are small and some are large. Some are long and some are short; some are protuberant and some are irregularly spread; some are internally curved, some externally curved and some are [matted?] together and some turned inwards. Their characteristic colors are in accordance with the particular causative morbid humors.
8-(1). The man affected with congenital piles [arshas] is, from his very birth, exceedingly lean, discolored emaciated, low-spirited and suffers from excessive formation and stasis of flatus, urine and feces. He suffers from gravel and calculus and from constipation and diarrhea irregularly. He passes digested and undigested matter in his stools; he passes dry or loose stools and now and then he passes stools which are colored, white, yellowish-white, green, yellow, red, dusky red, thin, thick, slimy and smelling like a corpse and consisting of undigested fecal matter. He suffers from severe griping pain in umbilical, hypo-gastric and inguinal regions. He suffers from pain in the rectum, dysentery, horripilation, urinary disorders, continued intestinal stasis, borborygmus, misperistalsis, excessive secretion in the stomach and sense-organs; he suffers from severe incessant, bitter and acid eructations. He is very weak, his digestive fire is also weak; he has scanty semen, is irritable, difficult of treatment, overcome by cough, dyspnea, asthma, thirst, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, indigestion, coryza an 1 sternutation. He gets fainting fits, suffers from headaches, his voice is weak, broken, low impeded and hollow. He suffers from ear-disease, puffiness of hands, feet, face and the region round the eyes, from fever, body-ache and pain in all the bones and joints. He is affected now and then with rigidity in the side of the body, lumbar, hypogastric and epigastric regions, back and waist. He is moody and exceedingly indolent.
8. On account of the obstruction, in the passage covered with the congenital piles, the Apana Vata being forced to go upwards, provokes all the other four varieties of Vata [vāta] viz., Samana [samāna], Vyana [vyāna], Prana [prāṇa] and Udana [udāna] as also Pitta and Kapha. These five kinds of Vata combined with Pitta and Kapha overpower the person affected with piles and produce the aforesaid disorders. Thus ends the description of the congenital variety of piles.
General Etiology
9-(1). From now onwards we shall describe the acquired variety of piles [arshas].
9-(2). By taking heavy, sweet, cold, softened, irritant, and antagonistic articles of diet, or predigestion meals or limited diet or food that is not homologous; by eating beef, fish, flesh of pig, buffalo, goat and sheep; by constant use of lean, dry, and putrid meats, pastries, puddings and the products of milk, whey, til and gur; by the use of the gruels of black gram, juice of the sugarcane, til, paste, common yam, dry vegetables, vinegar, garlic, cream of milk and cream of curds, lotus stalks and bulbs, Indian water-chestnut, milk, bulbs, sprouted and fresh cereals and pulses and green radish; by eating heavy fruits, vegetables, pickles and greens, Mardaka, animal fats, head, feet, and stale, putrid, cold or promiscuous diet; by drinking immature curds and over-fermented wines; by drinking contaminated and heavy water; by taking oleation in excess; by neglecting purificatory procedures; by the wrong application of enemata; by lack of exercise and sex act, and by day-sleeping; by habitual, resort to excessive reclining, lounging and sitting—by such practises as these, there occurs excessive formation of excretory matter in one whose gastric fire is impaired.
9. Similarly, by the use of high uneven and hard seats, by riding on uncontrolled conveyances or on camels; by excessive indulgence in sex; by improper insertion of the enema nozzles; by injuries to the anal region, by frequent application of cold water, by constant ribbing with rags, clods, grass etc., by continued straining; by th forcible attempts to pass flatus, urine, and feces; by suppression of the natural urges when they have naturally arisen; in women by miscarriage or by pressure 011 the pregnant uterus or by abnormal delivery—by all the above mentioned causes the Apana Vata becomes provoked and laying hold of the downward going accumulated fecal matter deposits it in the region of the rectal valves. In this manner piles originate in the anorectal region.
Shapes of the Piles [arshas]
10. The different shapes of the piles are—that of rape-seed, lentil-seed, black gram or green gram, or of barley or of garden pea, emetic nut, caper berry, cabbage, false mangosteen, wild jujube, jequirity seed, scarlet-fruited gourd, Indian jujube, caper, gular fig, date, jambul, cow’s teat, thumb, rush nut, water chest nut, galls or of the shape of the beak or the tongue of the cock, peacock and parrot or the closed pericarp of the lotus. This is the general description of piles [arshas] characterised by the aggravation of the one or the other of the three humors—Vata, Pitta and Kapha.
Vata type
11. These are their special characteristics—The piles [arshas] that do not discharge, that are wrinkled, hard, rough, dry, and of dusky red color, sharp-pointed, tortuous, fissured or ulcerated, irregularly spread and associated with various kinds of pain such as colicky, convulsive, pricking, twitching, tingling and hyper-asthetic, that disclose homologation to unctuous and hot things; that are associated with loose stools, distension, severe spasmodic condition of the phallus, scrotum, bladder, groin and stomach; with body-aches and tachy-cardia; continued retention of flatus, urine and feces; with aching pain in the thigh, loins, back, waist, side of the chest, lumbar and hypogastric ragions; with headache, sternutations, eructations, coryza, cough, misperistalsis, tonic contraction, consumption, edema, fainting, anorexia, disgeusia [dysgeusia?], faintness, pruritus, pain in the nose, ears and temples, impairment of the voice, and hardness and dusky red coloration of nails, eyes, face, skin, urine and feces. The above signs and symptoms are Characteristic of the piles of the Vata type.
Here are two verses again—
12-13. Astringent, pungent, bitter, dry, cold and light articles of diet, measured and scanty eating, indulgence starvation, cold climate and season, excessive physical activity, grief, undue exposure to wind and sun; these are the causes of the piles [arshas] of the Vata type.
Pitta type
14. Being soft, flabby, delicate, tender to touch, of red, yellow, blue or black color, excessive sweat and discharge, smelling like raw meat, discharging thin, yellow or reddish fluid, bleeding, burning, itching, aching or pricking pains, and tendency to suppuration, homologation to cold things; loose stools of yellow or greenish tinge, excessive formation of fecal matter and urine that are yellow and of the smell of raw meat; thirst, fever, asthma, fainting, repugnance for food, and yellow coloration of nails, eyes, skin, urine and feces; the above mentioned are the signs and symptoms characteristic of the piles of the Pitta type.
Here are two verses again—
15-16. Pungent, acid, salt and alkaline articles of diet, excessive physical excercise, exposure to the heat of fire or the sun, hot climate or season, anger, wine, envy, and whatever eats, drinks and drugs are irritant, acute and hot—all these are to be known as causative factors of the piles [arshas] of the Pitta type.
Kapha type
17. Being considerable in size, protuberant, smooth, painless to touch, moist, white, yellowish white, sticky, indurated, heavy, rigid, benumbed, with rigid swelling all round, excessively itching, with continuous and profuse discharge of tawny, whitish or reddish and slimy fluid; associated with urine and feces which are heavy, slimy and whitish, having homologation to dry and hot things; attended with constant desire to pass stools that are painful (Tenesmus), and distension of ilio-inguinal region; with griping pain, nausea, ptyalism, cough, anorexia, coryza, heaviness, vomiting, dysuria, consumption, edema, anemia, algid fever, lithiasis, gravel, increased secretions in the stomach and sense organs, and sweet taste in the mouth and are causative of urinary disorder, those persisting for a long time and excessively weakening the gastric fire, causing impotence, giving rise to strong chymedisorders accompanied with sallowness of nails, eyes, face, skin, urine and feces—these are the signs and symptoms and characteristics of the piles [arshas] of the Kapha type.
Here are two verses again—
Sweet, unctuous, cold, salt, acid and heavy articles of diet, lack of exercise, day-sleep, excessive addiction to sitting and lying down, exposure to easterly winds, cold climate or season, mental inactivity—these are considered the causative factors of piles [arshas] of the Kapha type.
20. When there is a combination of the two types of causative factors aud symptoms, know it to be piles of the bidiscordance-type. And all the etiological factors combined cause piles of the tridiscordance-type. The signs and symptoms of the tridiscordance-type are just like those of congenital piles.
Premonitory Symptoms
21-22. Intestinal stasis, weakness, distension of abdomen, emaciation, excessive eructation, flabbiness of the thighs, acoprosis, and the condition having great resemblance to that of assimilation-disorders, anemia and abdominal disease—these are described to be the premonitory symptoms in the development of piles [arshas].
23. Piles never appear without the discordance of all the three humors. Each variety of piles receives its appellation according to the particular humor which is in excess in such tridiscordance.
24. The five kinds of Vata aud Pitta and Kapha and the region of the rectum between the three valves are all irritated in the formation of piles.
25. Hence piles [arshas] are painful, productive of many complications, afflictive of the whole body and most difficult of cure.
Signs of incurability
26. That patient with piles [arshas] is incurable, who develops edema of hands, feet, face, navel and anorectal region, scrotum and also who has pain in the cardiac region and side of the chest.
27.Pain in the cardiac region and the sides of the chest, faintness, vomiting, body-ache, fever, thirst and pyogenic inflammation of the anorectal region cause death of the patient suffering from piles [arshas].
28. Congenital piles, piles due to tridiscordance, and internal piles which are situated higher up in the rectal folds, are to be considered incurable-
29. The above condition may be palliable if the patient has vitality enough to survive and the four basic factors of treatment are favourable and the vital fire is active; otherwise, the condition is irremediable.
30. The piles due to bidiscordance and those which are situated in the second valve of the rectum and those which have existed for more than a year are said to be formidable.
31. Piles [arshas]which are formed in the external fold, or which are due to the discordance of one humor, or which are of recent duration are easily curable.
32. The wise physician should be prompt in the treatment of these conditions because by obstructing the rectum, they may lead to anorectal type of intestinal obstruction,
33. On this subject, some physicians say that the excision of piles [arshas] by instrument is advisable; while some recommend cauterization by caustics; while some recommend thermal cauterization.
34. We may take it that all these three measures may be carried out by the skilled and experienced operator; yet a mistake in the operative process is fraught with grave consequence.
Risks in Operation
35-36. As for instance, loss of manhood, edema in the anorectal region, loss of splinter control, distension of abdomen, acute pain and affliction, profuse bleeding, recurrence of piles, softening of scars, prolapse of rectum and even sudden death; all these, may occur as the untoward effects of the operative or caustic and thermal cauterisation procedures.
Safe line of Treatment
37. Now I shall describe for the radical cure of piles, the line of treatment which is easeful, less likely to go wrong and not drastic.
38. The specialists consider the dry type of piles to he due to excess of Vata and Kapha and the discharging or moist type of piles to be due to vitiation of the blood and Pitta.
39-(1). Here I shall first describe the treatment of dry piles.
39-42½. The physician should first give sudation-procedure to the piles which are indurated and also to those that are edematous and accompanied with pain. After smearing the piles with the oil prepared with white-flowered leadwort, barley-alkali and bael, the physician should foment the part, at a genial degree of warmth, with lump-sudation prepared of barley, black gram, horse-gram and Pulaka grain, or the lumps of the dung of cow, ass or horse, or of til-paste or of chaff, or of the lump of sweet flag and dill-seeds, mixed with unctuous substance. Or they should be fomented with the lump prepared of roasted paddy-flour made unctuous with oil-cum ghee or of drumstick, or Indian groundsel, or of common juniper mixed with unctuous articles.
43-44. Or the part, being smeared with the oil of costus, should be fomented with lumps prepared of powdered brick, celery-seeds or vegetable carrot. The part should be douched with the decoction of the leaves of vasaka, mudar, castor plant and bael,
45-45½. The person afflicted with painful piles [arshas] should, after well anointing the part, take a sitz-bath in water in which have been decocted the leaves of radish, the three myrobalans, mudar, bamboo, three-leaved caper, wind killer, drum-stick, and common mountain ebony.
46-47. The patient who is well anointed in the affected part should take a tepid sitz-bath in the decocted water of jujube, or in water medicated with Sauviraka and Tushodaka wines. Or, he may, being well anointed, take a genially warm sitz-bath prepared of the decoction of bael or butter-milk or whey or sour conjee or cow’s urine.
48. Applications prepared of the fat of the black cobra, hog, camel, bat or cat may be made on the piles and likewise, fumigation with these articles is beneficial in piles.
49. The fumigation done with human hair, the serpent’s slough, cat’s hide, the root of mudar, or the leaves of Shami tree is beneficial in Piles.
50-51. Coriander, embelia, deodar, and whole-barley, mixed with ghee, or yellow-berried nightshade, wintercherry, long pepper and holy basil, mixed with ghee, or the dung of hog or bull, and roasted-paddy flour, mixed with ghee; or dung of elephant or resin mixed with ghee, all these four recipes, may be used for fumigation.
52. The application may be made on the piles [arshas], of the milk of thorny milk-hedge plant mixed with turmeric powder, or the powder of long pepper and turmeric, prepared as paste in ox-bile.
53. Seeds of Shirisha, costus, long pepper, rock salt, gur, milk of mudar and milk of thorny milk-hedge plant and the three myrobalans make a good application for Piles.
54. An ointment of long pepper, white-flowered leadwort, black turpeth, yeast, and pulp of emetic nut, mixed with droppings of cock, turmeric aud gur is good in Piles.
55. Red physic nut, black turpeth, blue vitriol, droppings of pigeon and gur make a good ointment. Also the ointment prepared of bones of the elephant, neem and marking nut is good.
56. The ointment prepared of yellow orpiment with the fat of camel or with the fat of susu, applied slightly warm is curative of local pain and edema.
57. The ointment of the milk of mudar, the stalks of thorny milk-hedge and the sprouts of bottle gourd, and Indian beech, prepared in goat’s urine, is an excellent application for Piles.
58. All the recipes enumerated above, beginning with ointments and ending with applications, are considered curative of induration, edema, itching and pain in the Piles.
59. The aforesaid remedies cause the piles [arshas] to empty out the accumulated vitiated blood; and then the patient is restored to ease.
Blood-letting
60-61. If the disease is not relieved either by cold or hot or the unctuous or dry therapy, the disease must be due to vitiated blood. Therefore, the physician should let out the blood. The physician should let out the blood which has not flowed out by the above methods from the blood-gorged piles by the repeated application of leeches, or of cutting instruments or needles. Powders
62-64. The physician should give the following powder if the patient is afflicted with edema and pain in the anorectal region and with weakness of the gastric fire. The three spices, roots of long pepper, Patha, asafoetida, white flowered lead-wort, sanchal salt, orris root, cumin seeds, pulp of bael, vid salt, bishop’s weed, common juniper, embelia, rock salt, sweet flag arid tamarind. The patient, taking this powder with whey, - wine or warmwater, is relieved of piles [arshas], assimilation disorders, colic and constipation.
65-66. Or, the patient may be given all the digestive medicines which are described in the treatment of diarrhea, or he may eat chebulic myrobalan with gur before meals. Or he may be given the turpeth-powder with the decoction of the three myrobalans. When the morbidity in the rectum has been removed, the Piles naturally get diminished.
67. Or, he may be given chebulic myrobalans kept over-night in cow’s urine, mixed with gur; or he may be given the powder of chebulic myrobalans or of the three myrobalans mixed with butter-milk.
68. Or, he may be given white-flowered leadwort and ginger mixed with Sidhu wine or he may be given cumin seeds, white flowered leadwort and Sidhu wine mixed with chaba pepper.
68½. Or, he may be given Sura wine to drink mixed with common juniper and sanchal salt.
69-70. Or, he may be given demulcent drink of butter-milk prepared with wood-apple and bael or with chaba pepper and white flowered leadwort or with- marking nut or with bael and dry ginger or with celery seeds and white-flowered leadwort.
71. Or, he may be given the powder of leadwort, common juniper and asafoetida along with buttermilk; or he may be given butter-milk mixed with the five spices.
72-75. Take common juniper, black cumin, coriander, cumin seeds, celery, zedoary, long pepper, roots of long pepper, white flowered leadwort, elephant pepper, bishop’s weed and celery; triturate them and mix with whey; when it is slightly sour and pungent, the skilled pharmacist should place the whole in a vessel smeared with ghee. And when this medicated butter-milk wine is well fermented and becomes markedly sour and pungent and palatable, it should be taken in proper dosage thrice during meals when the patient feels thirsty. It is digestive-stimulant, appetizing, promotive of complexion, regulative of Kapha and Vata, curative of edema, itching and pain in the anorectal region and also promotive of vitality. Thus has been described ‘The medicated Buttermilk Wine’.
Course of butter-milk
76. An earthen pot should be smeared with the paste of the bark of the roots of white-flowered leadwort.
The curd or butter-milk formed in this pot may be taken for the cure of Piles.
77. There is no better remedy in this world than butter-milk for the piles [arshas] of Vata-cum-Kapha type. It should be used with or without unctuous substance according to the nature of the morbid humor.
78, The physician, skilled in constitutional pathology and climatology should give a course of butter-milk for seven days, or ten days, or a fortnight or even a month.
79. If the vital fire of the patient is exceedingly low, he should be kept only on butter-milk. He should be given in the evening the porridge prepared of roasted-paddy flour in butter-milk,

82 The physician, skilled in the dietetic therapy, should not abruptly stop the butter-milk diet A gradual withdrawal of the course of buttermilk which has lasted for a month is beneficial.
83-83½. The decrease should be as gradual as the increase in the buttermilk course; no reduction should, however, be made in the solid food. This course has been prescribed for the restoration and maintenance of strength and for strengthening the gastric fire and for the promotion of vitality, plumpness and complexion.
84-84½. The physician skilled in humoral, gastric and constitutional pathology should prescribe buttermilk of the following three kinds: one with all the butter removed, the second with half the butter removed and the third with none of the butter removed.
85-86. The piles destroyed by butter-milk will never recur; when butter-milk sprinkled on the ground burns up even tenacious grass, what need be said of mere dry piles in the body of a person whose vital fire is active.
87. The body-channels being purified, the nutrient fluid circulates well to all the parts of the body, and hence the patient acquires plumpness, vitality, healthy complexion and cheerfulness.

Treatment in Bleeding Piles [arshas]
169½. Hereafter listen to an exposition of the successful line of treatment in bleeding or discharging piles.
170-172. In this type of piles, there occur two kinds of sequela. They are, one due to Kapha and the other due to Vata. If the stools are dark, hard and dry, if the patient does not pass flatus, if the blood oozing from the piles is thin, of dusky red color and frothy, if there is pain in the waist, thigh and rectum, if there is excessive weakness, and if the etiological factors are of the dehydrating type, then the complication is of Vata.
173-174. If the stools are soft, whitish or yellowish, unctuous, heavy and cold and if the blood issuing from the piles is thick, accompanied with shreds or fibres, yellowish white or slimy; if the rectum is slimy and rigid -and if the etiological factors are of the heavy and unctuous nature, then the condition should be diagnosed by the wise physicians as the complication of Kapha, in bleeding piles.
175. The treatment with unctuous and cold measures is beneficial in Vata and with dry and cold measures in complications due to Kapha. So, after careful consideration, the appropriate line of treatment should be prescribed.
176. On knowing the condition to be due to the excess of Pitta and Kapha, the patient should be subjected to the purificatory procedure. The bleeding, in such case, may either be ignored or treated with the lightening therapy.
177-179½. If an unskilled physician stops the initial bleeding from the piles [arshas], then this retention of vitiated blood gives rise to many disorders, namely—hemothermia, fever, thirst, weakness of gastric fire, anorexia, jaundice, edema, colic in the ano-rectal and inguinal regions, pruritus, ulcers, wheals, pimples, dermatosis, anemia, retention of flatus, urine and feces, headache, stiffness, heaviness of limbs and other diseases due to vitiated blood.
180. Therefore, it is only when all vitiated blood has flowed out that the hemostatic line of treatment is indicated.
181-182. So the physician who i skilled in etiology, symptomatology hematology and the knowledge o time and constitution should ignore the bleeding so long as it is not cans ing an emergency. Later, he should treat the patient with bitter drug for the stimulation of the gastric fire, for hemostasis and digestion of morbid matter.
183. The bleeding which occurs in a patient in whom the morbidity has diminished but in whom Vata is still in excess, is remediable by the oleation therapy given in the form of potion, inunction or unctuous enemata.
184. The bleeding due to excess of Pitta and which occurs during the hot weather must be invariably stopped if there is no complication of Vata or Kapha.
185. The decoction of kurchi bark mixed with a small quantity of dry ginger is a coagulant and hemostatic; so are the bark of pomegranate and the decoction of sandal-wood with a little of dry ginger.
186. The decoction of sandal-wood, chiretta, Cretan prickly clover and a little of dry ginger is sedative of bleeding piles So is the decoction of the bark of Indian berberry, cuscus and neem.
187. Indian atees, kurchi bark and kurchi seeds and extract of Indian berberry, mixed with honey are hemostatics and they may be given with rice-water whenever the patient is thirsty, in the treatment of bleeding piles.
188-190½. Decoct 400 tolas of fresh kurchi bark in pure rain water till all the juice from the bark has mixed with the water; then filter it and take the solution and add to it equal quantities of the powders of the gum of silk cotton, sensitive plant, perfumed cherry and thrice the quantity of kurchi seeds. This should be filtered, boiled and thickened till its sticks to the ladle and then used. This prepared extract of kurchi-bark, taken at the regular time and in proper dose, according to one’s strength of gastric fire, along with goat’s milk or thin gruel, controls the hemorrhage of bleeding piles.
191. When the dose of this mixture is digested, the patient should take boiled Shali rice with goat’s milk.
Soft extract etc.
192. This prepared soft extract cures bleeding piles [arshas], diarrhea with blood in stools, and diseases born of vitiated blood; it also controls the severe type of hemothermia affecting either the upper or the lower channel. Thus has been described ‘The compound prepared Soft Extract of Kurchi’.
193. The patient may take blue water-lily sensitive plant, gum of silk cotton, sandal wood, til and lodh with goat’s milk and thereafter take a meal of Shali rice with goat’s milk.
194. The goat’s milk given with the juice of white goose foot controls bleeding. The meat-juice of the birds and beasts of Jangala group, either slightly mixed with acid or not at all, has similar effect.
195. The powder of Patha, kurchi seeds, extract of Indian berberry, dry ginger, and celery seeds should be given to the patient suffering from painful piles.
195½. Indian berberry, chiretta, nutgrass and Cretan prickly clover are hemostatics.
196. If there is excessive bleeding and pain, ghee prepared with the above drugs should be used.
197. The ghee prepared with the paste of the seeds and bark of kurchi, fragrant poon, blue water lily, lodh and fulsee flowers should be given by the physician, in the condition of colic and bleeding piles [arshas].
198. The ghee prepared with the juice of pomegranate and barley-alkali quickly subdues the pain and hemorrhage of piles; similar is the action of the ghee prepared with the paste of Indian night-shade and asthma-weed.
199. The gruel of roasted paddy prepared with country sorrel, fragrant poon and blue water lily, quickly controls hemorrhage; so does the gruel prepared with heart leaved sida and painted leaved uraria.
200-201. The patient may take gruel prepared with the decoction of fragrant sticky mallow and dry ginger, mixed with butter and acidified with kokam butter or sour pomegranate or tamarind or sour jujube; or the patient may be given thin gruel prepared with turnip and Sura wine and seasoned with oil-cum-ghee. This gruel is curative of diarrhea with blood in stools, colic, dysentery and edema.
202-203. Choppings of white teak, emblic myrobalan, white mountain ebony, turnip, silk cotton, asthma-weed and country sorrel, or of the buds of banyan tree or flowers of variegated mountain ebony, prepared with the creamy top of curds and acidified with sour-fruits, may be given in severe hemorrhage.
Onion Dish etc
204. A vegetable dish of onion prepared with butter-milk or of Indian spinach mixed with the juice of sour jujube or the soup of lentils, acidified with butter-milk, may be given in hemorrhage.
205. The patient may take the meal of Shali, Shyamaka or Kodrava rice with boiled milk, or with the acidified soup of lentils, green gram, pigeon pea and math-gram.
206. Or, the patient may take his meal with the flesh of rabbit, deer, quail, grey partridge and black buck, well prepared with sweet and acid articles and mixed with a small quantity of black pepper.
207. If on account of the excessive loss of blood from the piles, Vata is provoked in the body, the patient should take meat-juice of cock, peacock, partridge or of the two humped camel or of fox, mixed with sweet and acid thing.
208. The onion taken by itself or with sauce, vegetable-soup or gruel, subdues excessive hemorrhage and Vata.
209. In condition of scanty formation of feces and loss of blood, flesh of the middle part of the young goat along with its blood, prepared with a large quantity of onion and made sweet and sour alternately, should be given.
210. The bleeding type of piles [arshas] disappear by the habitual use of butter and til or fragrant poon, butter and sugar, or emulsified curdcream-
211. The fresh butter, ghee and flesh of goat, Shashtika rice and Shali rice, the top part of fresh Sura wine or fresh Sura wine itself will check the hemorrhage.
212.In conditions of excessive bleeding piles, though the Kapha and Pitta are also morbid, the Vata gets excessively morbid. Therefore, in such conditions, the Vata needs to be paid more attention to.
213. On finding the hemorrhagic tendency great, and symptoms of Kapha and Vata very little, a refrigerent line of treatment as described previously as well as hereafter should be carried out.
Affusions
214. The decoction of liquorice, the five barks, the bark of the jujube, gular fig and crane tree and leaves of snake-gourd, or the decoction of vasaka, Arjun, Hebrew manna plant and neem may be used as affusion.
215.If there has occured excessive loss of blood and if there is burning pain and softening of the piles [arshas], the patient may be given a bath prepared with the decoction of liquorice, lotus stalks, Himalayan cherry, sandal wood, sacrificial grass aud thatch grass.
216.Or, having previously anointed the part with the oil prepared with drugs of cooling potency, he should be given a sitz-bath prepared with the decoction of liquorice and country-willow and mixed with sugar-cane juice or a bath of cold milk.
217. Having applied ghee mixed with sugar over the genitals, anus and the perineum, a douche prepared of agreeably cold water and medicated with astringent drugs should be given to these parts
218. Frequent applications with fresh leaves of the plantain or of the water lily, or of the petals of the lotus and blue lily wet with cold water is beneficial.
219. Application of ghee prepared with scutch grass, the washed ghee hundred or thousand times and the cold air directed from hand-fans, quickly control bleeding.
220-221. ‘Piles’ should be dressed with the ointment prepared of Indian madder and liquorice, or til and
liquorice, or extract of Indian berberry and ghee, or resin and ghee, or neem and ghee, or honey and ghee, or bark of Indian berberry and ghee, or lily, sandal wood and ghee, in conditions of burning, softening and prolapse of rectum.
222. If the bleeding does not stop with these remedies or with other cooling-remedies, the wise physician should implete the patient by timely use of nourishing diet of meat juice, having unctuous and hot qualities.
223. The physician should promptly treat him by giving post-prandial potions of ghee and with inunction of lukewarm medicated ghee of oily or lukewarm affusions of milk, ghee or oil.
Mucilaginous Enema
224. If the Vata is predominant, he should be immediately given the lukewarm unctuous enema of the supernatent part of ghee, or he may be? given the very effective mucilaginous enema at the proper time.
225-228. Take 8 tolas of each of the root of cretan prickly clover, small sacrificial grass and thatch grass, flowers of silk cotton, buds of the banyan, gular fig and holy fig trees and decoct them in 192 tolas of water with 64 tolas of milk.

General Treatment
Here are some verses again—
243. The physician should use alternate remedies, as for instance, sweet articles followed by acid articles and cold treatment immediately followed by hot treatment. Such treatment carried out with due consideration of the strength of the patient’s gastric fire, subdues diseases produced by piles [arshas].
244-245. The three diseases, namely, piles, diarrhea, and assimilationdisorders are generally causative factors of one another. In all these, if the intensity of the gastric fire is diminished, the intensity of the disease is increased, and if the intensity of gastric fire is increased, the force of the disease is lessened. Therefore, the gastric fire ought to be well protected particularly in these three diseases.
246. Piles should be subdued by the use of a course of fried vegetables, gruels, soups, meat-juices, currysoups and of milk and butter-milk in various forms.
247 Whatever eats, drinks and drugs are regulators of Vata and promoters of the gastric fire should be daily made use of, by patients suffering from piles [arshas].
248. Whatever is antagonistic to the above and whatever is described as causative factor, should never be made use of by the patient afflicted with piles.

14. Thus in the Section on Therapeutics in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the fourteenth Chapter entitled ‘The Therapeutics of Piles [arsha/arshas-cikitsa]’ is completed.
The Function of Body-Fire
3. The life-span, complexion, vitality. good health, enthusiasm, plump ness, glow, vital essence, lustre heat and the life-breaths are derived from the thermogenetic process (fire in the body).
4. When this fire is extinguished man dies; when a man is endued with it adequately, he lives long in good health. When it is deranged, he begins to ail. Therefore, the thermal function is said to be the main-stay of life.
5. The food which is considered the nourishing factor of the body-element, vital essence, vitality, complexion and other things, that very food too, is dependent for its nutrient action on the gastric fire, as from the undigested food the body-elements cannot be formed.
The Digestive process
6-7. The Prana Vata, whose function is to ingest food, draws it into the stomach. There the food, getting mixed with the digestive fluid is broked up and on being mixed with unctuous substance, becomes softened. Then the gastric fire, being agitated and carried by the Samana Vata, digests the food eaten in proper dose and at the proper time, and leads to the increase of life.
8. Just as the fire cooks rice and water in a pot and converts it into boiled rice, so the gastric fire which is situated below the stomach cooks the ingested food to convert it into the nutrient fluid and excretory matter.
9. Just after ingestion, the food prepared from the six categories of taste acquires first the sweet taste on being digested, and leads to the formation of Kapha or of mucus-like fluid which is of frothy appearance.
10. Further, digestion being continued, the food becomes acid in the next stage of digestion and while it is coming out of the stomach it excites the secretion of limpid bile.
11. Then, the food, having reached the large intestines and being dehydrated by the body-heat, is converted into fecal lumps- These being of pungent taste, there occurs increase of Vata.
12. Pleasant food, combined with articles possessing fragrance and other qualities, nourishes individually the senses and the sense-organs of smell etc.
13. Then the five kinds of latent heat innate in each of the protoelements of the body—earth, water, fire, wind and ether, digest each its own corresponding component proto-element in the ingested food which is a compound of the proto-elements.
14. Just as a quality in the substances nourishes individually its corresponding quality in the body, as for example, the proto-element of earth in the body is nourished by the proto-element of earth in the article ingested, similarly the other proto-elements nourish their corresponding qualities, thus making for complete nourishment.
15. The body-sustaining elements, which are seven, undergo combustion by their innate heat and each of them gets transformed into two products namely, excretory and vital substances.
The formation of Body-elements
16. From the nutrient fluid is formed the blood, thence the flesh, from flesh fat and thence bone, from it marrow and thence semen and from it, which is the essence of all the others, conception takes place.
17. From the nutrient-fluid are formed the breast-milk and the menstrual blood; from blood are formed tendons and vessels; from the flesh is formed muscular fat and six layers of the skin; and from the adipose tissue are formed sinews.
The Respective Excretory matter
18-18½. The excretory matter formed out of food are feces and urine. The excretory matter from the nutrient fluid is mucus; the one from the blood is bile; the one from the flesh is the excretion of the body-orifices; the one from the fat is sweat; the excretory substance from connective tissue is the hair on the head and the body; the excretion from the marrow is sebum-cutaneum and sebum palpebrale.
19-19½. In this way proceeds the formation of the excretory and vital substances from the combustion of body-elements. They support one another and maintain the continuance of the mutual association and nourishment of the body-elements.
20-21. The effect of virilific and the like substances is promoting the strength quickly. Some are of opinion that it takes for their full assimilation a period of six days and nights; but the truth is, (here is continual circulation of the food-essence like a wheel”.
22. When the teacher had spoken thus, the disciple asked, ‘How is blood produced in the body from the nutrient fluid which has no resemblance to the blood?
23 The nutrient fluid has no redness. How then does it obtain the redness of the blood? How again is the solid flesh in men produced from the fluid blood?
24. How is the fluctuating element fat produced from the firm element of flesh? Again, how is the roughness of bones produced from the smooth flesh and fat?
24½. How is the soft and unctuous marrow produced inside the bones which are hard?
25-26½. If the semen is born put of the change in the marrow, and if as the wise say, semen is in the entire body and the marrow which is inside the bones becomes the semen, how does it flow out, as there are no holes or leaks in the bone?’
27. Being thus questioned by the disciple the master replied.
Blood Pigmentation
28. That which is called the ‘bright constituent’ of body fluids of all men acquires the redness from the coloring quality of the fiery element of Pitta.
Formation of Body-elements
29-29½. That blood combined with the air, water, light and the thermal element obtains solidity and gets converted into flesh. That, again, being ripened by its own heat and stirred up by that heat and getting combined with the quality of water and unctuous substances, becomes the fat.
30-30½. When the heat in the fat is combined with the proto-elements of earth, fire, air etc., it produces roughness and out of it is born the osseous element in men.
31-32. The air-element makes pores inside the bones and fills them with fat. Hence it is that the marrow is called unctuous substance and from that unctuous substance in the marrow is produced the semen.
33. By the influence of air, ether, and other proto-elements, the bones become porous and from the pores the semen oozes out like water filled in a new-pot.
34. Through the secretory channels it spreads into the entire body and it gets released from its places in the body by the exhilaration of sexual desire born of love.
35. It melts like ghee owing to the heat of the sexual-exertion and being released from its natural habitat, gets collected in the seminal vesicles and then flows out like water from a higher to a lower region.
36. The nutrient fluid is circulated continually in the entire body at the same time, by the Vyāna Vata by virtue of its physiological function of spreading.
37-37½. While being circulated, if this nutrient fluid accumulates at any one place in the body, owing to the mordidity [morbidity?] of the circulatory passage, it causes pathological changes there, just as the cloud causes rain in the sky. The same is the case with the humors which become the cause of local morbid conditions
38. Thus has been described the metabolic function of the thermic element in the five proto-elements.
The Prime importance of the gastric fire
39. The gastric fire is considered the supreme king of all the metabolic agents in the body. They are all originated from it. Their waxing and waning are dependent upon the increase and decrease of the gastric fire.
40. Therefore, one should strive to preserve the gastric fire with the fuel of wholesome food and drink taken in the right manner For in the proper maintenance of the gastric fire are based long life and vitality.
41. If a man takes his food indiscriminately yielding to the desires of the palate, he soon is afflicted with the disorders of the assimilatory system as a result thereof. These disorders will hereafter be described.
Factors impairing the gastric fire
42-44. By abstinence from food, indigestion, over-eating, irregular eating, taking unwholesome, heavy, cold, excessively dry and putrid articles of diet, by wrongful effects of purgation, emesis and oleation, by emaciation consequent upon disease or the incompatibility of country, clime or season or by the suppression of the natural urges, the gastric fire gets vitiated. Thus being vitiated, it does not digest even the lightest of foods and the food, being undigested, turns sour and acts like a poison.
45-45½. The symptoms of this type of indigestion are intestinal stasis, asthenia, headache, fainting, giddiness, stiffness of the back and waist, pendiculation, body-ache, thirst, fever, vomiting, dysentery, anorexia and mis-digestion.
Food poisoning
46-47. That is a severe type of food-poisoning, which when combined with the Pitta, produces burning, thirst, diseases of the mouth, acid dyspepsia and other disorders of Pitta.
48. When combined with the Kapha, it produces consumption, coryza, urinary and other disorders of Kapha and if combined with morbid -Vata, it causes multifarious disorders of Vata.
49. If the toxic matter becomes localised in the urinary passage it causes urinary disorders; if localised in the feces, it causes affections of the colonic region; if localised in the nutrient fluid, it causes diseases born of the morbidity of the nutrient fluid.
50. The irregular condition of the gastric fire, digesting the food irregularly, leads to the discordance of bodyelements; and the acute condition of the gastric fire, if supplied with meagre fuel, consumes the body-elements themselves.
50½. and the normal condition of the gastric fire if fed with the proper kind of food, digests it properly and maintains the concordance of body-elements.
51. The weak gastric fire misdigests the food that either goes up or down the alimentary tract,
Signs of assimilation disorders [grahani-dosha]
52. The condition, in which the mixture of digested and undigested food flows downwards, is called the assimilation-disorder [grahani-dosha] though all the food is misdigested generally in assimilation disorders.
53. The patient passes stools which are large and hard or liquid. He is afflicted with thirst, anorexia, dysgeusia, ptyalism and asthma;
54. also edema of the hands and feet, pains in the bones and the joints, vomiting and fever; he suffers from bitter and acid eructations exuding the smell of metal and raw meat
55. The premonitory symptoms of this condition are—thirst, torpor, loss of Strength, misdigestion or delayed digestion of food and heaviness of body.
56-57. The seat of the digestive fire, owing to its action of absorption of the food, is called the organ of assimilation. It is situated above the umbilical region and is supported and strengthened by the gastric fire. It retains the food till it is fully digested and discharges it on completion of digestion into the large intestines situated on either side of the abdomen. But if it is vitiated by the weakness of gastric fire, it lets go even undigested food.
58. Assimilation disorders [grahani] result from morbid Vata or Pitta or Kapha individually, or also from the combined discordance of all the three. Now listen to the etiology, differential diagnosis and symptoms of each of these types separately.
Etiology of each type
59-64. By pungent, bitter, astringent, very dry and cold articles of diet, or measured and limited diet, by fasting, excessive wayfaring, suppression, of the natural urges and excessive sexual indulgence, the Vata gets provoked and shrouding the gastric fire, renders it weak. In such a condition, the food is digested painfully. There is acid fermentation, roughness of limbs, dryness of throat and mouth, increase of hunger and thirst, faintness, noises in the ear and, frequent attacks of pain in the sides, thighs, groins and the neck. There is acute gastro-intestinal irritation, cardiac pain, emaciation, debility, dysgeusia, griping pain, craving for all kinds of tastes, asthenia of the mind, distension of stomach during and at the end ofdigestion, and relief after taking food. The condition of the patient may lead to a suspicion of Gulma of the Vata type, stomach-disorder or splenic disorder. In condition due to Vata, the patient passes stools frequently with painful straining for a long time and accompanied with sounds. The stools are liquid, dry, thin, undigested and frothy; and the patient is afflicted with cough and dyspnea.
65. The Pitta, getting provoked as a result of taking pungent, irritant, acid or alkaline articles of diet, or by pre-digestion meals, submerging the gastric fire, impairs its action just as hot water extinguishes the fire.
66. The patient passes undigested and liquid, bluish or yellowish stools and develops an icteric tinge, offensive acid eructations, heart-burn, throatburn, anorexia and thirst.
67. By indulgence in heavy, very unctuous, cold and other similar articles of diet, or by over-eating or sleeping immediately after meals, the Kapha, getting provoked, impairs the gastric fire.
68-70. The food is digested with difficulty and the patient suffers from nausea, vomiting and anorexia. There is increased secretion and sweet taste in his mouth; he is afflicted with cough, ptyalism and coryza; he feels as if his stomach is putrified and his abdomen becomes rigid and heavy. He has sweet and unpleasant eructations. There is asthenia, impotency and the flow of loose, undigested and heavy stools mixed with mucus. There is weakness despite the lack of emaciation and malaise in assimilation-disorder of the Kapha type.
71. The gastric conditions which have been described by me previously in the chapter on Disorders (chap. VI, Vimana), as of four kinds, I declare to be, also the cause of assimilation-disorders [grahani], with the exception among them of the one variety which is described as the normal gastric condition
72. That should be regarded as the condition of humoral tridiscordance wherein there is a combination of all the causes and symptoms which have been described as characteristic of Vata, Pitta and Kapha individually. Now hear me describe the treatment.
Treatment
73-73½. Finding that the patient’s organ of assimilation has become the seat of morbidity and contains accumulation of misdigested food, and that he is afflicted with intestinal stasis, ptyalism, colic, burning, anorexia and heaviness and knowing them to be signs of chyme-morbidity, the physician should administer emesis in genially warm water.
Or with the decoction of emetic-nut or long pepper and rape seeds in similar fashion. If the morbid chyme liquefied, or is lying in the colon undigested, the patient should be purged by means of stimulant drugs. If the morbid chyme be spread in the body along with the nutrient fluid, the patient should be made to fast and be given digestive drugs.
76. When his stomach has been thus cleansed, he should be given thin gruel prepared with the pentad of jujube group of drugs as well as light foods and digestive-stimulant preparations.
77. On finding the chyme to have fully ripened and the gastric disorder to be of the Vata type, the physician should administer, in a small doge, the ghee medicated with digestive-stimulant drugs.
78. When the gastric fire has been kindled to some extent, but the feces, urine and flatus have not yet been expelled, the patient should be oleated for two or three days, then subjected to sudation after prelimina-then administered evacuative enema.
79. When the Vata has been sedated, the patient with relaxed morbidity should be purged with either castor-oil or the Tilwaka-ghee, mixed with alkali.
80. If after the stomach has been cleansed, the stomach is devoid of unctuous quality and there is again constipation, unctuous enema should be given in proper dose, with the oil medicated with drugs that are stimulative of the gastric fire and curative of Vata.
81. The patient, who has been thus purged and given evacuative and unctuous enemata, should be fed on light foods and should again be given the systematic course of the ghee.
Medicated Ghees
82-86. Boil the decaradices and long-leaved pine, deodar, dry ginger, long pepper, roots of long pepper, white flowered leadwort, elephant pepper, seeds of bengal hemp, barley, jujube, horse-gram and black cumin seeds and Sauviraka wine; when the decoction is reduced to ¼ (1/4th) of its original quantity, prepare 256 tolas of ghee with this decoction; then add proper proportions of the salsoda and barley alkalis and also the powder of 8 tolas of each of rock-salt, efflorescence-salt, sea-salt, bid-salt, sambhar-salt, sanchala-salt and prepared salt. The wise physician may give this medicated gbee in a dose of eight tolas; it promotes gastric fire, vitality and complexion and is curative of Vata, and helps digestion of the food ingested. Thus has been described ‘The compound Decaradices Ghee’,
87. Prepare 32 tolas of ghee with the paste of 4 tolas each of the three spices, the three myrobalans and gur. The person with weak gastric fire may drink this medicated ghee in proper dose. Thus has been described ‘The compound Three Spices medicated Ghee’.
88-91. The ghee prepared with vinegar, the fresh juice of pomello and of ginger and the decoction of dried radish, jujube country sorrel, sour pomegranate, butter-milk, whey, the supernatant part of Sura wine, Tushodaka wine, or sour conjee, along with the paste of pentaradices, chebulic myrobalans, the three spices, roots of long pepper, rock-salt, Indian groundsel, the dyad of alkalis, cumin seeds, embelia and long zedoary—this medicated ghee is an excellent stimulant of the gastric fire and is curative of colic, Gulma, abdominal disease, dyspnea, cough and disorders due to Vata and Kapha. The physician may give this ghee prepared with the fresh juice of the citron.
92-93. The oil, prepared with the above mentioned drugs, may be used for inunction; or the patient may take these drugs in the form of powder with genially warm water. This powdermay be given for helping the digestion in a condition where the Vata is shrouded by Kapha or in perdition of disorders of chyme or Kapha provoked by Vata. This is a great stimulant of the gastric fire. Thus have been described ‘The compound Penta-radices Ghee and Powder.’
94. The undigested fecal mattersinks in water owing to its heaviness while the digested fecal matter floats in water except in conditions the feces are very watery or of hardened lumps, very cold and mixed with excessive mucus.
95.The physician should by this method, first investigate and find out whether the patient suffering from chyme disorder pisses undigested, matter or digested matter in his stools and then should treat him properly with digestive or other kinds of medications.
Remedies in Vata-type
96-97. Take white-flowered lead-wort, roots of long pepper, the two alkalis, the five salt, the three spices, asafoetida, celery seeds and chaba, pepper; mix them together and pulverise and prepare pills, adding the fresh juice of the citron or of the pomegranate. The pills help the digestion of the imperfectly digested food and quickly activate the gastric fire. Thus has been described ‘The compound White-flowered Leadwort Pills’.
98-99½. The decoction of dry ginger, Indian atees and nut grass helps digestion of the chyme. The paste of the above mentioned drugs or chebulic myrobalan or dry ginger taken with warm water acts similarly. In condition where the patient is passing undigested matter in the stools accompanied with colicky pain, he may be given the powder of deodar, sweet flag, nut grass, dry ginger, Indian atees, and chebulic myrobalans fermented in Varuni wine or with lukewarm water adding a small quantity of salt.
100-100½. Or, he may take with pomegranate juice the powder of bael, white flowered leadwort and dry ginger, salted with bid-salt in condition where the stools contain undigested matter and are mixed with mucus and where the Vata is causing intestinal colic.
101-102. The patient may take the powder of kurchi seeds, asafoetida. Indian atees, sweet flag, sanchal salt and chebulic myrobalans with warm water in conditions of vomiting, piles, tumors and colic. Or, the patient may take the powder of chebulic myrobalans, sanchal salt, cumin seeds and black pepper with warm water.
103-104. Take chebulic myrobalan, roots of long pepper, sweet flag, kurroa, Patha, kurchi seeds, white flowered leadwort and dry ginger, and make either a decoction or powder of these drugs. The patient may either drink the decoction or take the pulver with warm water. This remedy is beneficial and curative of colic occurring in persons suffering from assimilation-disorders [grahani] due to Pitta-cum-Kapha predominance.
105. In a condition where the patient is passing undigested fecal matter, the physician may use Indian atees, the three spices, salt, barley-alkali and asafoetida in the form of a decoction, or powder with lukewarm water.
106-107. Take long pepper, dry ginger, Patha, Indian sarsaparilla, yellow berried nightshade, Indian nightshade, white flowered leadwort, kurchi seeds and the pentad of salts, and give the patient the powder of these mixed with barley-alkali in either curds, warm water or Sura and other wines, for promoting the strength of the gastric fire. This powder is curative of morbid Vata in the gastro-intestinal tract.
108-110. Take 16 tolas each of black pepper, black cumin and false pareira brava, kokam butter, 40 tolas of Amlavetasa and 2 tolas of each of sanchal salt, bid-salt prepared salt, barley-alkali, rock-salt, zedoary, orris root, asafetida and gummy gardenia. Mix them together and reduce into a fine powder and give it to the patient. This is beneficial in assimilation-disorders where Vata is predominant as well as in anorexia. Thus has been described ‘The compound Black-pepper Powder’.
111-111½. Take 64 tolas of the tetrad of acid articles and 12 tolas of the three spices, 16 tolas of the salts and 32 tolas of sugar, and pulverize them well This powder may be used along with curries, soups, food and sauces. This is curative of cough, indigestion, anorexia, dyspnea, gastric disorders, anemia and colic.
112-114½. Take ½ tola each of chaba pepper, cinnamon, roots of long pepper, fulsee flower, the three spices, white-flowered leadwort, wood apple, bael, false pareira brava, silk cotton, elephant pepper, mineral pitch and cumin seeds, and pulverise them after frying m ghee; prepare a medicated gruel with this powder, adding curds, the juices of wood apple, country sorrel, kokam-butter and sour pomegranate. This gruel is curative of all kinds of diarrhea, assimilation-disorders [grahani], Gulma, piles and splenic disorders.
115-116. The soup of the pentad of jujubes or of radish along with black pepper and the prepared meat-juice of Jangala animals, acidified with pomegranate, butter-milk and unctuous articles, and the meat-juice of carnivorous, animals mixed with digestive articles are beneficial as food; and similarly butter-milk, fermented wheat-conjee and simple and medicated wines, are beneficial as drink.
Butter-milk in Vata type
117-119½. Butter-milk is considered to be the best in assimilation-disorders [grahani], owing to its digestive stimulant, astringent and light qualities. As it is sweet in post-digestive effect it does not provoke Pitta and owing to its being astringent, hot, antispasmodic and dry, it is beneficial m Kapha, as it is sweet, acid and dense it is beneficial in Vata Freshly prepared butter-milk is non-irritant. Therefore, the physician should make use of all the courses of butter-milk that have been described in the chapters on the treatment of abdominal diseases and piles, in the treatment of assimilationdisorders.
120-121. Take 12 tolas of each of celery seeds, erablic myrobalans, chebulic myrobalans and black pepper and 4 tolas each of the five kinds of salts and pulverise them together, put the powder m butter-milk and let it ferment. This, the patient should be given to drink. This butter-milk wine is a digestive-stimulant and is curative of edema, Gulma,piles, worms, urinary disorders and abdominal diseases. Thus has been described ‘The medicated Butter-milk Wine’.
Treatment in Pitta-type
122. Finding that the Pitta has gone to its natural habitat, that it is in an agitated condition and that it is extinguishing the gastric fire, the physician should remove it by emesis or by purgation.
123-124. By giving the patient non irritant and light foods, mixed with bitter substances or by giving the meat-juice of Jangala animals or the soup of green gram and other pulses or vegetable soups, acidified with pomegranate and mixed with ghee and the powders of digestive and astringent substances, or by giving ghees medicated with bitters, the physician should stimulate the gastric fire in the patient.
125-128. Take 8 tolas each of sandal-wood, Himalayan cherry, cuscus, cuscus-grass, Patha, trilobed virgin’s bower, Indian valerian, sweet flag, both varieties of Indian sarsaparilla, dita-bark, vasaka, snake-gourd, gular fig, holy fig, banyan, yellow-barked fig tree, flowering peepul, kurroa, rohan, nut-grass and neem, and decoct them in 1024 tolas of water. When reduced to ¼ of the quantity, prepare 64 tolas of medicated ghee in this decoction with the paste of 1 tola each of chiretta, kurchi seeds, climbing asparagus, long pepper and blue waterlily. This should be taken in assimilation disorders of the Pitta type. The ‘Bitter ghee’ described in the chapter entitled ‘The Therapeutics of Dermatosis’ may also be used. Thus has been described ‘The compound Sandal-wood Ghee’.
129-129¾. Take dry ginger, Indian, atees, nut-grass, fulsee flower, extract of Indian berberry, bark and seeds of kurchi, bael, Patha and kurroa in equal, parts and reduce to powder; this is to be taken with honey and rice-water. This compound Dry Ginger powder cures assimilation disorder [grahani] of the Pitta type.
130-131. It also cures a condition wherein the patient passes blood in his stools, piles, pain in the anorectal region and dysentery. This is valued highly by Krishna Atreya. Thus has been described ‘The compound Dry Ginger Powder.’
132-133. Take one part of each of chiretta, kurroa, the three spices, nutgrass and kurchi seeds and 2 parts of white-flowered leadwort and 16 parts of kurchi and reduce to powder; this powder, taken with gur and cold water, cures assimilation-disorders, Gulma, jaundice, fever, anemia, urinary disorders, anorexia and diarrhea. Thus has been described ‘The compound Chiretta Powder (No. 1)’.
134-136. Take sweet flag, Indian atees, Patha, dita bark, extract of Indian berberry, Indian calosanthes, fragrant sticky mallow, tree of heaven, kurchi bark, cretan prickly clover, Indian berberry, trailing rungia, Patha, celery seeds, drumstick, leaves of snake-gourd, white rape seeds, yellow-jasmine leaves, Spanish jasmine and the pulp of jambool, mango, bael and twigs and fruits of neem; the physician desirous of curing assimilation-disorders [grahani] should use this powder mixed with the compound chiretta powder.
137-140. Take chiretta, sweet flag, zalil, the three spices, sandal wood, Himalayan cherry, cuscus grass, bark of Indian berberry, kurroa, bark and seeds of kurchi, nut-grass, celery seeds, deodar, wild snake-gourd and leaves of neem, small cardamom, yellow ochre, Indian atees, cinnamon, seeds of drumstick, trilobed virgin’s bower and trailing rungia. The powder of these may be licked with honey or drunk mixed with wine or water. This will cure gastric disorders, Gulma, colic, anorexia, fever, jaundice, tridiscordance and diseases of the mouth. Thus has been described ‘The compound Chiretta Powder (No. 2)’.
Treatment in Kapha type
141. When the assimilation system has been impaired by the morbid Kapha, the patient should be subjected to systematic procedure of emesis, and thereafter his gastric fire may be stimulated by the use of pungent, acid, salt, alkaline and bitter articles.
142-143. Take one tola of each of Palasha, white-flowered leadwort, chaba pepper, pomello, chebulic myrobalans, long pepper, roots of long pepper, Patha, dry ginger and coriander and boil them in 64 tolas of water; when reduced to ¼ (l/4th) the quantity, take it down. This may be used as potion by itself or. a gruel may be prepared with the above-mentioned drugs.
144. Or, the patient may take light food with the soup of dry radish or of horse-gram mixed with pungent, acid, alkaline and stimulant articles.
145. He may take a post-prandial, drink of sour butter-milk, medicated butter-milk, wine or Madira wine or honey wine or wholesome Sidhu wine.
146-148. Take 1024 tolas of flowers of mahwa, 512 tolas of embelia, 256 tolas of each of white flowered leadwort and marking nut, and- 32 tolas of indian madder; decoct all these in 3072 tolas of water. When it is reduced to 1024 tolas, take it down. When. it is cooled, mix it with 128 tolas of honey and place it in a pot lined with the paste of cardamom, lotus stalks, eagle wood and sandal wood and keep it for a month; when the' wine is properly fermented, it should be taken out for use.
149. This mahwa-wine stimulates the assimilatory system and is roborant. It is curative of Kapha, Pitta, edema, dermatosis, leucoderma and urinary disorders. Thus has been described ‘The Mahwa-wine.’
150. Take the fresh juice of mahwa flowers and boil it till it is reduced to ½ (1/2nd) its quantity; when it is cooled, add ¼ (1/4th) its quantity of honey and place it in a pot as described in the preceding preparation.
151. The person observing wholesome diet will be able to subdue all assimilation-disorders [grahani] by taking this medicated wine. The patient may take the wines, prepared in the same way, from the juice of grapes, sugarcane and dates.
152-154. Take 128 tolas of cretan prickly clover, 64 tolas of emblic myrobalan, 8 tolas each of white flowered leadwort; and red physic nut and take a hundred fresh chebulic myrobalans and deeoct these in; 4096 tolas of water; and when the water is reduced to 1024 tolas and cooled, filter and add to it 800 tolas of gur and 32 tolas of honey; and as described above, place it in a vessel lined with ghee adding 16 tolas of the powder of perfumed cherry, long pepper aud embelia. It must remain there for a fortnight and when the wine is well formed, it should be taken.
155. It is curative of assimilation disorders [grahani], anemia, piles, dermatosis, acute spreading affections, urinary disorders, hemothermia and disorders of Kapha; it is a promoter of the voice and the complexion. Thus has been described ‘The Prickly Clover Wine’.
156-158. Take 20 tolas of each of turmeric, decaradices, climbing asparagus, Rishabhaka and Jivaka, and decoct them in 4096 tolas of water; when it is reduced to ¼ (l/4th) its quantity the solution should be filtered aud the physician should add 800 tolas of gur and the powder made of 8 tolas of perfumed cherry, nut grass, Indian madder, embelia, liquorice, nut-grass, white lodh, red lodh, and honey. Keep it for a month and then use it
159. The Radices-wine thus prepared is digestive-stimulant, curative of hemothermia, constipation, disorders of Kapha, gastric disorders, anemia and asthenia of body. Thus has been described ‘The Radices-wines’.
160-161. Triturate 64 tolas of each of long pepper, gur, pulp of beleric myrobalan; add 64 tolas of water and keep the vessel containing it in a heap of barley; when it is well fermented, the patient may take a dose of 4 tolas of it mixed with 16 tolas of water. This Pinda-wine is curative of a multitude of diseases.
162. Even the healthy man desirous of preventing for himself the diseases described herein, may take this wine for a month as a prophylactic measure, living on a diet of meat-juice mixed with unctuous substances. Thus has been described ‘The Pinda-wine’.
163-165½. Take a new pot and line it with long pepper and honey; fumigate it with eagle wood and put into it 256 tolas of honey, equal amount of water and the following powders—embelia 8 tolas, long pepper 16 tolas, 4 tolas of bamboo manna and one tola each of fragrant poon and black pepper, and of cinnamon, cardamom, cinnamon leaves, long zedoary, betel nut, Indian atees, nut-grass, fragrant piper, cherry tree, Indian tooth-ache tree, roots of long pepper and white flowered leadwort; keep this for a month and then make use of it.
166-167. It stimulates the weak gastric fire and regulates the irregular one. This honey-wine cures gastric disorders, dermatosis, piles, edema, fever and other disorders due to Vata and Kapha. Thus has been described ‘The Honey-wine.’
168-169. Take equal parts of long pepper, roots of long pepper, the two alkalis, the five salts, pomello, chebulic myrobalans, Indian groundsel, long zedoary, black pepper and dry ginger and reduce them to powder; the patient suffering from assimilation-disorder of the Kapha type may drink it in the morning with genially warm water; it is a promoter of vitality, complexion and the gastric fire.
170. And if this condition is associated with Vata, the ghee prepared with the above drugs may be taken or the ‘Shatpala ghee’ or ‘Marking nut ghee’ described in the chapter on Gulma may be taken.
The Alkali-ghee
171-172. Take bid salt, sanchal salt, salsoda salt, barley-alkali, soap-pod, Indian nightshade and white flowered leadwort and incinerate; then wash and percolate it seven times in water. Take 572 tolas of this alkaline solution and prepare 256 tolas of ghee with this. This ghee when taken as potion promotes the gastric fire. Thus has been described ‘The Alkali-ghee.’
Alkali Recipes
173-176. Take one tola of each of long pepper and roots of long pepper, Patha, chaba pepper, kurchi seeds, dry ginger, white-flowered leadwort, Indian atees, asafoetida, small caltrops, kurroa and sweet flag, and 4 tolas each of the pentad of salts; mix these in 128 tolas of curds and 32 tolas of oil-cum-ghee and boil them on a low fire, till the watery portion is evaporated; then break up the mass formed and carbonize it by the air-tight method and deduce it to powder. The patient may take as potion one tola of this powder mixed in ghee, and when the dose is digested he should take a meal consisting of sweet articles. This will cure all disorders of Vata and Kapha as well as conditions of acute and chronic poisoning.
177-178. Take 8 tolas of each of marking nut, the three spices, the three myrobalans, the triad of salts and carbonize them with the fire of the cowdung-cakes, by the airtight method. This alkali, taken with ghee or taken sprinkled over the food, cures gastric disorders, anemia, assimilation-disorders [grahani], Gulma, misperistalsis and colic.
179-180. Take equal parts of cretan prickly clover, Indian beech and jungle cork-tree, dita bark, kurchi bark, sweet-flag, emetic nut, trilobed virgin’s bower, Patha and purging cassia; reduce them to powder and mixing it with cow’s urine, incinerate. The alkali is thus produced, is a promoter of the strength of the assimilatory system.
181. Chiretta, kurroa, wild snake-gourd, neem and trailing rungia, should be mixed with buffalo’s urine and incinerated. The alkali produced thus is a promoter of the gastric fire.
182. Turmeric, Indian berberry, sweet flag, costus, white-flowered leadwort, kurroa and nut-grass should be mixed with goat’s urine and incinerated. The alkali thus produced acts as a promoter of the gastric fire.
183-185. Take 16 tolas of thorny milk hedge, 12 tolas of the triad of salts, 16 tolas of brinjal, 32 tolas of mudar and 8 tolas of white-flowered leadwort. This should be burnt to ashes and an alkali prepared; pills made of this with the juice of the brinjal, may be taken after each meal. These pills help in quickly digesting the food taken repeatedly. It is beneficial in cough, dyspnea, piles, acute gastrointestinal irritation, coryza and in gastric disorders. These alkali-pills are valued highly by Krishna Atreya. Thus has been described ‘The Alkali-pills’.
186-187. Take kurchi, Indian atees, Patha, cretan prickly clover, asafoetida and white-flowered leadwort; powder them and boil that powder in an iron pot with the alkali of the buds of palas prepared in cow’s urine, till it becomes dense. The patient suffering from assimilation disorders, edema or piles should take a dose of half a tola of this powder with genially warm water or with wine. Thus has been described ‘The Fourth Variety of Alkali’.
188-191½. Take one tola each of the three myrobalans, white siris, chaba pepper, pulp of bael, iron-dust, kurroa, nut grass, costus, Patha, asafoetida, liquorice, the alkalis, of weaver’s bean tree, and of barley, the three spices, sweet flag, embelia, roots of long pepper, sal soda salt, neem, white flowered leadwort, trilobed virgin’s bower, celery seeds, kurchi seeds, guduch, deodar and 4 tolas of each of the pentad of salts, and soak them in 48 tolas of curds and 48 tolas of ghee and oil, and heating it slowly on a low fire by the airtight method, prepare the alkali. The patient suffering from piles, assimilation-disorders [grahani] and anemia due to Kapha and Vata may take a dose of one tola of this alkali mixed with ghee.
192-193½. This alkali-preparation is curative of splenic disorders, retention of urine, dyspnea, hiccup, cough, worms, fever, consumption, diarrhea, edema, urinary disorders, constipation, cardiac spasm and all kinds of toxicosis; this alkali-preparation is also an excellent promoter of gastric fire. After this dose has been digested the patient should take his diet mixed with sweet meat-juice or with milk. Thus has been described ‘The Fifth Variety of Alkali’.
Treatment in Tridiscordance-type
194-194½. In a condition of tridiscordance, the physician skilled in systematic treatment should first administer the pentad of purificatory procedures and should then give medicated ghee, alkalis and simple or medicated wines which promote the gastric fire.
195-195½. The physician skilled, in constitutional pathology, should administer the line of treatment indicated in assimilation disorders due to each of Vata and other humors either separately or combined together.
List of Therapies applicable
196-197½. Oleation, sudation, purification and lightening therapies, articles that are gastric stimulants, various kinds of powders, salts, alkalis, honey, medicated wine, Sura wine and simple wines, various kinds of buttermilk courses, and disgestive stimulant ghees should be resorted to, by the patient suffering from assimilationdisorders [grahani].
Treatment at each stage
198-200½. Now hear the treatment at different stages of the disease. In ptyalism due to Kapha type of the disease, dry digestive-stimulants mixed with bitter articles should be given. In a condition of emaciation with excess of Kapha, an alternate administration of the dry and the unctuous articles is beneficial; after ascertainment of the absence of chymemorbidity, digestive-stimulants mixed with unctuous bitter and sweet articles should be given. If the Vata is in excess, digestive-stimulants mixed with unctuous, salt and acid articles are beneficial. The gastric fire fed by the fuel of such a regimen gets rekindled.
201-201½. Treatment with unctuous articles should be known to be the best stimulant of a weak gastric fire. There is no food, however heavy, that can quench the gastric fire activated by the fuel of unctuous substances.
202 202½. The patient, whose gastric fire is weak and who passes frequent stools of undigested fecal matter, should take in proper dose, the ghee medicated with digestive-stimulants.
203-203½. The Samana Vata, getting corrected, gets re-established in its normal habitat. Due to its movement towards the seat of the gastric fire, it quickly enhances the strength of the gastric fire.
204-205. The person who passes stools with difficulty owing to its formation into scybalous masses, should drink ghee mixed with salt in the midst of his meal; and in a condition of the gastric fire being weakened by dryness, he may drink ghee or oil mixed with digestive-stimulants.
Treatment in gastric dullness
206-207. If the gastric fire is weak owing to over-unctuousness, then powders or medicated and simple wines are beneficial. If the stools are loose due to excessive mucus-secretion in the rectum, the patient should take oils or Sura or other wines. If the gastric fire is weak due to misperistalsis, evacuative and unctuous enemata are indicated; and if the weakness is due to excess of humoral morbidity in the body, he should undergo purificatory procedures and observe systematic regimen.
208-208½. If the gastric fire is weak in one already suffering from disease, ghee is the only stimulant of such gastric fire. If the gastric fire is weak owing to fasting, ghee mixed with gruel should be taken; and ghee taken in the course of a meal is a promoter of strength, digestive-stimulant and roborant.
209-211½. The physician should give light food mixed with meat-juice of the tearer and carnivorous groups of creatures, slightly acidified, to persons who are weak, wasted and emaciated by very prolonged illness. Such flesh, owing to its acute and hot quality, purifies and activates the gastric fire quickly; and as it is formed of the flesh of other animals, it acts as a very quick roborant. The gastric fire is not kindled by either fasting, under-eating or over-eating, just as a fire does not get enkindled by either lack of fuel, or inadequate fuel or by being smothered by excess of fuel.
212-212½. When the regimen of various unctuous articles of diet, powders, decoctive wines, Sura and other wines hava been properly administered by the physician, the strength of the gastric fire begins to increase.
213-213½. Just as the fire, fed by a hard and strong wood, burns steadily and long, so does the gastric fire get steadily established, which is fed by a regimen of unctuous diet.
214-214½. He enjoys good health for long, who eats what is whole some, who eats only after the previous meal has been digested, and who eats in moderation. Man should constantly strive to promote the gastric fire by taking care to prevent the discordance of body-elements.
215-215½. When the gastric fire established in the centre of the body is evenly maintained by the proper balance of humors, it digests the food well and promotes health, robustness, life-span and strength.
216-216½. When it is rendered weak or very severe by the morbid humors, it gives birth to diseases. The weak condition of the gastric fire, thus, has been fully described; and the severe condition of the gastric fire will now be taken up.
Treatment in gastric severity
217-217½. In one suffering from decrease of the Kapha, the Pitta gets provoked and following the course of the Vata, reaches the seat of the gastric fire and increases its strength by adding its own heat.
218-219. Having been thus enhanced, the gastric fire combined with the Vata in the body in which the unctuous quality has been lessened, surrounds the food and quickly digests it by its acuteness, as many times as it is offered. Having consumed the food, it begins to consume the bodyelements such as blood etc.
220-220½. The man is then afflicted with debility and diseases leading to death. He is pacified when he has ingested his food, but immediately on completion of digestion, he feels fainting. Thirst, dyspnea, burning
and fainting etc., are the disorders resulting from excessive or very acute gastric fire (hyperchlorhydria).
221-221½. As a burning fire is quenched by water, similarly the very acute gastric fire should be brought to quiescence by means of heavy, unctuous, sweet and viscous food and drink.
222-222½. Even before the digestion of the food is completed, the patient should repeatedly feed, lest the gastric fire should, at any time, go without fuel and begin to feed on the body elements, thus giving rise to complications.
223-223½. He should feed on milk-pudding, kedgeree, unctuous pastry, products of gur and the spit-roasted meat of aquatic and wet-land creatures.
224-224½. He should take particularly fish that are smooth and live in stagnant waters, and the spit-roasted meat of sheep, both of which relieve the acute condition of the gastric fire.
225-226. When hungry, the patient should take gruel mixed with bee’s wax or take ghee or the supernatant part of the porridge of wheat-powder after undergoing venesection, or he may take the milk that has been prepared with sugar, ghee and the life-promoter group of drugs,
227. The bruised oleiferous seeds taken mixed with sugar and similarly meat-juices taken mixed with unctuous substances, reduce the gastric fire to a mild condition,
228. The patient may take ghee in cold water mixed with bee’s wax or he may take powdered wheat with milk and ghee.
229-230. The three unctuous substances, leaving oil from the group of the unctuous articles, prepared with the meat-juice of wet-land creatures, or curds mixed with equal quantity of milk and the aforesaid unctuous substances may be taken, or the powdered bark of the gular fig mixed in breast-milk, or the milk-pudding prepared with both of these may be taken for the relief of the severe condition of the gastric fire.
231-231½. The patient may be given repeated purgation by the wise and expert physician, after investigation, with milk prepared with black turpeth and turpeth, for allaying Pitta it should be followed by a diet of milk-pudding.
232-232½. Sleeping in the day after meals and whatever articles are sweet, fatty, promotive of Kapha and heavy, are beneficial in a severe condition of the gastric fire.
233-233½. The patient afflicted with acute gastric fire does not come to grief by eating sumptuously of fatty articles of diet, even without feeling hungry, but gains in robustness, on the contrary.
234-234½. When the Kapha is increased and the Pitta and Vata are subdued, the gastric fire, regaining its normality, digests the food and maintains the balanced condition of the body-elements, thus promoting robustness, life-span and strength.
Here are verses again—
235-236½. In this treatise, that is regarded as mixed diet (Samaśana [samaśana]) in which the wholesome and the unwholesome are mixed together. The irregular diet (Viṣamaśana [viṣamaśana]) is that which is either excessive or scanty or eaten either too early or too late. That meal is regarded as (Adhyaśana [adhyaśana]) predigestion-meal which is taken before the previous meal has been digested. All three kinds of abnormal eating give rise to either death or dreadful diseases.
237-238. Taking the evening meal even though the morning meal has not been digested, is not injurious. The heart is awakened by the sun in the day like the lotus. When it is awake, all the channels of the body are fully dilated.
239. They dilate by exertion, movement and mental activity. Hence it is that the body-elements in these channels do not get softened in the day.
240-240½. When new food is mixed with old which is not softened, it does not get spoilt, even as fresh milk added to milk which has not been sour, does not get spoilt by it, but gets well-mixed with it.
241-242. But in the night when the heart gets contracted and the channels as well as the gastro-intestinal tract are contracted, the body-elements get softened. Any thing else added to these which are undigested and softened get spoilt even as boiled milk added to sour milk,
243. When the food eaten in the night is not fully digested, the wise man, desiring to protect his strength and life, should not take any food.
Summary
Here are the recapitulatory verses—
244-249. The characteristics of the gastric fire, how it preserves the body, how the food is digested, and what things food creates and how, the various kinds of body-fire and what they nourish, their number and what elements they ripen, the order of the transformations of body-elements such as nutrient fluid etc., as well as the excretory matter given out by each of them, the causes for the quick efficacy of virilific drugs, the time and order of the formation of the body-elements, the cause of the localisation of disease, the significance of the gastric fire, how it vitiates the metabolism when it is increased, what diseases it gives rise to when vitiated, the definition of the assimilatory system, the signs and symptoms of assimilation-disorders [grahani], the premonitory symptoms of each type, its signs and symptoms and therapeutics, the description of the four kinds of assimilation-disorders, and treatment of various stages of disease, the etiology of the severe condition of the gastric fire and its treatment—all this the sage has expounded in this chapter on ‘The Therapeutics of Assimilation-disorders’.
15. Thus, in the Section on Therapeutics in the treatise -compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the fifteenth chapter entitled ‘The Therapeutics of Assimilation-disorders [grahani-dosha-cikitsa]’ not being available, the same as restored by Drdhabala, is completed.
Varieties
3. Anemia [pandu-roga] is considered to be of five kinds viz., the three due to the provocation of Vata, Pitta and Kapha individually, the fourth due to the provocation of all these three combined, and the fifth due to geophagism (earth-eating).
4. The man in whose body elements the morbid humors get provoked, with Pitta in predominance, in that mau those body-elements grow flabby and heavy.
5. Thereafter the complexion, vitality, unctuousness and other qualities of the vital essence become excessively diminished as a result of the morbidity of humors as well as of the body-elements.
6 In consequence, the person becomes depleted in blood and fat and devitalized and suffers from asthenia of the sense-organs and discoloration of the skin. Now listen to a description of the etiology and signs and symptoms of anemia.
Etiology
7-11½. By indulgence in alkaline acid, salt, very hot, antagonistic and unwholesome diet, by habitual indulgence in legumes, black gram, oilcake and til oil; by resorting to day sleep, physical exercise and sexual congress while the food is still undigested; by irregular performance of the quinary purificatory procedures, by abnormality of the seasons, and by suppression of natural urges, the Pitta which is in the normal condition in the heart gets provoked; it also occurs in persons whose minds have been affected with passion, anxiety, fright, wrath or grief. This Pitta, being expelled by the powerful Vata and passing into the ten main arteries, spreads through them in the entire body and becomes lodged in the space between the skin and the flesh. Then, by vitiating the Kapha, Vata, blood, skin and flesh, it produces whitish, yellowish or greenish or various other discolorations of the skin. This condition is called anemia[panduroga].
Premonitory symptoms
12. Its premonitory symptoms are—cardiac palpitation, dryness, anidrosis and fatigue
Sips and symptoms
13-16. When the disease has fully manifested itself, there occur all the following symptoms—the patient becomes afflicted with tinnitus, loss of gastric fire, weakness, asthenia, repugnance for food, fatigue, giddiness, pain in the limbs, fever, dyspnea, heaviness and anorexia He feels as though his limbs have been kneaded, squeezed and pounded; his eyelids are swollen; he is greenish in bodytinge, his hair falls off, he suffers loss of body-lustre, he becomes irritable, dislikes cold things, develops sleepiness, ptyalism, and taciturnity, complains of cramps in the legs and pain and flabbiness in the waist, thighs and feet when climbing or exerting himself in other ways. We shall now give a detailed description of this disease.
Vata type
17-18. The Vata, getting provoked by Vata-promoting diet and behaviour causes the swarthy type of pallor, dry-brown coloration of the limbs, body-ache, pain, pricking pain, tremors, pain in the side of the body and in the head, dehydration of feces, dysgeusia, edema, constipation and loss of vitality.
Pitta type
19. The Pitta getting provoked by the particular Pitta-provoking factors and getting accumulated in the body of the person of the Pittahabitus, vitiates the blood and other body-elements and causes [anemia?].
20-22. The person becomes yellowish or greenish in tinge, afflicted with fever and burning, has craving for fluids, fainting and thirst; he passes yellowish urine and feces, perspires excessively, craves for cold things, does not relish food and has a pungent taste in the mouth. Hot as well as acid things are not homo-logatory to him, and he suffers from acid eructations and heart-burn due to the misdigestion of food, and also from body-fetor, looseness of stools, prostration and faintness.
Kapha type
23-25. Similarly, the Kapha getting increased by Kapha-promoting factors, causes anemia[pandu-roga] having the following symptoms—heaviness, torpor, vomiting, sallow complexion, ptyalism, horripilation, asthenia, fainting, giddiness, exhaustion, dyspnea, cough, lethargy, anorexia, loss of speech and voice, whiteness of urine, eyes and feces; craving for pungent, dry and hot things, edema and sweet taste in the mouth. This is the anemia due to Kapha.
26. In a person who indulges in all varieties of food, all the three humors get simultaneously provoked and cause a very severe type of anemia[panduroga] having a syndrome of the symptoms of tridiscordance.
Geophagic type
27-30. In one who is addicted to earth-eating, any of three three humors may become provoked. Earth of the atsringent taste provokes Vata; that of saltish taste provokes Pitta and that of sweet taste provokes Kapha. Earth when eaten, dehydrates the nutrient fluid and the other body-elements on account of its quality of dryness, and not being digested in the body, it (the earth) fills the body-channels and causes obstruction. Then, impairing the tone of the senses, secretory system, lustre, and vital essence, it causes anemia and soon diminishes vitality, complexion and the gastric fire. The patient develops edema of the cheek, eyelid and brow; his feet, navel aud genitals become edematous; he develops intestinal worms and diarrhea and his stools are mixed with mucus and blood.
Incurable Types
31-33. The patient in whom the anemia[pandu-roga] has been of long duration and has led to excessive dehydration of the body, or the patient who has developed edema on account of the long duration of the disease and whose vision has become yellow, or the patient who passes frequent, yellow, hardened and scanty stools mixed with mucus, or the patient who has become depressed in spirit and pale and whose body has become excessively clammy and who is afflicted with vomiting, fainting and thirst, or the patient, who, in consequence of loss of blood, has developed pronounced pallor—all these types of anemia do not get cured. Thus have been described the signs and symptoms of ‘The five varieties of Anemia’.
34. If the anemic person indulges inordinately in Pitta-promoting things, the Pitta in him gets aggravated and consuming the blood and flesh in his body, leads to further disease.
35-36. Thus, his eyes become extremely yellow and likewise his skin, nails and face become yellow; he passes urine and feces of reddish or yellowish color; his skin-color is yellow like that of a frog; his senses are impaired and he is afflicted with burning, mis-digestion, prostration, asthenia and anorexia. This condition known as Kamala or jaundice is caused by the excess of Pitta and its seats of affection are both the gastro-intestinal tract and the peripheral tissues. In course of time, the jaundice becomes deep-seated and formidable; this is called Kumbha-Kamala.
37-38½. The patient passes feces and urine of dark yellow color and develops severe edema; his eyes and face appear red and his vomit, feces and urine are tinged with blood; he has tremors; he is afflicted with burning, anorexia, thirst, constipation, torpor and faintness; he suffers from loss of the gastric fire as well as of consciousness; such a subject of jaundice will soon die.
39. Now we shall describe the treatment of the remaining conditions which are curable.
Treatment
40. The patient suffering from anemia[panduroga] should be made to undergo oleation procedure and then be cleansed with strong emesis and purgation. The patient suffering from jaundice should be cleansed with mild and bitter purgative remedies
41-41½. After the alimentary system has thus been cleansed by these procedures, he should be given wholesome food, namely, old rice, barley br wheat, either with soup prepared of green gram, pigeon-pea or lentils, or with wholesome meat juice of Jangala creatures.
42-43. According to the particular morbidity in each of these two conditions, medication should be carried out. The medicated ghees viz., Pancagavya (chap. X Cik.), Mahatikta (chap. VII Cik.) or Kalyanaka (Chap. IX Cik.) may be given for oleation purposes in the patient suffering from jaundice and anemia.
Medicated Ghees
44-46. The medicated ghee prepared of eighty tolas of cow’s ghee, in 256 tolas of water, with the paste
16 tolas of pomegranate, 8 tolas of coriander, 4 tolas of white*flowered leadwort, 4 tolas of dry ginger and 2 tolas of long pepper, is curative of gastric disorders, anemia, Gulma, piles, splenic disorder and disorders due to Vata and Kapha.

Prepare also another medicated ghee from the decoction of twenty tolas of Indian berberry, two tolas of the paste of yellow sandalwood and 64 tolas of buffalo’s ghee. The first ghee is indicated in anemia and the second one in jaundice.
55-59½. If as the result of treatment by the aforesaid unctuous remedies, the anemia-patient is found to be rendered sufficiently unctuous, he should thereafter be subjected to frequent purgation by means of pure cow’s milk or cow’s milk mixed with cow’s urine. The patient may be given a purgative which is also curative of anemia consisting of the lukewarm decoction of red physic nut, either cooked with 16 tolas of white teak or mixed with 16 tolas of triturated grapes. The anemia-patient with provoked Pitta should take a potion of 2 tolas of turpeth with twice that measure of sugar, while the anemia-patient with an excess of Kapha should take with cow's urine the powder of chebulic myrobalans soaked in cow’s urine. The patient may take purging cassia, the three spices and bael leaves mixed with the juice of the sugar-cane, white yam and emblic myrobalan for the cure of jaundice. The jaundice-patient may take either the paste of red physic nut ½ tola with twice the quantity of gur, in cold water or the powder of turpeth in the juice of the three myrobalans.
60-62½. Take one tola each of colocynth, the three myrobalans, nutgrass, costus, deodar and kurchi seeds half a tola of atees and two tolas of trilobed virgin’s bower, and crushing the whole in sufficient quantity of water, reduce to paste and strain. This as potion should be taken and immediately after, honey should be licked. This medicament cures cough, dyspnea, fever,. burning, anemia[pandu-roga], anorexia, Gulma, constipation, chyme and Vata disorders, as also hemothermia.
63-63½. The patient suffering from jaundice should take early in the morning the cold infusion of the three myrobalans or guduch or Indian berberry or neem mixed with honey.
64-64½. The anemia-patient should take for a period of a fortnight the course of cow’s or buffalo’s urine cum milk; or he may take for a period of seven days the decoction of the three myrobalans mixed with cow’s urine.
65-65½. Take tender sprouts of pomelo and having roasted them on the fire, quench and crush them up in cow’s urine. A potion of its filtered solution i« curative of edema induced by anemia[panduroga].
66 67. The patient may take the yellow milk plant, white and black turpeths, deodar and dried ginger either reduced to paste in 16 tolas of cows urine or decocted in the cow’s urine or boiled in cow’s milk. This medicament is promotive of the elimination of the waste products in the body.
68. Or, the patient may take a course of the chebulic myrobalan in conjunction with cow’s urine. On the dose being digested, he should take his meals mixed either with milk or with sweet meat-juices.
69. Or, the physician should cause the patient to drink, for the cure of anemia[pandu-roga], the iron-powder soaked in cows urine along with milk, for a period of seven days.

Boil it in 8 times its quantity of cow’s urine and then add the above powder to it; prepare pills, each of one tola in weight. The patient may take these pills with butter-milk according to the strength of his gastric fire, and when it is digested, he should take a wholesome meal. These iron-rust pills give new life to the patient suffering from anemia. They also alleviate dermatosis, indigestion, edema, spastic paraplegia, disorders of Kapha, piles, jaundice and urinary anomalies. Thus have been described ‘The Iron-rust Pills’.
78-79½. Take 20 tolas of iron pyrites, mineral pitch, silver andiron-rust and 4 tolas of white flowered leadwort, the three myrobalans, the three spices, embelia and 32 tolas of sugar; pulverise and mix them together. This powder should be habitually taken in a dose of 1 tola, mixed liberally with honey. The patient should avoid horse-gram, black night-shade and the flesh of pigeon and should resort to a wholesome and moderate diet after the dose is digested.
80-84½. Take three parts of the three myrobalans and three parts of the three spices, one part of white flowered leadwort and of embelia, 5 parts of mineral pitch and similarly of silver rust and yellow pyrites and pure iron powder, and 8 parts of sugar; make a very fine powder of all these and mixing it liberally with honey, put it in a clean metallic receptacle. The person may take from it a dose of one tola, according to his digestive power. It should be habitually taken and when the dose is digested, he should take his food ad libitum, avoiding horsegram, black nightshade and flesh of pigeon. This recipe is called Yogaraja or sovereign recipe and is comparable to ambrosia in its effects.
85-86½. This is a supreme vitalizer, panacea and blessing. It cures anemia [panduroga], toxicosis, cough, consumption, irregular fever, dermatosis, indigestion, urinary disorders, dehydration, dyspnea and anorexia, and it cures particularly epilepsy, jaundice and piles. Thus has been described ‘The Yogaraja, the sovereign recipe’.
87-90½. Take 32 tolas of mineral pitch, impregnate it with the juices of kurchi seeds, the three myrobalans, neem, snake gourd, nut grass and dry ginger for 10, 20 or 30 days; add to it 32 tolas of white sugar and 4 tolas of each of bamboo manna, long pepper, emblic myrobalans and galls, and 4 tola, of the entire plant of Indian-nightshade and the powder of the three fragrant substances—cinnamon, cardamom and mace; pulverise all of them and mix with 12 tolas of honey and prepare into pills of one tola each. The patient may take them on an empty stomach or after meals followed by a drink of the juice of pomegranate or of milk or meat-juice of birds, or of water, or Sura or other wines.
91-92½. These pills cure anemia [pandu-roga], dermatosis, fever, splenic disorders, asthma, piles, fistula-in-ano, fetor-oris, gastric disorders, disorders of semen urine and of the gastric fire, consumption, chronic poisoning, abdominal diseases, cough, menorrhagia, hemothermia, edema, Gulma, diseases of the throat and all kinds of wounds. These pills are a panacea for all diseases and are a blessing. Thus has been described ‘The Mineral Bitch Pills’.
93-95. Take 4 tolas of hog's weed, turpeth, the three spices, embelia, deodar, white flowered leadwort, costus, turmeric, Indian berberry, the three myrobalans, red physic-nut, chaba pepper, kurchi seeds, long pepper, roots of long pepper and nut-grass; take double this quantity of iron-rust and boil in 512 tolas of cow’s urine and mix the aforesaid powder in it and prepare pills of half tola each. The patient may take well mixed with butter-milk.
96. These pills cure anemia [panduroga], splenic disorders, piles, irregular fever, edema, assimilation-disorders, dermatosis, and helminthiasis; thus has been described ‘The Hog’s weed Iron-rust’.
97. The patient suffering from jaundice and anemia may lick the powder prepared of the bark of Indian berberry, the three myrobalans, the three spices, embelia and iron-powder mixed with honey and ghee.
98. The patient suffering from jaundice may lick the powder prepared of equal quantity of iron-powder, chebulic myrobalan and turmeric, with honey and ghee, or the powder of chebulic myrobalan with gur and honey.
99. The linctus prepared of the powder of the three myrobalans, turmeric, Indian berberry, kurroa and iron-powder, mixed with honey and ghee, is curative of jaundice.
100-101½. Take 8 tolas of bamboo manna, dry ginger and liquorice, and 64 tolas of long pepper and grapes, and 200 tolas of white sugar. Prepare this powder into a linctus by boiling it in 1024 tolas of the juice of emblic myrobalan; when it is cold, add 64 tolas of honey. This should be taken as a linctus in the dose of one tola at a time. It cures jaundice, anemia, excess of Pitta, cough and Halimaka [halīmaka]. Thus has been described ‘The linctus of the Emblic Myrobalan’.
102-104½. Take equal quantities of the three spices, the three myrobalans, chaba pepper, white-flowered leadwort, deodar, embelia, nutgrass and kurchi bark; pulverise all these and adding an equal quantity of iron-rust, boil the whole in eight times the quantity of cow’s urine. The cooking should be done over a low fire and when the preparation is cooled, make pills of one tola each. These should be taken according to one’s digestive power. They are curative of splenic disorders, anemia, assimilatiou-disorders and piles; the patient should take a diet of butter-milk and barley-meal during the course of treatment. Thus has been described ‘The iron-rust Pill’.
Medicated Wines
105-105½. The medicated gur wine prepared with Indian madder, turmeric, grapes, roots of sida, iron-powder and lodh is beneficial for the patients suffering from anemia [pandu-roga]. Thus has been described ‘The Medicated Gur-wine’.
106-110½. Decoct 64 tolas of the kino tree, 80 tolas of the three myrobalans, 20 tolas of grapes and 28 tolas of lac in 1024 tolas of water; when it is reduced to half its quantity, filter it and when cold add 64 tolas of honey and a tola of each of the three spices, shell, cuscus grass, betel nut, cherry tree, mahwa and costus and put the mixture in a pot saturated with ghee, under a heap of common barley for ten nights in summer, and double that number in the cold season and then it should be prescribed as potion. It is curative of assimilation-disorder, anemia, piles, edema, Gulma, dysuria, lithiasis, urinary disorders, jaundice and tridiscordance. The preparation of this medicated wine of the Indian kino tree has been propounded by Atreya. Thus has been described ‘The Kinotree Medicated-wine’.
111-1124. Extract by pressure the juice of 2000 emblic myrobalans and then mix the juice with ½ its quantity of honey and 8 tolas of long pepper and 200 tolas of sugar, and then keep it in a ghee-pot for a fortnight. This should be drunk in proper dosage in the morning and the rules of beneficial dietetic regimen observed.
113-113½. This is curative of jaundice, anemia [panduroga], cardiac diseases, rheumatic conditions, fevers of irregular type, cough, hiccup, anorexia and dyspnea. Thus has been described ‘The Medicated Emblic Myrobalan Wine’.
114-114½. The water decocted with the drugs of the ticktrefoil group is recommended for use in the dietary of the anemia-patients and as regards those suffering from jaundice, the juice of grapes and of emblic myrobalans is recommended.
115-116½. Thus, the measures for the cure of anemia have been expounded by the great sage. The physician should administer these according to the predominant morbid humors and the vitality of the patient. In anemia due to predominance of Vata-provocation, the treatment must be chiefly by unctuous medications. In anemia due to predominance of Pitta, the treatment must be chiefly by bitter aud cooling medicaments. In anemia due to predominance of Kapha-provocation, the treatment must be chiefly by bitter, pungent and hot drugs. In tridiscordance condition it should be of the mixed nature.
Treatment in Geophagic Type
117-117½. The skilful physician should expel the ingested earth from the body by strong purificatory measures, after due consideration of the vitality of the patient.
118-120½. And when the body has been purified, strength-promoting ghees should be administered. The person suffering from the morbid effects of gophagism should drink, according to the prescribed procedure, the medicated ghee prepared with the three spices, bael, turmeric and Indian berberry, the three myrobalans, the two varieties of hog’s weed, nut-grass, iron-powder, Patha, embelia, deodar, climbing nettle mercury and beetle killer, along with milk and ghee. Similarly, he may drink the medicated ghee prepared with fragrant poon, liquorice, long pepper, alkali and scutch grass.
121-122½. If the patient is unable to leave off geophagism owing to loss of self-control, in order to make him averse to it, he should be given earth treated with drugs which have also the power to neutralise its bad effects. These drugs are embelia, atees, leaves of neem, Patha, brinjal, kurroa, kurchi seeds and roots of trilobed virgin’s bower.
123-123½. The patient suffering from anemia [pandu-roga] due to geophagism should be treated with medication indicated in anemia, according to the provoked humor. This special mode of treatment is indicated by the special etiological factors.
Treatment according to the stage of disease
124-124½. If the jaundice-patient is seen passing stools of the color of the paste of til (clay color), the physician should know that the Pitta in the body is occluded in its course and he should alleviate this condition by drugs curative of Kapha.
125-125½. The pathogenosis of the above-mentioned condition is as follows: as the result of undue indulgence in dry, cold, heavy and sweet articles of diet and in exercise and suppression of natural urges, the Vata combined with Kapha gets provoked and expels the Pitta from its seat.
126-127½. The patient then develops yellow coloration of the eyes, urine and skin, whitish stools, tympanites and intestinal torpor, and gradually becomes afflicted with heaviness of heart, debility, low digestive power, pain in the sides, hiccup, dyspnea, anorexia and fever on account of the Pitta having suffered diminution and receded to the peripheral system.
128-128½. In such conditions, the physician should give the patient diet mixed with meat-juices of peacock, partridge and cock, seasoned with dry, acid and pungent articles, as also thin gruels prepared with dry radish or horse-gram.
129-129½. The patient may take as potion the juice of pomelo mixed with honey, long pepper and dry ginger, in order to induce the provoked Pitta to return to its normal habitat.
130-130½. Treatment with pungent, strong, hot, saltish and very acid drugs should be persisted in, till the fecal matter acquires the coloration of Pitta and the Vata is alleviated.
131-131½. When the Pitta has returned to its habitat, the fecal matter becomes colored with Pitta and there is subsidence of complications, the line of treatment laid down earlier for jaundice, should be resumed.
132-133½. If in an anemia-patient the physician marks green, black or yellow coloration of skin, together with lowered vitality and spirits, torpor, loss of gastric fire, low fever, insensitiveness to women, body-ache, dyspnea, thirst, anorexia and vertigo, he should recognise it as Halimaka-jaundice resulting from the provocation of Vata and Pitta.
134-135. In this condition, the patient may drink the medicated ghee prepared from buffalo’s ghee with the juice of guduch and milk; when he is oleated sufficiently, he may take turpeth mixed with juice of emblic myrobalan, and on sufficient purgation, he may resort to articles mainly of the sweet taste, which are curative of Pitta and Vata.
136-136½. The patient may use the aforesaid grape linctus, sweet ghees, palliative enemata, compound milk enemata and unctuous enemat. He may drink, in due manner, the medicated wine made from grapes, to promote the gastric fire.
137-137½. According to the morbid humor concerned and the patient’s vitality, he may use the Chebulic Myrobalan Linctus prescribed in the treatment of cough, or long pepper, liquorice and heart-leaved sida mixed with milk.
Summary
Here are the two recapitulatory verses—
138-138½. The causes, symptoms and treatment of the five types of anemia [panduroga], and the two types of jaundice, their curability and incurability.
139. Their variations and the grave type of anemia known as Halimaka, together with its diagnosis and treatment in general, have been described herein.
16. Thus, in the Section on Therapeutics in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the sixteenth chapter entitled ‘The Therapeutics of Anemia [pandu-roga-cikitsa]’ not being available, the game as restored by Dridhabala, is completed.
Etiology and onset
10. Each of these two is described to be of five kinds in the chapter on Eight Abdominal Diseases (Chap. XIX Sūtra). Now listen to a description of their etiology, symptoms and treatment.
11-16. From dust, smoke and wind, from residence in cold climes and use of cold water, from undue exertion or sex-act, from excessive walking and from taking of dry and irregular diet, from chyme-disorders, constipation, dehydration and extreme inanition, from debility and trauma to vital organs, from recourse to mutually antagonistic procedures, from overdoing of purificatory procedures, from diarrhea, fever, vomiting, coryza, wasting due to pectoral lesions, hemothermia; misperistalsis, acute gastro-intestinal irritation, intestinal torpor, anemia and toxicosis, these two diseases take their origin. Also by the habitual use of lablab bean, black gram, til-paste and til-oil, by eating preparations of paste, lotus rhizomes and food that is slowly digested, irritant or heavy, by constant use of the flesh of the aquatic and wet-land animals, curds and raw milk, by liquefacient medications and by indulgence in Kapha-producing articles, by trauma and constriction of various kinds affecting the throat and chest, these two diseases are produced.
17-17½. The Vata, having entered the respiratory channels, becomes irritated and rouses up the Kapha lying in the chest and produces hiccup [hikka] and dyspnea [shvasa], each of which is of five varieties, dreadful and often fatal to life.
18. Now, listen as I describe the premonitory symptoms of both these.
Premonitory Symptoms
19-20. Heaviness in the throat and chest, astringent taste in the mouth as well as distension of the abdomen are the premonitory symptoms of hiccup. Constipation, pleurodynia, sense of compression on the heart, and derangement of the respiratory function are the premonitory symptoms of dyspnea [shvasa].
21. The Vata, combined with Kapha, obstructing the respiratory and deglutitory channels, produces various kinds of hiccup. Now listen to a description of the signstand symptoms of each type.
22-26. In the body of the patient whose flesh, strength, vitality and lustre have wasted away, the Vata, in association with Kapha, laying spasmodic hold of the patient’s throat produces persistent hiccup characterised by loud and strident sound, which manifests in a series of one, two or three at a time in each paroxysm. The Prana-Vata, further smothering the body-channels, vital organs aud the vital fire, deprives the man of his consciousness, causes stiffness of the limbs, obstructs the deglutitory passage and also causes loss of memory; the patient’s eyes are suffused with tears; his temples are rigid and his eye-brows are askew; his speech is spasmodic and delirious, and the patient finds no relief whatever. This hiccup, originating as it does from the vital parts of the body and being exceedingly fulminating, exceedingly strident, and exceedingly powerful, is called the Hiccup Major; it is regarded as immediately destructive of life. Thus has been described ‘The Hiccup Major’ (Terminal Hiccup)
27-30. The person who is aged, emaciated and dispirited, hiccups [hikka] painfully, producing deep resonating sounds from the dilapidated chest. He pendiculates, contracts and extends his limbs, and being, afflicted with rigidity and pain, he presses in both his sides and groans; his hiccup rises either from the umbilical region or from the lower part of the abdomen; his whole body is greatly agitated and flexed; he feels choked as the result of obstructions in the respiratory tract; his strength and mind are depressed; this condition is called the Deep Hiccup. This too, is considered fatal. Thus has been described ‘The Deep Hiccup.’
31-33. The hiccup [hikka], which appears on ingestion of food and drink of any of the four types, gains greatly in intensity at the time when the digestion is completed. It is accompanied with delirium, vomiting, diarrhea, thirst and unconsciousness. The patient pendiculates often; his eyes are flowing with tears; his mouth is dry; his body becomes flexed; his abdomen is distended all round. This hiccup originates from the clavicular region of the body and is not continuous. This is called the Cyclical Hiccup. It is also harmful to life. Thus has been described ‘The Cyclical Hiccup.’
34.When a small part of Vata, constrained by violent exercise, is driven up from the alimentary tract into the throat, it gives rise to the hiccup [hikka] called Hiccup Minor.
35. This variety of hiccup [hikka] is not very painful, nor does it afflict much the vital centres in the chest and head; nor does it obstruct the respiratory and deglutitory passages.
36-37. This condition is aggravated by exertion and abates immediately on the ingestion of food. It disappears as abruptly as it comes into appearance. Affecting the heart, the Kloman, the throat and the palate, this mild variety of hiccup in men, known as the Minor, is said to be curable. Thus has been described ‘The Hiccup Minor’.
38-41. By the ingestion of food aud drink in great haste or in excessive quantities or by consuming highly intoxicating drinks, the Vata, getting compressed, travels upwards from the alimentary tract. So too, by inordinate indulgence in anger, talk, wayfaring, laughing and load-carrying, the Vata which is normally located in the alimentary tract, getting compressed by the ingested food and drink, goes wandering hither and thither in the body. In such conditions, it enters the passages in the chest and gives rise to the hiccup [hikka] which makes its appearance on ingestion of meals. When under the attack, the patient hiccups at long and uneven intervals and even while sneezing. This variety of hiccup does not cause affliction to the vital centres nor does it afflict the sense-organs. It subsides on ingestion of food and drink. This is the alimental hiccup induced by ingestion of food. Thus has been described ‘The Alimental Hiccup.’
The Twin Hiccup [hikka]
42-43. The hiccup that occurs in persons suffering from excessive accumulation of morbidity or from emaciation resulting from abstinence or in persons with bodies that have been wasted away by disease or in persons who are aged or given to inordinate indulgence in sex, soon takes away the life of its victim. When the curable varieties of hiccup [hikka] mentioned above are seen to occur in paroxysms of two hiccups at a time, this is called the ‘Twin Hiccup’ and is marked by delirium, distress, thirst and fainting.
44. This variety of hiccup [hikka] occurring in a patient who is neither wasted in body, nor run-down, but has his body-elements and sense-organs in a sound condition, is curable. Under other circumstances, it terminates fatally.
Dyspnea Major
45. If Vata, in association with Kapha, obstructing the respiratory passages, gets itself obstructed and spreads in all directions, it causes disorders of respiration.
46-48. The person, in whom the expiratory movement of Vata is aroused, is greatly afflicted and being obstructed in his respiration, breathes incessantly with a loud and long stertor like an intoxicated bull. He loses all sense of knowledge and understanding; his eyes are restless; his face gets distorted, his urine and feces get constipated; his voice is weakened; he gets into a moribund state; and his intensely hurried breathing is noticeable even from a distance. A person afflicted with this greatest of disorders of breathing will indeed succumb to it soon. Thus has deen described ‘Dyspnea Major (Terminal Dyspnea)’.
Expiratory Dyspnea
49-51. That condition is known as expiratory dyspnea where the expiratory phase is prolonged while the inspiratory process is insignificant. The mouth and respiratory tract are obstructed by mucus; the patient is greatly afflicted with his provoked Vata; his eyes are turned upwards, he is oblivious to his surroundings (coma vigil) and his gaze is restless, moving hither and thither. Afflicted with pain, he passes into a stupor; his mouth is parched and he is listless and in great distress. His expiratory process, being excessively provoked and the inspiratory process being obstructed, the patient suffers from dilution and fainting This condition of expiratory dyspnea soon takes away the patient’s life. Thus has been described ‘The Expiratory Dyspnea’.
Cheyne-Stoke’s Respiration
52-54. In that condition, the patient, being afflicted in all his vital breaths, breathes with interruptions or ceases to breathe altogether (apnea) and is in great distress and afflicted with pain as if his vital parts had been sundered. He is afflicted with constipation, sweat and fainting, burning and retention of urine; his eyes are filled with tears; he is greatly emaciated; while struggling for breath his eyes become excessively injected; he is unconscious; his mouth is dry; he is cyanosed; he becomes delirious; a man who is thus broken down with interrupted breathing (Cheyne-Stoke’s Respiration) soon abandons his life. Thus has been described ‘The interrupted respiratory dyspnea (Cheyne-Stoke’s Respiration).’
Bronchial asthma
55-62. If the Vata, becoming reversed in its course, reaches the respiratory tract, lays hold of the neck and the head and rouses up the Kapha, then it causes coryza- Obstructed by this coryza there is produced a variety of dyspnea [shvasa] associated with a wheezing sound and characterized by acute condition and causing great affliction to the vital breath. On account of the force of the paroxysm the patient faints, coughs and becomes motionless. While thus constantly coughing, he feels faint frequently. Owing to inability to expectorate, he feels greatly distressed and on the sputum being expectorated, he feels comfort for a while. His throat is afflicted and he can hardly speak; and embarrassed by dyspnea he is not able to get sleep while lying flat in his bed, because the Vata presses upon both his sides while he is in bed. He finds comfort in a sitting posture (orthopnea) and he likes only hot things. His eyes are wide open; his forehead is covered with sweat; he is in great distress all the time; his mouth is dry; he breathes easily once and again his respiration becomes violent. These proxysms are intensified by cloudy, humid and cold weather and an easterly wind, as well as by Kapha-increasing things. This bronchial asthma is palliable. It is curable if it be of recent origin. Thus has been described ‘(Tamaka-śvāsa) Bronchial Asthma.’
63-64. That should be known as Pratamaka or febrile dyspnea [shvasa] which appears in a patient overcome with fever and fainting. That which is excited by misperistalsis, inhalation of dust, indigestion, old age or debilitated condition or the suppression of natural urges, which is greatly aggravated during night and which is alleviated by cold medications and in which the patient feels as if he is submerged in a sea of darkness, is to be known as Santamaka or cardiac asthma, Thus have been described ‘The Febrile Dyspnea and Cardiac Asthma.’
Dyspnea Minor
65-67½. Owing to the use of un-unctuous things or to exertion, there takes place a minor disturbance of Vata in the alimentary tract, which causes dyspnea minor. This minor dyspnea does not afflict the body with great pain; it does not hurt the limbs, and is not so formidable as the other types of dyspnea [shvasa]. It does not interfere with the normal course of food and drink, or afflict the sense-organs, or cause painful conditions. This condition is regarded as curable. All the other conditions too, where the symptoms are not fully manifest and occur in strong people, are similarly curable. Thus the different varieties of dyspnea and hiccup [hikka], together with their different symptoms, have been described.
68-69. From among these, those that are fatal should not be accepted for treatment for they are indeed serious and fulminating. As regards those which are curable or palliable, the physician should take them in hand immediately. If they are neglected they will consume the patient as fire consumes dry grass
70. In view of the fact that the pathogenetic factors, habitat and humoral morbidity being the same in both the diseases (hiccup and dyspnea), the treatment too follows the same lines. Now learn from me the line of treatment as laid down by the sages.
Line of Treatment
71. The patient afflicted with hiccup [hikka] and dyspnea [shvasa] should be first anointed with salted oils and then subjected to unctuous sudation by methods of steamkettle sudation, hot-bed sudation and mixed sudation.
72. By these procedures, the Kapha which has become inspissated in the patient’s body, gets dissolved in the body passages; the body-outlets become softened and as a result, the movement of Vata is restored to normal condition.
73. Just as the snow lying in mountain-bushes thaws, warmed by the rays of the sun, in the same manner, the congealed Kapha in the body melts when subjected to the sudation therapy.
74. When the patient is ascertained to have sweated to the proper degree, he should be immediately given to eat a dish of unctuous rice supplemented by the soup either of fish or pork and the supernatant part of curds,
75. When as the result of this diet, the Kapha is increased in the patient, he should be administered an emetic, compounded of long pepper, rock-salt and honey, after ascertainment that such an emetic is not antagonistic to Vata.
76. When the vitiated and stagnant Kapha has thus been expelled from the system, the patient attains ease and the body-channels being purified, the Vata moves through the channels unimpeded.
77-78 If at the end of the above treatment there is found a residue of morbidity still lodged in the body, the wise physician should endeavour to remove it by means of the inhalation therapy. Thus cigars should be made of the paste of turmeric, cassia, cinnamon, the roots of the castor plant, lac, red arsenic, deodar, yellow orpiment and nardus; these cigars should be smeared with ghee and smoked; also the patient may inhale the fumes of barley-paste mixed with ghee.
79-80. Or, the patient may inhale the fumes of bee’s wax, sal resin and ghee by burning them in a couple of earthen vessels placed one above the other, the upper being provided with holes for the escape of the fumes. Or, the patient may inhale the fumes of the horns, the hairs or sinews of a cow, or of Indian calosanthes, castor plant, wild potherbs, dry reeds of small sacrificial grass, Himalayan cherry, or gum guggul, eagle wood or Indian olibanum, soaked in ghee.
81. The dyspnea [shvasa] and cough, appearing as sequele of laryngeal affection, diarrhea, hemothermia aud burning should be treated by means of therapeutic agents which are sweet, unctuous, refrigerant etc.
82. The following type of dyspnea and hiccup [hikka] patients should not be subjected to sudation-therapy. Those afflicted with Pitta and burning, those evincing hemorrhagic tendency and hyperhidrosis, those who have suffered loss of body-elements and strength, those who are dehydrated, the gravida and those who are of the Pitta-habitus
83. If sudation therapy be found desirable, they should be made to sweat only for a short while by the use of lukewarm, unctuous affusion or by mild Utkarika poultices mixed with sugar, applied preferably to the neck and chest.
84. The poultice which is made of the powder of til seeds, linseeds, blackgram and wheat, mixed with unctuous substances that are alleviative of Vata and combined with acid articles or with cow’s milk is recommended.
Treatment according to stage
85. In cases of recent fever and chyme-disorders, the physician should prescribe dry sudation in conjunction with fasting or he may, after careful examination, administer emesis by means of saline water.
86. The physician, if he finds that the Vata has become exacerbated by the over-action of the purificatory procedures should bring it under control, by the administration of meat-juices etc., which are alleviative of Vata and by means of inunctions which are neither too hot nor too cold.
87. In disorders of misperistalsis and abdominal distension, a diet containing pomelo, common sorrel, asafoetida, tooth brush tree and vid salt, brings about the rectification of the peristaltic movement of Vata.
88. Among the patients suffering from hiccup and dyspnea [shvasa], some are of strong constitution and others are of weak constitution; some again, show a preponderance of Kapha and others are marked by dryness and excess of Vata.
89. As regards patients who are characterised by the excess of Kapha, as also those who are of strong constitution, emesis in conjunction with purgation, should be carried out. After the patient has been put on the proper diet, sedation-therapy by means of inhalation and linctuses, should be given.
90. Those who evince an excess of Vata or are of weak constitution, or those who are young or aged should only be impleted by means of sedative unctuous articles, soups, meat-juices etc., which are curative of Vata.
91.If the purificatory procedures are administered to those whose Kapha has not been relaxed, the Vata, gaining ground, will dry up the vital parts, aud take away the life of the patient.
92. Therefore, the patients with strong constitution and those with an excess of Kapha, should first be impleted by means of meat-juices of wet-land and aquatice [aquatic?] animals and then sweated before they are administered the purificatory measures. The other kinds of patients (those of weak constitution and with an excess of Vāta) should be given impletion-therapy straightway by the physician.
93. For this purpose, the fleshes of peacock, partridge, cock and birds and animals of the Jangala type, prepared with the decoction of the decaradices or with the soup of horse-gram are beneficial.
Dietetic Recipes
94-95. Take a quantity of Indian night-shade, the pulp of bael fruit, gall, Cretan prickly clover, small caltrops, guduch, horse-gram and white flowered leadwort; cook these in water. The decoction, when filtered, should be seasoned with ghee and long pepper. Taken with the addition of the powder of dry ginger and salt, this soup makes a good article of diet.
96. Take a quantity of Indian groundsel, heart leaved sida, minor pentaradices, green gram and white-flowered leadwort, and having cooked them in water, prepare as before, a soup out of the decoction thus obtained.
97-98. Take the tender shoots of pomelo, neem and of the carilia fruit and boil these together with green gram and the three spices and prepare an alkaline soup. A soup skilfully prepared by means of barley-alkali, drumstick and black pepper makes a good remedy for the disorders of hiccup [hikka] and dyspnea [shvasa].
99. The soup made from the leaves of negro coffee and of drumstick as also the soup prepared from dry radish are curative of hiccup and dyspnea.
100. The soup made of brinjals mixed with curds, the three spices and ghee is beneficial in conditions of hiccup and dyspnea, as also a boiled dish of old Shali or Shashtika rice or wheat or barley.
101. The thin gruel prepared with asafoetida, sanchal salt, cumin seeds, vid salt, orris root, white-flowered leadwort and galls is good for patients suffering from hiccup [hikka] and dyspnea.
102-103.

104. To the diet of these patients should be added either as drink or as food, the following articles:—orris root, long zedoary, the three spices, pomelo and common sorrel, seasoned with ghee, vid salt and asafoetida.
105. The dyspnea or hiccup [hikka] patient should drink for the relief of thirst, the decoction either of decaradices, or of deodar, or Madira wine.
106. Taking trilobed virgins bower, Indian groundsel, long-leaved pine and deodar and having washed and ground them into bits, the physician should drop these into a vessel containing the supernatant part of Sura wine.
107. Salting it slightly, he should cause the patient to drink the potion in the dose of 8 tolas. This potion relieves hiccup as well as dyspnea [shvasa].
108. The patient may drink asafoetida, sanchal salt, jujube, sensitive plant, long pepper and heart-leaved sida, reduced to paste in the juice of pomelo or mixed with sour conjee.
109. The paste of sanchal salt, dry ginger and bettle killer mixed with double the measure of sugar should be taken as potion in hot water. This is curative of hiccup and dyspnea.
110. One may drink with water the paste of bettie killer and dry ginger, or the paste of black pepper, and barley-alkali, or the paste of Indian berberry, white-flowered leadwort, Indian sarsaparilla and trilobed virgin’s bower.
111. In dyspnea, resulting from complications of Pitta, one may take small wheat, bamboo manna, dry ginger and long pepper made into Utka-rika pancakes and cooked in ghee.
112. In dyspnea occurring as a complication of Vata-discordance, one may take the flesh of the porcupine and the rabbit and the blood of the pangolin, each cooked with ghee and long pepper.
113. In dyspnea occurring as a sequela of Vata and Pitta, the juice of the leaves of the heliotrope, cow’s milk and ghee, seasoned with the three spices is a beneficial beverage, following a dish of boiled Shali rice

115. Liquorice, the roots of long pepper, gur, the juice of the dung of cow or horse, ghee and honey are good for those affected with cough, hiccup and dyspnea and with profuse expectoration.
116. In affections of hiccup and dyspnea marked by an excess of Kapha, the patient should drink along with honey, the juice of any of the dungs of ass, horse, camel, boar, ram and elephant.
116½. The patient may lick the alkali of winter-cherry with honey and ghee.
117-120. He will get over severe attacks of hiccup and dyspnea by licking mixed with ghee and honey, the powder consisting of the ashes of the talons and quills of the peacock or the quills of the pangolin, or the bristles of the porcupine, the armadillo, the blue jay, or of osprey and the horns of the single hoofed or cloven hoofed animals, as also their skins, bones and hoofs. These ailments of Kapha, hiccup and dyspnea arise as the result of provocation of the life-breaths whose course has been obstructed by the accumulation of Kapha; therefore it is only with a view to clearing the respiratory passages of morbid Kapha that the linctuses mentioned above should be given and not in conditions where there is no morbidity of Kapha.
121. The intelligent physician should give emesis medicated with drugs alleviative of Vata and Kapha to patients suffering from cough and cracked voice (hoarseness); and to asthmatics, he should give purgation medicated with drugs alleviative of Vata and Kapha.
122. Just as the flowing waters of a stream, when dammed in their course, swell up and press on all sides, so does the constantly moving Vata behave. Hence its passage should ever be kept clear.
123-124. Take equal quantities of long zedoary, angelica, cork swallow wort, cinnamon-bark, nutgrass, orris root, holy basil, feather foil, long pepper, eagle-wood, dry ginger and fragrant sticky mallow and reducing all these to powder, mix with eight times the total quantity of sugar. This powder may be used in all therapeutic modes in asthma and hiccup [hikka].
125-127. Pearl, coral, cat's eye beryl, conch, crystal, antimony, motley gem, sulphur, glass, mudar, small cardamom, rock salt and sanchal salt, powders of iron, copper and silver, sulphur, lead, nutmeg, seeds of flaxhemp and seeds of rough chaff; the compound powder of these, licked in the dosage of 1 tola mixed with an equal quantity of honey and ghee, is curative of hiccup, dyspnea [shvasa] and cough.
128.If used as collyrium, it cures Timira, Kaca, Nilika, Pushpaka, Tama, Malya, Kandu, Abhishyanda and Arma. Thus has been described ‘The compound Pearl Powder.’

134. Milk mixed with sugar and honey should be given as potion and nasal errhine to the hiccup-patient; it should be administered hot and cold alternately.
135. The medicated ghee prepared with purgative drugs soon cures hiccup; the juice of emblic myrobalan or of wood-apple mixed with long pepper and honey, acts similarly.
136. The patient with hiccup [hikka] should take as linctus roasted paddy, lac, honey, grapes and long pepper, with the juice of the horse-dung or the linctus of jujube, honey, grapes, long pepper and dry ginger.
137. Subjecting the patient to sudden affusions of cold water, to intimidation, distraction and fright, or rousing him to anger, pleasure, love or anxiety, is said to avert an attack of hiccup.
138. Whatever has been laid down as being causative of hiccup [hikka] and dyspnea [shvasa] should be eschewed by subjects of hiccup and dyspnea who desire to keep themselves in health.
139. Those who suffer from the complications of hiccup [hikka] and dyspnea [shvasa], whose chest, throat and palate have been rendered dry, and who are by nature dry, should be treated with ghee.
Medicated Ghees
140-140½. The medicated ghee prepared with the decoction of decaradices, ghee and the supernatant fluid of curds and with the paste of long pepper, sanchal salt, alkali, emblic myrobalans, asafoetida, angelica and chebulic myrobalans, is curative of hiccup and dyspnea.

General theory of Treatment
147. Whatever drug, food or drink is alleviative of Kapha and Vata, and is heat-giving and regulative of the movements of Vata, is beneficial for patients afflicted with hiccup [hikka] and dyspnea.
148. One should not use exclusively drugs that belong to either of the two groups viz., those which alleviate Kapha but aggravate Vata; and those which alleviate Vata but aggravate Kapha. If one has to choose between the two, the drugs alleviative of Vata are to be preferred,
149. The undesirable side-effects of treatment by roborant drugs are, in all cases, slight and for the most part, easily corrected. As regards treatment by sedative drugs, there is not great risk; while in that by depletive drugs, the ill-effects are many aud intractable.
150. Therefore, persons suffering from hiccup [hikka] and dyspnea should, as a rule, be treated with drugs that are sedative and roborant, whether these persons have undergone preliminary purificatory procedures or not.
Summary
Here is the recapitulatory verse—
151. The formidable nature, reasons explaining the commonness in the manifestation and treatment of both hiccup and dyspnea, the signs and symptoms of these disorders, and the dietetic rules to be observed, have all been set forth in this chapter.
17. Thus, in the Section on Therapeutics in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the seventeenth chapter entitled ‘The Therapeutics of Hiccup and Dyspnea [hikka-shvasa-cikitsa]’ not being available, the same as restored by Dridhabala, is completed.
Varieties
4. The three kinds of cough each due to each of the humors—Vata, Pitta and Kapha, one due to pectoral lesions and another to loss of body-elements; these are the five types of cough disorder [kasa]. If they are allowed to progress, they give rise to consumption.
5. The premonitory symptoms of all these types of disorders are—the feeling as if the throat and mouth are all covered with bristles, itching in the throat and difficulty in ingestion.
Pathology and Etiology
6-8. The Vata, getting obstructed in the lower channels, becomes lodged in the upper channels and taking on the function of the Udana Vata, i.e. expiratory function, gets localised in the throat and the chest. Then entering all the cavities in the head, fills them up and causes hunching and convulsive movements of the body, jaws, sides of the neck and eyes. It distorts and stiffens the eyes, back, chest and sides of the body and then leads to cough which is either dry or accompanied with expectoration of phlegm. ‘Cough’ is so called because the word ‘Cough’ (Kāsa [kāsa]) is derived from the root ‘kas’ to move. It caused the movement of phlegm from the respiratory passages
9. The characteristic sound and pain of cough is produced as a result particularly of the obstruction to the forceful movement of the Vata.
10. Dry, cold, astringent, scanty and measured diet, indulgence in women, suppression of natural urges and overstrain are the causative factors of the Vata type of cough disorder [kasa].
Symptoms
11-13. Its symptoms are—pain in the cardiac region, sides, chest and head; great alteration in voice: dryness of chest, throat and mouth; horripilation, faintness, rattling sound in the throat, depression of spirits, hollow sound of cough, weakness agitation and stupor. The cough [kasa] is dry and the patient expectorates, with great difficulty cry sputum and after expectoration, the cough is diminished. It is alleviated by unctuous, acid, salt and hot foods and drinks. This variety of cough, which is caused by the provocation of the expiratory movement of Vata, is aggravated at the time of the completion of digestion.
Pitta type
14. Excessive indulgence in the use of pungent, hot, irritant, acid and alkaline articles; anger and heat of fire and sun are the causative factors of the Pitta-type of cough-disorder [kasa].
15-16. There is yellow expectoration, icteric tinge of the eyes, bitter taste in the mouth, disorder of voice, sensation of fuming in the chest, thirst, burning, stupor, anorexia and giddiness; and due to prolonged coughing, the patient is so dazed that he feels he perceives the stars; he expectorates sputum mixed with bile. These are the symptoms of the Pitta type of cough-disorder.
Kapha-Type
17. The Kapha, increased by the use of heavy, liquefacient, sweet and unctuous articles, and by day-sleep and habitual inactivity, obstructs the course of Vata and produces the cough disorder [kasa] of the Kapha type.
18-19. its symptoms are—weakness of the gastric fire, anorexia, vomiting, coryza, nausea, heaviness, horripilation, sweet taste in the mouth, increased secretions and asthenia The patient expectorates dense, sweet, sticky and thick sputum. While coughing he does not feel much pain and he feels as though his chest is over-full.
Cough [kasa] due to Pectoral Lesions
20. The Vata, getting lodged in the pectoral lesions of the person who is dehydrated as the result of excessive sex-indulgence, load-carrying, way-faring, wrestling and restraining horses and elephants, will lead to cough-disorder [kasa].
21-23. The patient has a dry cough in the beginning; later on, he expectorates blood. He gets severe pain in the throat; he feels acute pain in the chest: he feels severe shooting and pricking pain as though pierced by sharp needles; there is tenderness to touch in the part; he is afflicted with great stabbing and lancinating pains; he is affected with arthralgia, fever, dyspnea, thirst, cacophonia and during the paroxysm of cough, he coos like a pigeon. These are the symptoms of cough due to pectoral lesions.
Cough due to wasting
24-24½. The gastric fire being vitiated in squeamish or mournful persons as the result of unbalanced or unwholesome diet, excessive sexual indulgence and suppression of natural urges, the three humors become provoked and produce the cough, born of wasting, which in turn leads to the consumption of the body.
25-29. Its symptoms are—the patient expectorates offensive, greenish, sanguineus or purulent sputum. During the fit of coughing, he feels as though his heart were displaced, he becomes affected with cold or heat without any apparent cause: he eats in excess but is weak and emaciated; his complexion and skin are glossy and clear. There is a glow in his looks and eyes; his palms and soles are smooth; he is always carping and squeamish; he suffers from a mixed type of fever, from pain in the sides of the chest, coryza and anorexia; he passes irregularly unformed or formed feces and suffers from alteration of voice without any apparent cause. Such is the cough disorder [kasa] born of wasting. When occurring in an emaciated person, it causes death. It is curable in strong persons; it is only palliable if it arises from pectoral lesions.
30. The last two kinds of cough are sometimes curable if the four basic factors of treatment are fully available. All kinds of senile cough [kasa] occurring in old persons are regarded as palliable.
31. Thus, the physician should aim at a radical cure in the case of the three curable varieties of cough described at the outset; in the case of the other varieties admitting only of a palliative treatment, he should administer wholesome palliative remedies. Now listen to a general description of therapeutic measures curative of cough.
Treatment
32-34. The intelligent physician should treat the cough due to Vata occurring in a dehydrated person by the skilful application of general oleation measures consisting of potions of ghee, unctuous enemata, gruels, soups, milk, meat-juices etc, medicated with drugs curative of Vata, as also of unctuous foods, smokes, electuaries, inunctions, unctuous baths and sudations. If the patient suffers from obstructed feces and flatus, he should be treated by means of enemata; if the upper part of his body is dehydrated, he should be given postprandial potions; if he suffers from cough associated with Pitta, he should be treated by medicated ghees and if the cough [kasa] is associated with Kapha, the treatment should include unctuous purgations.

Summary
Here is the recapitulatory verse—
191. The number of the varieties of cough [kasa] , their causation, the signs and symptoms, their curability and incurability, their various remedies and their comparative gravity—all this has been set out in this chapter.
18. Thus, in the Section on Therapeutics, in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the eighteenth chapter entitled ‘The Therapeutics of Cough-disorders [kasa-cikitsa]’, not being available, the same as restored by Dridhabala, is completed.
Tridiscordance Type
8. By taking very cold, unctuous, dry, hot, heavy, rough, hard, irregular, antagonistic and non-homologatory articles of diet, by abstinence from diet, or by late meals, by eating whatever comes in hand, by drinking vitiated wine or beverage, by excessive indulgence in wine, by lack of seasonal purification, by the wrongful effects of therapeusis or by lack of therapeusis or excessive exposure to fire, sun, wind and water, by lack of sleep or by excessive sleep, by suppression of the natural urges, by abnormality of season, by exertions beyond ones capacity, by excess of fear, grief and mental anxiety, and by excessive emaciation due to helminthiasis, consumption, fever and piles—by these factors, the gastric fire gets affected, as a consequence of which all the three humors get provoked and impair the vital heat still further; and entering the colon, produces diarrhea manifesting the combined symptoms of all the above-described varieties of diarrhea [atisara].
The formidable type
9-(1). Further, the morbid humors excessively vitiate the blood and other body-elements and manifest in the stools various colors characteristic of the body-elements which are vitiated.
9-(2). If the blood and other bodyelements are excessively vitiated, the stools are yellow, green, blue, coffee-brown, of the color of flesh-washed water, red, black, white or of the color of hog’s fat; the patient passes stools with much pain or slight pain. The above colors are seen individually or combined. The patient passes indeterminately hard and undigested stools or even digested stools. He may not suffer from great loss of flesh, blood or vitality, his gastric fire gets dull; he suffers loss of taste in the mouth. Such a case is to be known as of a formidable type.
Incurable type
9-(3). If the patient who passes stools of the colors described below develops complications. He should be pronounced to be incurable and sent away.
9. They are of the color of the digested blood (melena or tar-colored stools) or like the bits of liver tissue; of the appearance of the washings of fat and flesh, of the likeness of curds, ghee, marrow, fat, milk and minted meat Excessively blue-red, dark, limpid like water, of the color of tar, excessively unctuous, green, blue or brown in color, variegated, dirty, slimy, containing fibrinous shreds, undigested, refracting-various colors attended with offensive and putrid smell as of putrified flesh or of raw fish, attracting flies, containing sloughs and discharge of body-tissues and very little or no fecal matter, very frequent stools complicated by thirst, burning, fever, giddiness, asthma, hiccup and dyspnea; attended with acute or mild pain and prolapse or inflammation of the rectum, drooping of rectal folds, aud prolapse of the rectal tube with exces give loss of vitality, flesh and blood, pain in all the bones and joints, anorexia, apathy, delirium and delusion, and characterised by sudden cessation of symptoms; know such a patient with these symptoms to be incurable. Thus has been described ‘The Diarrhea due to Tridiscordance.’
10. Before it passes into the incurable stage, the physician, by investigating the etiological factors, homologatory signs and the morbidity of humors, should begin the treatment of the most predominant morbid humor in the condition.
Psychic Factors in Diarrhea [atisara]
11. The exogenous type of diarrhea born of psychic factors, is of two kinds. One is born of fright and the other of grief. The signs and symptoms of both of them are the same as those of the diarrhea  due to Vata.
12. The Vata gets quickly provoked by fear and grief. The treatment is of the Vata-curative type along with inducing cheerfulness and comfort.
13. Thus have been described the six varieties of diarrhea [atisara]. I shall now describe the treatment of the curable conditions in due order. Listen with diligence.
Treatment
14. The patient in whom all the morbid humors are aggravated by the undigested food accumulated in the intestines and cause diarrhea [atisara], must be purged again in order to expel all the morbid matter.
15- 16. No astringent treatment should be given in the first stages of diarrhea when undigested stools are passed If this morbid matter is retained in the body it produces many disorders such as body-stiffness due to intestinal torpor, distension of the abdomen, assimilation-disorder, piles, edema, anemia, splenic disorders, dermatosis, Gulma, abdominal diseases and fever.
17. Hence, the physician must allow the morbid matter to get expelled spontaneously. If it does not flow down easily, the patient may be given chebulic myrobalan which has a purgative action.
18. The morbid matter thus discharged sedates the abdominal condition. The body becomes lighter and the gastric fire increases.
19. If the morbid humors are of moderate intensity, the patient may be given the decoction of digestive stimulants and if the morbid humor is of very slight intensity, lightening therapy is recommended.
20-21. Long pepper, dry ginger, coriander, bishop’s weed, chebulic myrobalan and sweet flag; (2) black cuscus, large variety of nut-grass, bael, dry ginger and coriander; (3) painted leaved ticktrefoil, small caltrops, madder and Indian night-shade; these three groups are described, one in each hemistich, for patients suffering from diarrhea [atisara].
22. Or, the physician may give as potion the water boiled with sweet flag and Indian atees or with nut-grass and trailing rungia or with black cuscus and dry ginger.
23. The physician should feed the patient who is emaciated by hunger with light diet at each meal-time. In this way the patient soon regains appetite, the strength of the gastric fire and vitality.
24. At first, he should be treated with butter-milk, sour conjee, gruel, demulcent drink or with Sura wine or honey, according to his homologation.
25. Thereafter, his dietetic regimen should consist of thin gruel, thick gruel and vegetable soups, pulse, and rice mixed with meat-juices and the drugs stimulative of the gastric fire and astringent in action.
26-29. Ticktrefoil, painted leaved uraria, yellow-berried night-shade, Indian night shade, heart-leaved sida, small caltrops, bael, Patha, dry ginger, coriander, long zedoary, palas, common juniper, sweet flag, cumin seeds, long pepper, bishop’s weed, the roots of long pepper, white-flowered leadwort, elephant pepper, kokum butter, sour pomegranate, asafoetida, bid salt and rock salt; the physician should use the above-mentioned articles methodically prepared in the patient’s food and drink. This group of articles is curative of Vata and Kapha, digestive stimulant, digestive-astringent, and promotive of strength and appetite. Hence, it is recommended for the patients suffering from diarrhea [atisara].
30-33. If the patient, even when his chyme is ripened, still passes his stools excessively formed and in scybalous masses accompanied with colic and mucus or scantily or passes the stools very often, accompanied with griping pain, the physician should feed him with soups of radish and jujube or with curries prepared of Indian spinach, asthma weed, bishop’s weed, white goose foot, sun flower, changchu, babchi seeds, long zedoary, cork swallow wort, sweet cucumber, Patha or also with dried vegetables, prepared with curds and pomegranate aud mixed profusely with unctuous article.
34. The vegetable-soup prepared with equal quantity of the paste of tender bael and til paste mixed with supernatant part of curds, acid substances, and unctuous article, cures dysentery.
Treatment in Acoprosis
35-36. Prepare a cereal-soup of barley, green gram, black gram, Shali rice, til, jujube and tender bael fruits; season it with oil and ghee mixed together and add to it the supernatant part of curds and the juice of pomegranate. The physician should feed the patient afflicted with scanty formation of stools and dryness of mouth, with the cooked Shali rice mixed with the above-mentioned soup.
37-38. Or, he may give as sauce, the supernatant part of curds seasoned with oil and ghee and mixed with gur and dry ginger, or Sura wine seasoned with oil and ghee or the fruit-acids seasoned with oil and ghee or the soup of carrot similarly seasoned, or the sour meat-juice of the fox or the unctuous and sour meat-juice of tortoise may be given.
39 Or, the meat juices of the peacock, partridge, cock and quail and cooked Shali rice mixed with unctuous and sour articles are the best remedies in pain due to acoprosis.
40. Filter the meat-juice of the flesh from goat’s trunk as also its blood; mix them both and prepare with coriander, unctuous article and dry ginger, and acidify by adding the juice of pomegranate.
41. The patient should eat cooked red Shali rice with this meat-juice and also take it as potion. By this he will be relieved of the afflictions caused by acoprosis (decrease of feces).
42. In conditions of the prolapse of rectum and colic, the potion of acidified ghee is recommended, or unctuous enemata, if the patients are free from cyhme-disorders.
43. The patient should drink ghee boiled and mixed with yellow woodsorrel, jujube, sour curds, acid article, dry ginger and alkali, for the cure of the pain due to anal prolapse. Thus has been described ‘The Yellow Wood-sorrel Ghee’.

46. When the anal prolapse is irreducible, the oleation and sudation procedures should be first administered; when the anus is well sweated and softened, it should be reduced with the help of a thick cloth and pushed in.
Treatment according to stage
47. The patient afflicted with retention of flatus and feces, who painfully passes liquid motions mixed with blood and mucus, and who is afflicted with thirst, should be given a full diet of milk.
48. Or, the patient may drink udder warm milk after taking a mixture of oil and ghee; or he may drink milk boiled with tender bael.
49.By the administration of milk in this way, the blood and mucus get cured; colic, diarrhea and constipation too get relieved.
50-(1). The physician diagnosing the diarrhea [atisara] attended with mucus to be of the Pitta type by its etiology, homologation and signs and symtoms, should treat the condition according to its intensity, administering to the patient lightening and digestive therapies.
50-(2). When afflicted with thirst, the patient should be given water boiled with nut-grass, trailing rungia, black cuscus, Indian sarsaparilla, sandal, chiretta and fragrant sticky mallow.

Each of these is described in a hemistich These should be taken as potion mixed with honey and rice-water.
56. When the dose has been digested, a meal of old red Shali rice and meat-juices prepared methodically with astringent drugs are beneficial.
57. The diarrhea [atisara] of the Pitta type is soon cured, if the patients gastric fire is in a strong condition, by the administration of the course of goat’s milk; and his vitality and complexion also get enhanced.

59. The patient should be given as potion the decoction of the seeds of palas mixed with milk, followed by an after-potion of genially warm milk according to his strength.
60. Thus, by means of this mediation when the morbid matter in his bowel gets flushed out, the abdominal trouble gets relieved Zalil should be used in the same manner as a purificatory agent.
61. While being subject to rehabilitatory procedure, if the patient suffers from colic, he should be given purgation followed quickly by unctuous enema in systematic manner.
62. The unctuous enema should be of ghee mixed with 1/4 its quantity of oil and prepared with the paste of dill seed, climbing asparagus, liquorice and bael
63.If even after the administration of the unctuous enema and of the rehabilitative regimen, diarrhea [atisara] still persists, then the mucilaginous enema should be given.
64-67. Envelope the green leafstalks of silk-cotton tree with green sacrificial grass and plaster it with black earth, and steam-boil it in the cow-dung fire, till the earth gets dried up. Take out the leaf-stalks of silk cotton and crush them in boiled milk and pound them in a mortar and make into boluses of 4 tolas each. The bolus should be mixed with 64 tolas of oil and ghee and filtered and added with the paste of liquorice, this unctuous enema should be given to the patient previously inuncted. After the enema has returned, the patient should take his bath and then eat his meal mixed with milk or with meat-juice of Jangala animals.
68. This purgative as well as corrective enema cures quickly severe types of diarrhea [atisara] of the Pitta type, fever, edema, Gulma, chronic diarrhea, and assimilation-disorders.
Dysentery and its Treatment
69-70. If the patient suffering from Pitta type of diarrhea [atisara] gives up the treatment and indulges in Pitta-provoking eats, and drinks, his Pitta gets greatly provoked and produces dysentery or hemorrhagic-diarrhea, vitiates the blood and produces thirst, colic, burning sensation and serious anal inflammation.
71. In this condition, goat’s cold milk mixed with honey and sugar is recommended as drink and sauce and also for anal douching.
72. The patient should be made to eat cooked red Shali rice with this milk or with meat-juices of the pigeon and other birds, seasoned with ghee and mixed with sugar
73. He may be fed with the nonacidified meat juices of rabbits, birds and animals of the Jangala type which are cooling in action, seasoned with ghee and mixed with sugar.
74. The blood of the deer or of the goat, seasoned with ghee, or the slightly acidified soup of the fruits of silk-cotton tree mixed with sugar, is recommended in the above condition.
75-76. Blue lily, the gum of silk-cotton, madder and lotus anthers should be given mixed with goat’s milk; and when this dose is digested, milk and rice should be given as diet. If the patient is weak, he should be given this potion and should immediately be made to take his food, or he should be given butter with honey and sugar before meals.
77. The person taking the meatjuice of partridge for his diet, or living on a milk diet, recovers within three days from this disease by taking milk-churned ghee with milk.
78. The patient observing milk-diet should get his hemorrhagic diarrhea (dysentery) cured by drinking the paste of climbing asparagus mixed with milk or by drinking ghee prepared with climbing asparagus.
79. Ghee prepared with the paste of kurchi seeds may be taken with the supernatant part of gruel, followed by a potion of thin gruel, for the cure of blood in the stools.
80-81. The ghee prepared with the bark of Indian berberry, kurchi seeds, long pepper, ginger, grapes and kurroa, when taken with the supernatant part of gruel, cures quickly even severe diarrhea caused by tridiscordance.
82. Black earth, liquorice, conch, saffron and rice-water mixed together and taken with honey, act as a good hemostatic.
83. The paste of perfumed cherry taken with honey and rice water, stops quickly the hemorrhage in a person living on a diet of the meat juice of Jangala animals.
84. The paste of black til, mixed with five times its quantity of sugar, and taken with goat’s milk, stops the blood in stools immediately.
85. The man who observes a diet of meat-juice, gets cured of stomachdisorders due to Pitta by taking the decoction of four tolas of kurchi seeds.
86. By taking sandal mixed with sugar, honey and rice-water, the patient gets cured of burning, thirst, urinary disorders and hemorrhage.
87-88. If the anus of the patient gets inflamed by frequent pissing of stools, it should be affused with well-cooked decoction of wild snake-gourd and liquorice or with the deoction of the bark of the pentad of milkexuding trees and liquorice, or with sugar-cane juice or with goat’s or cow’s ghee or milk, mixed with sugar and honey.
89. The anus should be smeared with the paste of the drugs described with reference to affusion, mixed with ghee; or the prolapsed anus may be dusted with the fine powder of those drugs.
90-90½. Or, the prolapsed anus may be dusted with the powder of fulsee flower and lodh in equal quantity. The anus thus dusted does not bleed, the inflammation gets alleviated and the pain relieved
91-92½. If the bleeding still continues even after the above described cool affusions, the anus, groins, waist and thighs should be anointed with ghee and affused. The anus and groins should be affused with a swab soaked in the Compound Sandal Oil or with the Hundred times Washed Ghee.
93-94½. If the patient passes scanty aud frequent stools mixed with blood and accompanied with colic, and if he passes the obstructed flatus with difficulty or does not pass at all, he should be given the mucilaginous enema as described before, or the unctuous enema of ghee medicated with tubers of white lotus.
95-95½. The anus of patients suffering from chronic diarrhea generally gets weak; hence repeated application of unctuous substance should be given to it.
96-96½. The Vata that is excessively agitated gets even more augmented in its own habitat; to subdue its strength when in association with Pitta, enema is the best remedy.
97-97½. For the patient who passes blood with or before or after the stools, the medicated Climbing Asparagus Ghee should be prepared and administered as a linctus.
98-98½ This disorder in a man observing wholesome dietetic regimen, will be cured by fresh-churned butter mixed with half its quantity of sugar and one fourth its quantity of honey.
99-99½. Reduce into paste the buds of banyan, gular fig and holy fig and keep them for a day and night in hot water; prepare ghee with this water.
100-100½. This ghee should be used as linctus, mixed with 1/2 its part of sugar and 1/4 its part of honey and given to one who bleeds from the orifices of the upper or lower region of the body.
101-101½. The person that is debilitated and still makes use of Pitta-provoking articles out of ignorance, soon comes to grief, being afflicted with severe suppuration of the anal region.
Treatment in Kapha Type
102-102½. In diarrhea [atisara] due to Kapha, lightening and digestive therapies are beneficial to begin with. The drugs of the digestive-stimulant group, if used in the early stage of diarrhea, prove beneficial.
103-103½. Even if after the lightening therapy and observance of progressive dietetic regimen, the diarrhea born of Kapha does not abate, it should be treated with articles possessing Kapha-curing properties.
104-106½. (1) Bael, galls, nut-grass, chebulic myrobalan and dry ginger; (2) sweet flag, embelia, bishop’s weed, coriander and deodar; (3) costus, Indian atees, Patha, chaba pepper and kurroa; (4) long pepper, roots of long pepper, white-flowered leadwort and elephant pepper—these four recipes each described in a hemistich should be decocted and used in diarrhea due to Kapha; these are promotive of the metabolic heat and body-strength,
107-108½. Take cumin seeds, long pepper, Patha dry ginger and black pepper one part each and two parts of fulsee flower; give these mixed liberally with the juice of pomelo. Take extract of Indian berberry, Indian atees and kurchi seeds in one part each and fulsee flower in two parts and give as potion, mixed with honey and dry ginger.
109-111½. Take, (1) fulsee flower, dry ginger, bael, lodh and lotus anthers; (2) jambul barb, dry ginger, coriander, Patha, gum of silk cotton, and heart leaved sida; (3) madder, fulsee flower, the pulp of bael, the barks of jambul and mango tree; (4) wood-apple, embelia, dry ginger and black pepper; prepare four vegetable soups of the drugs described above in each hemistich, acidified with yellow-wood sorrel, jujube and buttermilk and adding unctuous article and salt, administer it in diarrhea attended with excess of Kapha.
112-112½. By taking as linctus the pulp of wood-apple mixed with the three spices, honey and sugar, or the powder of box myrtle with honey, the patient gets cured of gastric disorder.
113-113½. By a potion of long pepper with honey or buttermilk mixed with the powder of white flowered leadwort or by eating tender bael, the patient gets cured of gastric disorders
114.Tender bael, gur, oil, long pepper and dry ginger should be taken by a patient as linctus, in obstruction of Vata accompanied with colic and dysentery.
115.He may take his food with the decoction of radish and sauces prepared with the Vata-curative articles and vegetable soups recommended in diarrhea [atisara] due to Vata.
116.Or, he may take sour ghee mentioned before or the Shatpala ghee or old ghee mixed with supernatant part of gruel, according to his strength.
117. In obstruction of Vata and Kapha or in excessive discharge of mucus, in colic, or iu dysentery, the mucilaginous enema should be given.
118. The mucilaginous enema should be given mixed with the paste of long pepper, bael, costus, dill seeds and sweet flag, mixed with salt.
119. When the enema fluid has returned, the wise physician should give unctuous enema of genially warm medicated bael-oil in the evening after the patient has bathed comfortably and has taken his meal.
120. Or, the unctuous enema may be given very often with the oil prepared with the group of drugs-ending with sweet flag; thus treated, the patient suffering from Kapha-cum-Vata disorders, gets relieved.
121. The Vata necessarily gets aroused in its own habitat consequent upon the decrease of Kapha. Thus aroused, it may suddenly cause death; hence the physician should subdue it quickly.
122. The Pitta should be subdued after the Vata, and the Kapha should be subdued after the Pitta, or, that humor should be controlled first which happens to be the most predominant of all the three.
Summary
Here is the recapitulatory verse.
123. The primogenesis, etiology, signs and symptoms, curability or otherwise, and treatment according to the stage of disease in diarrhea [atisara] have been described herein.
19. Thus, in the Section on Therapeutics, in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the nineteenth chapter entitled ‘The Therapeutics of Diarrhea [atisara-cikitsa]’ is completed.
Five varieties
9. There are three kinds of vomiting [chardi] each of which is caused by a single morbid humor; a fourth kind caused by the three morbid humors combined, and a fifth that results from contact with unpleasant sense-objects. Their premonitory symptoms are twisting in the stomach, excessive salivation and disgust for food.
The Vata-type
7-9. In a person extremely emaciated by exercise, acute medications, grief, disease, fear, or starvation, the Vata gets greatly increased in the alimentary tract, agitates the humors and then pushing them upward and putting pressure on the internal viscera, precipitates the humors in the stomach and causes vomiting [chardi]. The patient suffering from vomiting of the Vata type is afflicted with pain in the stomach and hypo-chondriac regions, parching of the mouth, pain in the head and umbilical region, cough, change of voice and pricking pain. Being afflicted with a violent urge for vomiting, he ejects out painfully and with great difficulty a little quantity of frothy, broken [???] dark, thin, and astringent matter, making a great noise while vomiting.
The Pitta-type
10.As a result of taking predigestion-meals, or taking pungent, acid, irritant and hot articles of diet, the Pitta gets precipitated and flowing out with force through the biliary passages, and causing pressure, to these, it spreads upwards in the stomach and gives rise to vomiting [chardi].
11. A person affected with vomiting of the Pitta-type is afflicted with fainting, thirst, parching of the mouth, burning in the head, palate and eyes, faintness and giddiness, accompanied with burning pain, and vomits copious, yellow, hot, greenish, bitter and smoky vomitus.
The Kapha-type
12. As a result of very unctuous, very heavy, raw and irritant articles of diet, or excess of sleep and similar other things, the Kapha gets greatly increased and occluding the chest, head, viscera and all the channels concerned, causes vomiting.
13. The patient affected with vomiting [chardi] of the Kapha-type is afflicted with torpor, sweet taste in the mouth-ptyalism, sense of satiety, somnolence, anorexia and heaviness and vomits sticky, dense, sweet and clear vomitus, accompanied with horripilation and slight pain.
The Tridiscordance-type
14. As a result of constant indulgence in promiscuous diet consisting of all the categories of taste combined together, or as a result of chymedisorders, or of the abnormality in seasons, all the three humors getting simultaneously provoked, produce vomiting of the tridiscordance-type.
15. A person affected with vomiting [chardi] of the tridiscordance-type suffers from colic, misdigestion, anorexia, burning, thirst, dyspnea, faintness and incessant and violent fits of vomiting: and he vomits saltish, acid, blue, dense, hot and reddish matter.
16-17. When the morbid Vata, obstructing the passages of the feces, sweat, urine and body-fluid, proceeds upwards carrying with it the morbid matter accumulated in the emunctories, it causes elimination of the morbid matter from the alimentary tract by inducing vomiting. This vomitus which is fetid and ejected with great force, has the color and smell of feces and urine, and is accompanied with thirst, dyspnea, hiccup and pain. The patient rapidly succumbs to the violence of the fit.
The Psychic Type
18. When a person vomits, as a result of mental disgust occasioned by sense-contact with nauseating, unseemly, unclean, foul-smelling, unholy and gruesome sights, articles of diet or odors, it is known as vomiting induced by contact with hateful things.
19.That is regarded as an incurable case of vomiting [chardi] which occurs in an emaciated person and continues incessantly, which is associated with complications, and which contains blood, pus and glistening matter. The physician should undertake treatment of cases of vomiting which are curable and not of those associated with complications.
20. As all the varieties of vomiting [chardi] are considered to originate from the agitation of the humors in the stomach it is either starvation-therapy that should first be prescribed except in cases of vomiting due to Vata, or purificatory procedure curative of Kapha and Pitta.
Treatment in Vata-type
21 The patient may take the pulvis of chebulic myrobalans with honey or palatable purgatives skilfully combined with wine or milk; this draws down the morbid matter that has been impelled to flow upward.
22. He may also take the emetic dose prepared of the drugs of the Valliphala group; or if the patient is weak the physician may treat him with sedative measures by giving him palatable meat juices, light and dried articles of diet, along with various kinds of drinks.
23. The meat-juice of the partridge, the peacock and the quail, properly prepared, controls vomiting caused
by Vata, as also the soup prepared of jujube, horse gram, coriander, roots of the bael group of drugs, acid articles and barley.
24. If the patient suffering from vomiting [chardi] of the Vata-type is afflicted with palpitation of the heart, he may take ghee with rock-salt or ghee prepared with coriander, dry giuger, curds and pomegranate-juice.
25. Or, he may take a proper measure of ghee mixed with the three spices and the three varieties of salts, or he may take unctuous and palatable foods mixed with meat-juices or with soups acidified with curds and sour pomegranate.
Treatment in Pitta-type
26. The physician should administer the pulvis of turpeth mixed with the juices of grape, white yam or sugar-cane, for laxative action in cases of vomiting of the Pitta-type. But if the Pitta, in an excessively increased condition, is lodged in the seat of Kapha (stomach), it should be eliminated through the mouth by means of sweet emetics.
27. After the patient has been cleansed by the purificatory treatment, he should. be given, at the proper time, the demulcent drink prepared of roasted paddy, honey and sugar, or thin gruel. He may be given cooked
Shali rice with the soup of green gram, or meat-juice of Jangala creatures.
28. Or, the patient may take a linctus of half boiled grain, roasted paddy and barley flour and cooked barley along with its scum, date-pulp, coconut, grapes or jujube, mixed with sugar-candy, honey and long pepper.
29. Or, the patient may take the pulvis of riverine antimony, roasted rice, blue water lily, the pulp of jujube or chebulic myrobalan, mixed with honey; or, he may take the kernel of jujube-stone, antimony, the excreta of flies, roasted paddy, candied sugar, and the grains of long pepper mixed with honey.
30. Or, the patient may drink cool grape juice or the cooled water prepared with baked clay or earth, or he may drink the cooled decoction of the sprouts of jambul or mango, mixed with honey.
31. Or, he may take water prepared by steeping green gram, long pepper, cuscus grass and coriander overnight in it, or water prepared with chick pea or with the roots of job’s tears; or he may take the cold infusion of guduch, or sugarcane juice or milk.
32. He may also take fragrant sticky mallow or yellow chalk and fragrant sticky mallow, with rice water, or he may take white sandal wood with the juice of emblic myrobalan; or he may take adipsous and anti-emetic drugs mixed with honey.
33. He may also take the paste of sandal wood, chaba pepper, nardus, large grapes, fragrant sticky mallow and red ochre, with cold water, or the pulvis of red ochre, rice and trilobed virgin’s bower, with rice-water.
Treatment in Kapha-type
34. In vomiting [chardi] of the Kapha-type, it is beneficial to administer emesis with the emetic nut mixed with the decoction of long pepper, rape seed and neem, adding rock-salt with a view to cleansing the seat of Kapha and chyme.
35. The patient may take old wheat, Shali rice or barley, with the soups prepared with snake-gourd, guduch,and white flowered leadwort, or with the soups of the three spices and neem prepared with buttermilk, acidified with fruit acids and mixed with pungent articles.
36. The meat-juices and spit-roasted flesh of Jangala creatures, old honey-wine, Sidhu wine and medicated wines, or condiment, confectionary and beverages prepared of grapes, wood apple and citrons, may also be used.
37. The patient may take roasted green gram, lentils, chick-pea, and chickling vetch, mixed with dry ginger and honey; or, likewise, the pulvis of the three myrobalans and embelia, or the pulvis of embelia and rush nut.
38. Or, the powder of jambul and sour jujube or the powder of galls mixed with nut-grass, or cretan prickly clover, mixed with honey may be taken for stopping vomiting [chardi] of the Kapha type.
39. Or, one can subdue the generated urge for vomiting by taking the pulvis of red arsenic mixed with honey and black pepper iu the juice of the citron, or by taking the pulvis of long pepper mixed with honey and pepper in the juice of the wood-apple.
40. In conditions of vomiting [chardi] due to the discordance of all the three humors, the line of treatment to be followed consists of a judicious synthesis of the separate lines of treatment indicated by me for the derangement of individual humors, after the physician has first paid careful heed to the relative strength of the morbid humors, season, disease and the digestive power of the patient.
41. In case of a fit of vomiting induced by mental disgust, the following line of treatment should be resorted to: words which are agreeable, comforting and encouraging to the mind of the patient, popular legends and stories, congenial companions and wholesome diversions;
42-43. various kinds of mentally cheering odors of clay, flowers, and vinegar and fruits, well prepared vegetables, articles of food, drinks, well-seasoned condiments, confectionary, linctuses, soups, meat-juices, curd soup, curry soups, meat, cereals and various kinds of eatables; fruits and roots possessed of excellent odor, color and taste—the use of such things subdues the fit of vomiting.
44. In general, whatever odor, taste, contact, sound or sight is pleasing should be given to the patient, although it may be normally unwholesome. For, any disorders that may result from the use of such unwholesome agent, is easily curable.
45. The treatment of complication arising from vomiting [chardi] should be done according to the medication indicated in each case; and in case of excessive vomiting, treatment that is indicated in the condion [condition?] of excessive purgation should be carried out.
46. The Vata inevitably gets increased by the loss of body elements, caused by constant vomiting; hence, in case of vomiting persisting for a long time, medications which are curative of Vata and are anti-emetic and roborant should be administered.
47. Ghee-boluses, milk-therapy and medicated ghee such as Kalyanaka, the Three Spices and Life-promoter Ghees, virilific recipes, meat-juices and linctuses, subdue vomiting even of long duration.
Summary
Here is the recapitulatory verse—
48. The etiology, number, symptoms, complication, curability or otherwise, recipes and line of treatment for the relief of vomiting [chardi]—all these, the foremost of the sages has described in this chapter.
20. Thus in the Section on Therapeutics in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the twentieth chapter entitled ‘The Therapeutics of Vomiting [chardi-cikitsa]’ not being available, the same as restored by Dridhabala, is completed.
Definition
11. “Because it spreads in various directions, it is said to be ‘Visarpa’ or acute spreading affection. It is also known by the name of ‘Parisarpa’ because it spreads in all directions.
Seven varieties
12. This disease should be known to be of seven kinds by reason of the differences in morbidity and it affects seven different body-elements. There are three varieties of it due to the morbidity of individual humors; there is one variety which is due to the morbidity of all the three humors combined i.e. tri-discordance; and three varieties due to the morbidity of any two humors (i.e. bi-discordance).
13. Thus the Vata-type, the Pitta-type, the Kapha-type and the tridiscordance-type constitute four varieties and the remaining three varieties of bi-discordance-type will now be described.
14. The first is the ‘Fiery’ variety St. Anthony’s fire) due to Vata-cum-Pitta; the second is the ‘Nodular’ variety due to Kapha-cum-Vata and the third is the fearful ‘Kardamaka’ or slimy variety; this last is due to Pitta-cum-Kapha.
Sites
15. Blood, lymph, skin and flesh—these four body-elements, together with the three morbid humors (viz., Vāta, Pitta and Kapha) are to be known as the seven sites for the rise of acute spreading affections [visarpa] of all kinds,
Etiology
16-21. The following are the causative factors of the spreading affections [visarpa]: excessive indulgence in saline, acid, pungent and hot tastes as also in sour curds, whey, vinegarsand in Sura and Sauviraka wines; the use of stale or strong liquor or heat-inducing condiments and confectionary; the use of irritating vegetables and greens, cheese, inspissated milk and immature curds; the use of such fermented wines as Shandaki [śāṇḍāki], as also of pastries made of sesamum, black gram and horse gram and of oils, the use of the flesh of domesticated, wet-land and aquatic animals and of garlic; the use of food-stuffs that have gone soft or that are not homologous to one’s system or are mutually incompatible; overeating; sleeping during the day, predigestion-meals, eating on a loaded stomach; wounds, injuries inflicted by blows, ligatures or falls; over-exposure to sun, over-strain and poisonous gases or burns.
22. By combinations of the above-mentioned etiological factors, the Vata and the other two humors, getting provoked, affect the susceptible bodyelements such as blood etc., and spread in the whole body of persons who are given to unwholesome eating.
Curability or otherwise
23. These acute spreading affections [visarpa] have their habitats in the periphery, in the internal organs and in both these habitats at the same time. Their severity is to be known as progressively increasing, in the order of their statement.
24. The external affection is curable; that which spreads both externally and internally, is incurable and that which is internal is to be known as serious and can be cured only with great difficulty.
25. The humors provoked in the internal parts of the body spread causing the affection in the internal regions; if provoked in the external parts then in the peripheral regions, and if in both these regions they spread everywhere.
26-27. From the injury to vital parts, stupefaction, the forcible dilatation of the passages, excessive thirst and irregular discharge of the natural urges and the diminution of the gastric fire, the condition is readily recognised as affection of the internal type. From the contrary symptoms to these, the affection of the external type should be recognised and likewise other conditions by their characteristic symptoms.
28 That condition, all of whose symptoms and etiological factors are severe, which is associated with formidable complications and which has affected a vital part, proves fatal.
The Vata type
29. The Vata that is provoked by dry and hot articles of diet or by the blockage due to impletion, impairs the body-elements and spreads in proportion to its strength.
30. Its signs and symptoms are—general giddiness, burning, thirst, pricking pain, colic, body-ache, cramps, tremors, fever, asthma, cough, breaking and splitting pains in the bones and joints, trembling, anorexia, indigestion, agitation of the eyes, lacrimation and formication; the region where the inflammation is spreading becomes dusky-red in color and edematous. The patient suffers from severe pricking, splitting or aching pain in the part affected, as also extension and contraction of the parts, hyper asthesia and twitching. If not properly treated, it becomes covered with thin dusky red or dark eruptions which quickly break open and are followed by thin, clear, dusky-reddish and scanty discharge There is retention of flatus, urine and feces; and the factors described as causative of affection of Vata-type are not homologatory to the patient while the opposite factors are homologatory. These are the signs and symptoms of acute spreading affections [visarpa] of Vata-type
The Pitta-type
31 The Pitta accumulated by the use of hot things or by ingestion of irritant and acid foods, vitiates the susceptible body-elements, and filling the vessels, begins to spread.
32. Its signs and symptoms are—fever, thirst, fainting, stupefaction, vomiting, anorexia, body-ache, excessive perspiration, burning, delirium, headache, agitation of the eyes, insomnia, apathy, giddiness, excessive craving for cold air and water, greenish or yellowish coloration of eyes, urine and feces, greenish or yellowish appearance of the body. In the region where the inflammation spreads, the parts become swollen and acquire any of the following colors: coppery, greenish, yellowish, bluish, blackish or reddish. Then this swelling becomes affected with burning and splitting pain and covered with eruptions which break open soon and are followed by discharge of a similar coloration. The factors described as causative of Visarpa are not homologatory to the patient while the opposite kind of factors are homologatory. These are the signs and symptoms of acute spreading affection [visarpa] of the Pitta-type.
The Kapha-type
33 The Kapha getting accumulated by the ingestion of sweet, acid, salt, unctuous and heavy foods, as also by excessive sleep, vitiates the susceptible body-elements and spreads slowly in the body.
34. Its signs and symptoms are—chills, algid fever, heaviness, somnolence, torpor, anorexia, sweet taste in the mouth, formation of fur and sordes in the mouth, ptyalism, vomiting, lethargy, rigidity, loss of the gastric fire and prostration. Locally, in the region where the inflammation spreads, the part becomes swollen and is characterised by pallor or slight redness, greasiness, numbness, rigidness and heaviness, with only slight pain. It suppurates with difficulty and after a long time, and is studded with eruptions which are covered with a thick skin over them and are white or yellowish white in color. When this breaks open, there is white, slimy, fibrinous, dense, sticky and viscid discharge from it. Thereafter, it is followed by a heavy and firm network of sloughy covering firmly adhering to the wound. There is pallor of nails, eyes, face, skin, urine and feces and the factors, described as causative of Visarpa of this type, are not homologatory to the patient, while the antagonistic factors are homologatory. These are the signs and symptoms of the acute spreading affections [visarpa] of the Kapha-type.
Bi-discordance-type
35.Vata-cum-Pitta getting excessively provoked by their respective etiological factors and strengthened by each other, spread inflaming the affected region.
36. The signs and symptoms of this condition are—the patient affected with this type of Visarpa feels as if his body is sprinkled over with live coals. He is overcome with fits of vomiting, diarrhea, fainting, burning, faintness, fever, asthma, anorexia, pain in the bones and joints, thirst, indigestion, body-aches and similar other symptoms. Locally, the region where it spreads acquires the color of extinguished embers (blackish). They become covered with such blebs as are produced by burns due to fire. Owing to its rapid progress, it soon spreads to the vital regions. When the vital regions are affected, the Vata, which has become very strong, causes excessive disintegration of the tissues and leads to dullness of mental processes and produces hiccup, dyspnea and loss of sleep. The patient who has thus lost his sleep, whose mental processes are dulled and whose mind is afflicted, does not find relief anywhere. He is overcome with apathy, and desires to go to bed leaving his seat or standing position. Thus exceedingly exhausted he soon falls into a coma. Being very debilitated, he is roused from this state with difficulty. One afflicted with this fiery type of Visarpa is to be regarded as incurable.
37. Kapha-cum-Pitta, getting excessively provoked by their respective etiological factors, spread in the body causing softening of the tissues locally.
38. The signs and symptoms are—algid fever, heaviness of the head, burning, stiffness, flabbiness of the limbs, somnolence, torpor, stupefaction, repugnance to food, delirium, loss of digestive fire, prostration, pain in the bones, fainting, thirst, increased secretion in the channels, dullness of the senses, loss of the zest for living, subsultus ten dinum, bodyache, listlessness, anorexia and anxiety. Mostly, this kind of Visarpa spreads in the upper part of the alimentary tract. It spreads slowly and affects one region only. Locally, where this affection spreads, the part looks red, yellow or pale in color, as though, studded with eruptions. It is cyanosed, black, dirty looking, greasy, very hot, heavy, afflicted with dull pain, edematous, attended with deep suppuration, devoid of any discharge, rapidly softening, containing moist and putrid flesh and skin, and attended with gradual diminution of pain. On being touched, it spills like slush and when pressed, goes down (Pits on pressure); and softened and putrid flesh sloughs out exposing vessels and muscular tissues; it smells like putrid flesh and causes loss of consciousness and memory. The patient afflicted with this condition known as Kardama Visarpa, is to be regarded as incurable.
39. Kapha-cum-Vata gets provoked by the use of firm, heavy, hard, sweet, cold and unctuous articles of diet, by the use of liquefacient articles, by lack of physical exercise etc., ag also of seasonal purification. These two morbid humors, getting excessively provoked, vitiate the susceptible bodyelements and produce acute spreading affection [visarpa]. Thereafter the Vata, being obstructed by Kapha in its progress and making its way by dispersing Kapha in various directions, produces in due course a series of glandular enlargements which are slow in suppurating and difficult of cure in the habitats of Kapha. In the plethoric patient, it vitiates the blood and produces a series of localized swellings situated in the vessels, muscles, flesh and skin. These swellings may be acutely painful, large or small, oval or round in shape and of red color. As a result of this affection, the following complications arise—-fever, diarrhea, cough, hiccup, dyspnea, emaciation, faintness, discoloration, anorexia, indigestion, ptyalism, vomiting, fainting, body-ache, somnolence, listlessness, asthenia etc. The patient who is affected with these complications is too far gone for any therapeutic measures and is to be given up as incurable. Thus, the nodular type of Visarpa has been described.
40. Complication occurs as a sequela following and resulting from the main disease. It may be in the nature of a major or minor ailment. The sequela is so called because it is consequent on the disease. The disease is the main ailment and the sequela is secondary to the main disease. It generally disappears with the disappearance of the main disease. It is more troublesome than the main disease itself, because it appears in the later stages of a disease, when the body is already weakened. Hence, the physician should be very prompt in the treatment of complications.
Incurable type
41. The acute spreading affection [visarpa] due to tri-discordance, which results from the combination of all the etiological factors, which manifests a combination of all the signs and symptoms, which spreads in all the body-elements, which spreads very rapidly and which is excessively fulminating, should be regarded as irremediable.
42-(1). The three varieties of acute spreading affections [visarpa] namely the Vata type, the Pitta type and the Kapha type, are curable. The varieties, namely the fiery and slimy types of acute spreading affection, if not attended with complications, if not spread into vital regions, and if the vessels, muscles and flesh are not softened, can be subdued by the systematic and repea ted application of the general measures of treatment. If treatment is not properly carried out, either of these types of affections will destroy the body like a venomous serpent.
42. As regards the nodular type of acute spreading affection [visarpa], the treatment should be begun well before complications have supervened. The patient overtaken by complications is to be given up as hopeless. As regards the acute spreading affection of the tridiscordance type, it should be considered incurable as it gets spread into all, the body-elements, as it is of the fulminating character, and as there are mutually antagonistic measures involved in the line of treatment.
General Treatment
43. We shall hereafter [?desc??] the remedies for those varieties of acute spreading affections which are curable.
44. In the acute spreading affection [visarpa] that affects the habitat of Kapha and is accompanied with chyme-morbidity, fasting and emesis are recommended as also the use of bitter drugs and applications of drugs that are dehydrating and refrigerant.
45 The same treatment holds good in acute spreading affection that affects the habitat of Pitta and is associated with chyme-morbidity. In addition, blood-letting and purgation are specially to be carried out.
46. Even in the case of the disorder that affects the habitat of Vata, measures that cause the de-oleated condition of the system are indicated at first. Even iu spreading disorder of the hemothermic condition, the use of unctuous articles is regarded as contraindicated.
47. In disorders characterised by excess of Vata, as also by disorders Caused by Pitta of mild intensity, ghee medicated with bitter drugs is recommended; but if the Pitta is of great intensity, then purgation should be resorted to.
48. That patient, in whom the Pitta-disorder is of great intensity, should not be given ghee that does not cause purgation, for, the morbid matter thus getting occluded, consumes the skin, flesh and blood.
49. In view of this, it should be known that in acute spreading affections [visarpa], purgation is the first procedure that should be carried out and then blood-letting, for the blood is considered the support or the means for the spread of the disorders.
50. Thus has been described The therapeusis of Visarpa in brief. The subject is again dealt with in extenso.
Emesis in Visarpa
51. In Visarpa born of Kapha-cum-Pitta provocation, the physician should administer an emetic made of common emetic nut, liquorice, neem and the fruits of kurchi
52. In Visarpa, the administration of emesis with the decoction of the bitter snake gourd, neem, long pepper and emetic nut, as also with the pulvis of kurchi seeds, is recommended.
53. Further, all those medicaments which will be described in the Section on Pharmaceutics in connection with the disorders of Kapha and Pitta, are recommended im cases of Visarpa, for these medicaments are eliminative of morbidity and generally beneficial.
Tested Decoctions
54-54½. The skilful physician should administer, for the cure of acute spreading affections [visarpa], the decoctions of tested efficacy of nut-grass, neem, wild snake-gourd, or of sandal-wood and blue water lily or of Indian sarsaparilla, emblic myrobalan, cuscus grass and nut grass.
55-56. Or, he may administer for the alleviation of Visarpa, the decoction of chiretta, lodh, sandal-wood, Cretan prickly clover, dry ginger, the stamens of red lotus, blue water lily, emblic myroabalan, liquorice and fragrant poon.
57. Or, tubers of white lotus, liquorice, the stamens of the red lotus, blue water lily, fragrant poon and lodh may likewise be decocted and drunk.
58. For the alleviation of the thirst accompanying acute spreading affections [visarpa], as also of the disease itself, the physician should give a potion of the cold infusion made from grapes, trailing rungia, dry ginger, guduch and Cretan prickly clover, which have been, kept overnight.
59. The physician may also give the decoction of the wild snake-gourd, neem, Indian berberry, kurroa, liquorice and zalil, for the alleviation of Visarpa.
60. The patient may also take the decoction of the wild snake-gourd etc. (mentioned above), with the pulvis of the three myrobalans, or he may also take a potion of the aforesaid decoction mixed with the soup of lentil pulse and with ghee.
61 The patient afflicted with acute spreading affections should be given, as potion, the decoction of the leaves of the wild snake-gourd, green gram and emblic myrobalans, mixed with ghee.
Medicated Ghees
62.The intelligent physician may also give, for the alleviation of Visarpa, the ghee named Maha Tikta—the Great Bitter Ghee, which is laid down as curative of dermatosis of the Pitta-type.
63 The wise physician may also give, for the alleviation of Visarpa, the ghee made of zalil, which has been described as a tested remedy, for Gulma.
64-65 For the eradication of Visarpa, the physician may administer,- as a purgative, the pulvis of turpeth, mixing it well with ghee or milk, or the pulvis may be given in hot water or with the juice of grapes; or, milk in which zalil has been decocted may given to induce purgation.
66. The ghee mixed with the decoction of the three myrobalans and the pulvia of turpeth should be used as a purgative in cases of acute spreading affections [visarpa] accompanied with fever.
67-67½. Or, the juice of emblic myrobalans mixed with ghee may be given. The same combined with turpeth-powder is recommended in a patient with hard bowels. If the morbidity has passed into the alimentary tract, this should be the line of treatment.
Phlebotomy
68-70. If the blood has been vitiated in the peripheral region, then it is blood-letting that the physician should do at the outset The physician should perform depletion by the sudation method with the use of the cupping horn, if the blood has been vitiated by Vata; if by Pitta, by the application of leeches; and if the blood is vitiated by Kapha, then blood should be let by means of the vacuum method with the use of the bitter gourd. It is the vein that is situated nearest the site of the affection that should be promptly opened; for it is on account of the vitiation of the blood that the vitiation of the skin, flesh and tendons ensues.
71. When, by the above-mentioned procedures, the inside of the body has been purified, and the morbidity remains only in the skin and the flesh, or in the case of slight morbidity of humors from the very outset, the external treatment to be carried out, will now be described.
External Applications
72. An application of the paste of the bark of gular fig, liquorice, stamens of the red lotus and the blue water lily, fragrant poon and perfumed cherry, mixed with ghee is beneficial.
73- The paste made of the tend er aerial roots of the banyan tree together with the pith of the plaintain and lotus nodes, mixed with the hundred times washed Ghee, makes a good unguent.
74. A good application may also be made from the paste of yellow-sandal, liquorice, fragrant poon, rushnut, sandal wood, Himalayan cherry, small cardamom, lotus stalks and perfumed cherry, mixed with ghee.
75. Scutch grass, lotus stalks, the pulvis of conch-shells, sandal-wood, blue water-lily and the roots of the country willow, together with rice may be reduced to paste and used as an application.
76. The paste of Indian sarsaparilla, the stamens of the red lotus, cuscus grass, blue water lily, madder, sandalwood, lodh and chebulic myrobalan makes a good application.
77. Nardus and fragrant piper, lodh, liquorice, Himalayan cherry, scutch grass and calophany, mixed with ghee make a good application.
78. A good application may also be made of the paste of barley flour or roasted paddy flour, mixed with ghee, or of roasted barley flour mixed with liquorice, milky yam and ghee.
79 The physician may prepare a good application from the paste of heart-leaved sida, blue water lily, lotus rhizome, milky yam, eagle-wood, sandal wood or lotus stalks, taken with their tubers.
80-80½. Barley-flour mixed with liquorice and ghee makes a good application. Peas, lentils, green gram, and white Shali rice may be used with ghee, either singly or in combination, as an application.
81-81½. The cooling slush at the root of lotus, pearls and rice-flour or conch shells, coral, mother of pearl and red ochre should be used individually mixed with ghee as application. They are known to be beneficial in acute spreading affections [visarpa].
82-82½. The paste of the tubers of white lotus, liquorice, heart-leaved sida, lotus-tubers, blue water-lily, the leaves of the banyan tree and asthma weed, mixed with ghee, is good as application.
83-83½. So also the following viz., lotus-fibres, lotus stalks and the seeds of rushnut mixed with ghee, or the bulbs of the climbing asparagus and white yam, mixed copiously with the Washed Ghee.
84-81½. Moss and roots of the great reed, elephant’s foot, kidney-leaved ipomea and chaste tree, mixed with ghee, or the bark of the siris tree, heart-leaved sida and ghee;
85-85½. the cold application made from the tender roots of the banyan tree, gular fig, yellow barked fig tree, country willow and the holy fig, or from the paste of the barks of the above trees copiously mixed with ghee, is recommended.
86-86½. All the above-mentioned varieties of application are beneficial in disorders arising from the provocation of the Vata and Pitta humors. I shall now describe other kinds of application which are useful when the disorder is associated with predominant Kapha.
87-87½. In such a condition, an application may be made from the three myrobalans, Himalayan cherry, cuscus grass, sensitive plant, Indian oleander, roots of the great reed and Indian sarsaparilla.
88-88½. The physician may also give an application made from the paste of the bark of catechu, dita bark, nut-grass, purging cassia, cane tree, yellow nail dye and deodar.
89-92. (1) The leaves of the purging cassia and the bark of the assyrian palm; (2) twigs of chaste tree, sword bean and the flowers of the siris; (3) moss, the roots of the great reed, milky yam and perfumed cherry; (4) the three myrobalans, liquorice, milky yam and the flowers of siris; (5) lotus rhizomes, fragrant sticky mallow, the bark of Indian berberry, liquorice and heart-leaved sida; each one of these or each two of these or all of them together, may be used as an application. The application should in every case be made, mixed with only a small quantity of ghee
92½. In conditions of provoked Vata and Pitta, these applications should be mixed with plenty of ghee.
93-94½. Or, in such conditions an application consisting purely of the hundred times washed Ghee may be given. In acute spreading affection [visarpa] characterized by an excess of Vata and Pitta in the blood, the physician may repeatedly affuse the affected parts with the cold supernatant part of ghee, or with milk or with liquoricewater or with the cold decoction of the pentad of barks.
95-95½. The drugs which have been described above in the preparation of applications may also be used in the preparation of douches and ghees; they are also good as pulvis to be used for dusting the wounds of Visarpa.
96-97½. The ghee prepared in the expressed juice of scutch grass, makes a good healing unguent for wounds. The pulvis of the bark of Indian berberry, liquorice, lodh and fragrant poon is to be used as dusting powder; the pulvis of the bark of wild snake gourd, neem, the three myrobalans, liquorice and blue water-lily may be used either in the form of lotion, ghee, dusting powder or as application.
98-98½. All the above-mentioned clarificative applications should be given and should be applied at frequent intervals, having each time removed the previous application
99-99½. The previous application being removed without washing, a number of thin coatings should be applied at frequent intervals. In spreading affections born of Kapha, thick application should be applied and removed when dry.
100-100½. The coating of the paste applied should be as thick as one third of the thickness of the thumb. An application should be neither too unctuous nor too, dry, neither too solid nor too fluid, but of the right consistency.
101-101½. At no time should an application that has gone stale be made use of, nor should the same application be used a second time.
102-102½. Such an application will cause softening, acute spreading affection [visarpa] and pain in the affected part, on account of the accumulation of heat. If the application is applied over the bandage, it tends to promote perspiration in the affected part.
103-104. And as a result, pimples due to the retention of perspiration and pruritus are induced. If applications are made one over the other, the same undesirable results are produced as those mentioned in the case of applications over the bandage.
105 The application that is either too unctuous or too fluid does not adhere properly to the skin and cannot therefore alleviate the diseased condition.
106. Thin applications should not be applied, for, drying up rapidly, they become fissured and cracked. Consequently, the healing property of the drugs does not even reach the seat of affection, for it dries up quickly.
107. The undesirable consequences which ensue from the use of thin applications are also frequently produced by the use of applications that are not sufficiently unctuous; being quite dry they tend to aggravate the disorder further.
Diet in Visarpa
108-109. I shall now describe the diet that should be observed in the treatment of Visarpa. To patients that have undergone the lightening therapy, the following articles of food are beneficial; demulcent drink that is devoid of unctuosity. and is mixed with honey and sugar or that is sweet and slightly acidified by the addition of the juice of pomegranate and emblic myrobalans, or demulcent drink prepared with the fruits of sweet falsah, grapes and dates, in boiled water. Thereafter a linctus made of the flour of roasted barley and Shali rice and mixed with unctuous articles should be given.
110-111. When this is digested, the patient should eat a meal consisting of old Shali rice along with soups. These soups should be made of green gram, lentils and chick peas. They should not be made sour or if made sour, they should be rendered so with the juice of the pomegranate and prepared with wild snake-gourd and emblic myrobalan.
112. The patient should be nourished with the un-unctuous meat-juices of Jangala animals, mixed with the juice of sweet falsah, grapes, pomegranates and emblic myrobalans.
113. For such a patient, old and well-cooked rice of red, white and large varieties, in combination with Shashtika rice, is recommended as food.
114. Out of barley, wheat and rice, only that should be given to which the patient is accustomed and which is homologatory. Barley and wheat alone should be given to those patients to whom rice is not particulary suitable or who have an excess of Kapha in their constitution.
115. Patients suffering from acute spreading affections [visarpa] should avoid food and drink that are irritant, as well as all antagonistic indulgences, day-sleep, anger, exercise, exposure to the sun, fire and strong winds,
116. From among the remedial measures described above, those partaking mostly of a refrigerant nature should be employed in Visarpa of the Pitta type, those partaking mostly of a dry nature in Visarpa of the Kapha type and those of an unctuous kind in Visarpa of the Vata type,
117.In the Visarpa known as ‘Agni Visarpa’ or Erysipelas, the sedation, of the provoked Vata and Pitta is indicated; in the disorder known as ‘Kardama’ or of slushy type, the sedation of Kapha and Pitta is generally indicated.
118-119. The physician who knows the right time for. each remedial measure should, on finding that a spreading inflammation of the ‘Granthi’ or nodular type, is likely to result in a vitiated condition of blood and Pitta, treat the patient promptly with the procedures of de oleation, lightening, affusions, applications made from the five medicinal barks, blood-letting with leeches, with emesis and purgation and with ghees, that have been medicated with astringent and bitter drugs.
120. After the patient has been cleansed in the upper and lower regions of the body and blood-letting has been carried out, procedures alleviative of Vata and Kapha should be resorted to in affections of nodular type of Visarpa.
121. For patients affected with nodular Visarpa accompanied with severe pain, the use of. hot poultices with ‘Utkarika [utkarikā]’ pancake or with unctuous ‘Veshavara [veśavāra]’ i.e., prepared meat, is recommended.
122-122½. Or, the patient may be treated with hot affusions of oil medicated with decaradices or with hot affusions of the oil of costus mixed with prepared alkalis, or with hot affusions of cow’s urine or with hot decoctions of remedial leaves.
123. Or else, the patient may be treated with genially warm application of the paste of winter cherry.
124. Or, the patient may be smeared with the paste of dry radish, or of the bark of Indian beech or of the bark of the beleric myrobalan, applied warm.
125. In nodular Visarpa, the affected parts should be smeared with the paste of heart-leaved sida, gingo fruit, chebulic myrobalan, the knotted portions of the bark of birch, beleric myrobalan, bamboo-leaves and wind-killer,
126. An application made of the paste of red physic nut, the root-bark of the white-flowered leadwort and the milks of the thorny milk-hedge plant and mudar, gur, the seeds of the marking nut and green vitriol will break open even a stone.
126½. What then need be said of nodular affections born of Kapha, that are situated in the external regions of the body!
Remedies for Nodes
127-131. For breaking open chronic types of nodular affections, the following medications should be used, Soups made of radish and horse-gram mixed with alkalis and the juice of pomegranate, cooked wheat or barley mixed with Sidhu wine, honey and sugar: the top part of the Varuni wine mixed with honey and the juice of pomelo; the systematic use of the three myrobalans mixed with long pepper and honey, or of nut-grass, marking nut and the flour of roasted barley, or of honey, or of the bark of deodar and guduch and of mineral pitch; the use of fumigations and errhines, and of procedures described earlier as helping to break open the Gulmas, and also compression with iron, salt, stones, gold and copper.
132-132½. If despite the use of all these various proven methods of treatment the nodular swellings do not subside and are hard as stone, then cauterization by means of caustics or heated instruments or gold is useful.
133-134. Or, after maturating them with suppuratives or by incising them, the tumors may be removed. Further, the patient’s blood which is in a vitiated condition should be repeatedly let. After this, when the blood has been sufficiently let, the physician should administer medicine curative of Vata and Kapha. If even after the above methods, the morbidity is not allayed, then recourse to fumigation, errhines, sudation, pressure on the affected parts or use of suppurative drugs is recommended.
135-136. When the ulcers of Visarpa have become softened as the result of the above-mentioned procedures of cauterization and maturation, the physician should treat the condition with the measures employed in the case of wounds, by means of external and internal measures of purification and healing.
137. Kamala, ‘embelia’; Indian berberry and the fruits of the Indian beech should be reduced to paste. Oil should be cooked with this paste to make a good remedy for the ulcers of the nodular type
138. The intelligent physician, fully conversant with the aspects of place, time and classification, may also treat the ulcers of spreading affections [visarpa] according to the line of treatment indicated in the chapter on the ‘Two kinds of Ulcers’ (Cikitsā chapter XXV). Thus has been described the treatment of the nodular variety of Visarpa.
Goitre
139.Whatever line of treatment has been laid down in the cure of nodular type of Visarpa applies with equal force in the cure of goitre due to Kapha.
140. As regards those affections of goitre, which owe their origin to Vata and Kapha, they are prevented by the regular use of a diet consisting of ghee, milk and astringent articles.
141. If all the therapeutic measures described here as curative of Visarpa be put on one side and blood-letting on the other and weighed they will be found equal.
142. Visarpa never occurs without the association of the condition of hemothermia. Consequently whatever has been described here by way of remedial measures is the general line of treatment.
143. We have not, however, omitted to outline in brief, specific treatment relating to the special nature of morbidity requiring such treatment. The expert physician should call into service the entire therapeutic procedure, whether laid down in brief or in extenso.
Summary
Here are the recapitulatory verses:—
144-146. The definition of Visarpa, synonyms by which it is known, the morbid humors, the morbidised body-elements, the etiological factors, the habitat of the disease, the severity or mildness of the affection as determined by the way it spreads, the signs and symptoms, the complications, the nature of these complications, the curability or otherwise of a particular type, the remedial measures in due order of the curable types—all this, has Punarvasu declared in this chapter concerning the proven line of treatment for spreading affections [visarpa], to the inquiring and intelligent Agnivesha.
21. Thus, in the Section on Therapeutics, in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the twenty-first chapter entitled ‘The Therapeutics of Acute Spreading Affections [visarpa-cikitsa]’ is completed.
Etiology
4- 6. As a result of shock fear, fatigue, grief, anger, extreme inanition, alcoholism, constant use of alkaline, acid, salt) pungent, hot, dry and dehydrated food or emaciation due to loss of body-element or to disease, or of over agitation by purificatory procedures and excessive insolation, the Pitta and Vata get greatly increased and dry up the watery contents of the body-elements These two humors, becoming very strong, dehydrate the fluid carrying ducts and channels situated at the base of the tongue, throat, palate and Kloman and cause dipsosis [trishna] in a man,
7. Though he repeatedly drinks water, yet his thirst is not quenched. Such dipsosis arises as a complication due to severe diseases.
8. The premonitory symptoms are dryness of the mouth and the pathognomic symptom is constant craving for water. The reduction to a state of mildness of all the characteristic symptoms of the disease is the sign of its cure.
General symptoms
9-10. Dryness of the mouth, change of voice, giddiness, burning, delirium, rigidity, roughness of the palate, lip, throat and tongue, stupefaction, protrusion of the tongue, anorexia, deafness, sense of burning in internal organs and asthenia are the symptoms of dipsosis [trishna]. Now listen to the symptoms of each of the five varieties of dipsosis individually.
The Vata Type
11. When the provoked Vata absorbs the watery element in the body, the weak person gets dehydrated by the absorption of this fluid and consequently suffers from dipsosis.
12. Loss of sleep, whirling of the head, dryness and loss of taste in the mouth and occlusion of the channels are the symptoms of dipsosis of the Vata type.
The Pitta Type
13 The Pitta is regarded as the thermal element in the body. If it is provoked, it heats the watery element and the watery element being heated, there occurs thirst and excessive burning sensation in the man.
14. Bitter taste in the mouth, burning sensation in the head, desire for cold things, fainting and icteric tinge of the eyes, urine and the feces, are the signs of dipsosis [trishna] of the Pitta type.
Other types
15. Dipsosis [trishna] which originates from chyme morbidity is also of the thermal type as it originates from chyme and the Pitta. Its symptoms are anorexia, flatulence and ptyalism.
16. The body is made of colloidal fluid and the colloidal fluid of the body is in turn made of the aqueous element. The loss of this watery element induces thirst, the voice becomes low, the man becoms [becomes?] faint and his stomach, throat and palate get parched.
17. The dipsosis [trishna] which occurs as a complication in persons affected with fever, urinary disorders, wasting, consumption, dyspnea and similar other diseases, causes great dehydration of the body and is of the formidable type.
Prognostic Type
18. All varieties of dipsosis which are incessant, which occur in patients emaciated by disease and afflicted with continuous vomiting and which are attended with severe complications should be known as being indicative of approaching death.
General Theory
19 Thirst cannot occur without heat or without the Vata; the excessive increase of these two elements is the cause indeed of the absorption of the watery element, on loss of which, man is afflicted with thirst.
20. Even in a condition, where a person having taken heavy food, milk and unctuous articles, feels thirsty owing to the channels being occluded by the food-mixture during the digestive process, the Vata and the thermal element act as the causative factors.
21, Alcohol by its quality of being acute, hot and dry, provokes the Pitta and Vata. It is therefore that in alcoholic addicts these two factors dry up the watery element of the body.
22. Just as hot sand absorbs and dries up the water poured on it, so such heated persons find relief by the potion of ice-cold water
23.The body-heat of the person who has taken a cold-bath, being obstructed in the pheripheral region passes to the internal organs and creates thirst. Therefore, the person who is fatigued by insolation should not use cold water immediately.
24. In all these varieties of dipsosis [trishna], symptoms arising from the provocation of the Vata and the Pitta and loss of watery element of the body, are manifest. Hereafter I shall describe the treatment of dipsosis of the various types, one by one, according to the authoritative tradition.
General treatment
25. Owing to the loss of the watery element, thirst dehydrates the man and soon kills him; the patient should therefore drink pure rain-water with honey, or any other water having similar qualities.
26. The water that has got a slightly astringent secondary taste, which is light, cool, possessed of good smell and devoid of deliquescent quality, should be considered similar to celestial water in effect, though it be terrestrial.
27-28. The physician may give the water decocted with the roots of the pentaradices of the reed grass group cooled and mixed with candied sugar or the demulcent drink prepared of roasted paddy powder, sugar, honey and rain water; or he may give the top art of half cooked barlev gruel, cooled amd mixed with sugar; or he may give the thin gruel of Shali rice or of common millet.
29. Or, food may be given mixed with boiled milk or with honey and sugar, or mixed with the meat-juice of the pigeon and other birds of its group, seasoned with ghee without adding either acid or salt.
30. The meat-juices of Jangala animals well prepared with the roots of the pentad of grasses, salep and buchanan’s mango is recommended; or the milk prepared with the above drugs, mixed with sugar and honey.
31.Or, the patient, anointing himself with the Hundred times washed Ghee and taking a cold tub-bath, should drink milk or soups of green-gram, lentils and chick peas, seasoned with ghee.
32. The milk boiled with drugs of the sweet group, or life-promoter group, refrigerant and bitter group, mixed with honey and sugar, may be used as potion, inunction and affusion.
33. Or, the ghee prepared out of this medicated milk is beneficial as potion and inunction, as well as nasal medication. Breast milk or camel’s milk with sugar or sugar-cane juice is good as nasal medication.
34. The gargles of milk, sugar cane juice, gur-water, candied sugar, honey, Sidhu wine, grape wine, citron and pomelo are curative of dryness of the palate.
35. The applications of jambul, Indian hog plum, jujube, country willow, the pentad of barks and the pentad of acids mixed with ghee, when applied over the peri-cardial region, face and head, are curative of fainting, giddiness and thirst.
36. The unguent prepared of pomegranate, wood apple, lodh, white yam and citron or of whitish emblic myrobalans mixed with ghee and sour wheat conjee proves beneficial.
37-38. Or, the applications prepared of moss, mud and lotuses or with roasted paddy powder mixed with acid articles and ghee, or the application of wet cloth soaked in whey or sour wheat conjee or application of lotuses or of garlands of precious stones should be done. The cool contact of the breasts and hands of beautiful and beloved women clad in wet silken garments and besmeared with cool and fragrant waters or sandal paste, proves beneficial.
39. The recollection of or listening to the description of the Himalayan caves, woods, streams, lakes, lotuses, breezes, moonlight and other cool things as well as of lovely and cool waters- these have an allaying effect on dipsosis.
Special Treatment in Dipsosis [trishna]
40-40½. In dipsosis of the Vata type, soft, light and cooling food and d rink curative of Vata are recommended as also boiled ghee, which is churned directly from milk and which is indicated in the treatment of cough due to wasting and is curative of dipsosis [trishna] and dyspnea. In dipsosis due to Vata-cum-Pitta, the ghee taken out of milk prepared with the drugs of the life-promoter group of drugs, is recommended.
41-42. In dipsosis [trishna] of the Pitta type, the water mixed with grapes, sandal-wood, date, cuscus and honey, as also the cold water in which red Shali rice, Tandula rice, dates, falsah, blue water lily, grapes, honey and a baked lump of earth have been kept, may be given as potion.
43 Or, the water kept in an earthen pot in which 64 tolas of red Shali rice, pounded with lodh, liquorice, antimony and blue water lily are put and in which a baked clod of clay, water, and honey have been added, should be drunk. This is a curative drink in dipsosis [trishna].
44-45. In the water prepared with sprouts of banyan, pomelo, country willow, roots of sacrificial and thatch grass and liquorice, put a lump of black earth or black sand or pieces of new earthen vessel which have been heated red, and allow it to cool; then decant the clear water and give it to the patient; or give the water prepared with guduch heated with red-hot pebbles and cooled. It is curative of dipsosis.
46. The cold infusions prepared of the drugs of the lactiferous plants and drugs of the sweet group and of cold potency, mixed with sugar and honey and with baked clay put into them, are curative of dipsosis of the Pitta type.
47. In dipsosis [trishna] due to chyme morbidity, the defections of the three spices, sweet flag, marking nut and drugs of the bitter group prove beneficial; or the line of treatment, indicated in vomiting of the Kapha type, may be given.
48. Knowing that rigidity, anorexia, indigestion, lethargy and vomiting are the sequela of the Kapha-type of dipsosis, it is desirable to induce vomiting by a dose prepared of curds, honey, demulcent drink, salt and warm water.
49. The physician may give pomegranate or other sour fruit or the linctus mixed with astringent substances or he may give a potion containing turmeric and sugar.
50. Dipsosis [trishna] in men, born of wasting is equally serious like the cough due to wasting; therefore this variety of thirst should be quieted with medications indicated in the condition of cachexia due to pectoral lesions and consumption.
51-52. In dipsosis due to alcoholism, a potion of wine diluted with equal amount of water mixed with acid, salt and a liberal quantity of fragrant substances is recommended. In thirst immediately after a cold bath, a drink of diluted wine or gur-water is recommended. If thirst is due to abstinence from food or to ingestion of unctuous diet, the patient may take thin medicated gruel; if the thirst is due to a heavy meal, the patient may vomit out the food ingested.
53 And if the vitality of the patient be strong he may drink a dose of wine and water or warm water before vomiting or having cleansed the mouth with long pepper, he may take a demulcent drink with sugar.
54. If the thirsty patient is strong and suffers from parching of the palate, he may drink adipsous ghee, or use it in his food; if the patient is weak, he may take milk seasoned with ghee or unctuous meat-juice.
55. The thirst in persons who are extremely dehydrated and weak gets immediately quenched by taking milk or the cool and sweet meat-juice of the goat seasoned with ghee is a cordial drink.
56. The thirst resulting from eating unctuous food should be quenched with gur-water; and the thirst in a person who has fainted should be cured by medications curative of hemothermia.
57. In dipsosis [trishna], burning, fainting, giddiness, exhaustion, alcoholism, vitiation of blood and toxicosis, and disorders of Pitta, fresh cold water is beneficial, while in the condition of tridiscordance, water boiled and cooled is good.
58. In conditions of hiccup, dyspnea, recent fever, coryza, excessive ingestion of ghee, pleurodynia and disorders of the throat caused by Kapha and Vata, or when the humors are still congested in the body and just after the purificatory treatment, a drink of warm water is beneficial.
59. Tn anemia, abdominal diseases, coryza, urinary diseases, Gulma, weak gastric fire, diarrhea and splenic disorders the drinking of water is not beneficial; but if the thirst be unbearable, the patient may drink a small quantity of water.
60. For, if the patient who is suffering from the above-mentioned diseases has become miserably afflicted with thirst and craving for water, does not get it, he may soon die or be afflicted with chronic illness.
61.Therefore, the thirsty patient may drink coriander-water mixed with honey and sugar, or whatever other medicated water is wholesome in his condition.
Urgency of Treatment
62. If dipsosis [trishna] is cured, it is easy to subdue the complications arising from it; therefore dipsosis, of all diseases, should be first treated.
Summary
Here is the recapitulatory verse—
63.How the thermal factors and the Vata are the two causative factors for the five kinds of dipsosis [trishna], their separate characteristics, the incurable condition and the method of cure have all been described.
22. Thus, in the Section on Therapeutics in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka. the twenty-second chapter entitled ‘The Therapeutics of Dipsosis [trishna-cikitsa]’ not being available, the same as restored by Dridhabala, is completed.
Eight Stages of Poisoning
18-20½. In the first stage of poisoning, as, a result of vitiation of the body-nutrient fluid, there occur, at first, thirst, stupor, setting the teeth on edge, ptyalism, vomiting and prostration. In the second stage when the blood gets vitiated, there occur, discoloration, giddiness, tremors, faint ing, sternutation, tingling pain in the body and asthma. In the third stage of poisoning when the flesh gets vitiated there will be eruption, pruritus, edema, and wheals. In the fourth stage when there is vitiation of Vata and other humors there will be burning, vomiting, bodyache, fainting etc. In the fifth stage, there will be darkness of vision or vision of various colors. In the sixth stage, there will be hiccup; and in the seventh stage there will be paralysis of the muscles supporting the shoulder girdle. In the eighth stage, there occurs death. These are the eight stages of toxicosis [visha].
In animals and Birds
21-23. There are four stages in the case of quadrupeds and three stages in that of birds. In the animal, in the first stage, there will be asthenia and whirling; in the second stage the animal quivers, and in the third, passes into stupor and takes no food. In the fourth stage respiration becomes hard and it dies. The bird in the first stage of poisoning, feels depression and in the second stage whirling, in the third stage, its limbs get paralysed and death ensues.
The Ten Qualities
24. Lightness, dryness, quickness, dearness, diffusiveness, acuteness, expansiveness, subtleness, heat and indistinct taste are the ten qualities of posion described by toxicologists,
25-27. By its dryness it provokes the Vata, by its heat it provokes the Pitta, and by its subtleness it vitiates the blood. By its indistinctness of taste it provokes the Kapha and spreads quickly in the body-nutrient fluid. By its diffusive quality it spreads quickly in the entire body. By its acuteness it is injurious to the vital organs and by its expansiveness it destroys life. Owing to its lightness, it is difficult of treatment, and on account of its limpidness its flow cannot be stopped. Having reached the seat of the humor and according tothe habitus of the patient, it provokes other complications.
Symptoms
28.If the patient is of Vata habitus and the poison affects the seat of Vata, there will be marked symptoms of Vata and only slight symptoms of Kapha and Pitta. They are—thirst, stupor, apathy, fainting, spasm of the throat, vomiting and frothy salivation,
29. If a patient is of Pitta habitus and the poison affects the seat of Pitta, there will be marked symptoms of Pitta and only slight symptoms of Kapha and Vata. They are—thirst, cough, fever, vomiting, prostration, burning, darkness of vision and diarrhea etc.
30. If a patient is of Kapha habitus and the poison affects the seat of Kapha, there will be marked symptoms of Kapha and only slight symptoms of Vata and Pitta. They are dyspnea, spasm of the throat, pruritus, salivation and vomiting etc
31. The artificial poison vitiating the blood, causes ulcers and killoids, and the poison, vitiating gradually one another of the body-elements, kills the man ultimately.
32. The blood undergoes vitiation due to the fiery quality of the poison, and occludes the circulatory channels and kills the man. The poison, which has been taken orally, lies in the stomach of the deceased, while the poison in one that is stung or bitten ties in the region stung or bitten.
33-34. Cyanosis of the lips, loosening of teeth, falling off of the hair, paralysis of the body, rigor mortis, absence of horripilation at the touch of cold, non-formation of contusion-marks on the body in reaction to blows, absence of the flow of blood on
inflicting a wound—these are the signs and symptoms of death. Those, in whom the above symptoms are not seen, are to be treated. Now listen to the therapeutics, as I describe them.
Therapeutic Measures
35-37. Incantations, amulets, excision, compression, suction, cauterization by heat, affusion, bath, depletion, emesis, purgation, scalp-incision (Upa-dhāna), protection of the heart, eyemedication, nasal medication, inhalation, linctuses, sedative medications, alkaline applications, counter-poison, resuscitation, external application and re-animation—these four and twenty are the therapeutic measures Now listen to the narration of how and when each of them is to be administered.
Treatment of poisonous bite
38-38½. In the case of a poisonous bite, the physician should apply a ligature above the region of the bite and squeeze the part well, before the poison has spread in the body, or should try to cut out that part except in the region of the vital organs; or, the physician filling his mouth with barley-flour or earth must suck up the poison from the bitten area with his mouth.
39-43. Then, he should perform depletion of blood by wet-cupping, or with the horn or by leeching or by venesection. Else, the blood being vitiated by the poison, the entire body gets vitiated and the man dies Therefore the blood which does not flow out must be forced out by means of friction-massage- The three spices, kitchen soot, turmeric, the pentad of salts, ox-bile and Indian nightshade make a good rubbing powder for inducing bleeding. If the blood is flowing out too much, cooling application of the banyan and similar other trees should be given. The blood is the vehicle of the poison just as the wind is of fire. So it should be treated with applications and affusions. As a result of cooling measures, the blood congeals and the blood being congealed, the spreading of the poison is prevented. It is owing to the spreading of the poison that there occur intoxication, fainting, asthenia and tachycardia. So, this should be alleviated by means of cooling measures and the patient should be fanned till there is horripilation due to the cold induced.
44-45. Just as a tree ceases to grow when its root is cut, similarly by the excision of the bite, the effects of poison cease to develop. By suction the poison is induced to flow out; and the amulet ligatures act with regard to poison as a dam acts with regard to flowing water. Cauterization burns the poison which has spread into the
skin and the flesh, and depletion removes the poison from the blood. The poison which is drunk mast be removed immediately by emesis, and purgation should be given if symptoms of the second stage of poisoning have set in.
46. First, the heart should be well protected and whatever of the protective remedies for the heart are availabe should be used. The patient may immediately take honey, ghee, marrow, milk, red ochre or the juice of cow dung.
47. Or, the patient should immediately take boiled sugar-cane juice or the meat-juice squeezed out of crow’s flesh, or the blood of the goat and other animals of that group or ash or earth.
48. In the third stage of toxicosis [visha] he should take alkaline antidotes aud revulsive drugs that are curative of edema, together with honey and water. In the fourth stage of poisoning, he should take the juice of cowdung mixed with wood-apple, honey, and ghee.
49. In the fifth stage, he should use eye-salve and nasal medication prepared with the juice of sword bean and black siris; and in the sixth stage measures of resuscitation should be resorted to.
50. He should be given a potion of turmeric, madder, black pepper and long pepper mixed with ox-bile Finally, in the seventh stage he must take a potion of vegetable-poison in cases of poisonous bites, and bites by poisonous animals in the case of vegetable poisoning.
51. In the eighth stage, when the patient is apparently dead, the antidote of palas seeds mixed with double its quantity of peacock’s bile is good, or of Indian night-shade, treacle, kitchen soot, ox-bile and neem.
52. The pills prepared of cow’s bile, holy basil, root of long pepper, turmeric, Indian berberry, liquorice, and costas, or of the juice of siris flowers and sword bean act like ambrosia.
53. Applications, scalp-incisions, errhines and potions may be prepared out of the fruits of sword bean, holy basil, colocynth, hog’s weed, black night-shade and siris, for the cure of those that are apparently dead as a result of strangulation, or poison or drowning in water.
54-57. Melilot, rushnut, glory tree, yellow ochre, lichen, gall-stone, Indian valerian, ginger grass, saffron, nardus, the seed-blossom of holy basil, small cardamom, yellow arsenic, catechu, yellow-berried night-shade, siris flowers, pine resin, beetle killer, colocynth, deodar, lotus anthers,Sabar lodh, red arsenic, fragrant piper, jasmine flowers, flowers of mudar, turmeric Indian berberry, asafoetida, long pepper, lac, nut-grass, wild green gram, red sandal, liquorice, emetic nut, chaste tree, purging cassia, lodh, rough chaff, perfumed cherry, Indian groundsel and embelia; take the above mentioned articles in equal quantities under the asterism of Pushya, pulverise them and make into pills.
58-60. This pill counteracts all kinds of poison, gives success in treatment, and brings back to life those apparently dead due to the effects of poison, and is a febrifuge. By smelling it, by its application, by wearing it on the body, by fumigation with it and by keeping it in the house, all dangers from evil spirits, poisonous creatures, poverty, black magic, fire, lightning and foes are destroyed. It also obviates the fear of bad d reams, poisoning by women, premature death, drowning and fear of thieves. It bestows wealth, good crops and success in undertaking, auspiciousness, plumpness, long life and wealth. Thus has been described ‘The antidote that revives the dead (Mṛta-Saṃjīvana)’.
61. The tourniquet application, and stroking the poison down should be done to the accompaniment of chanting of incantations and also the protection of oneself from evil spirits. That humor should be first subdued, in whose habitat the poison has got localised.
62. When it is in the abode of the Vata, the procedures taken should be sudation and a potion of curds mixed with the paste of Indian valerian and costus. When it is in that of the Pitta, potion, tub-bath aud affusion with ghee, honey, milk and water should be given
63.When it is in the habitat of Kapha, alkaline antidotes as also sudation and venesection should be tried. When an artificial and slow poison is in the blood, blood-letting and all the pentad of purificatory procedures should be resorted to.
64. Treatment should be prescribed in this way by the wise physician, always after full consideration of all the factors. The habitat of the poison should first be attacked and the treatment should not be antagonistic to the particular humor abiding there
65-66. If a man has his channels of Kapha vitiated by poison and the passage of his Vata obstructed by the occlusion of channels and as a result, he breathes like a dying man, but does not show symptoms of incurability, he may be treated in the following manner. A crow-foot-like incision should be made over the top of his scalp and 4 tolas of the paste of soap pod should be applied over it and insufflation of the pulvis of white siris, kurroa and box-myrtle should be given.
67.The flesh of the goat, cow, buffalo or cock should be placed over the scarified area. Thus treated, the poison comes out.
68. In a condition of obstruction in the nose, eyes, ears, oral cavity and the throat, nasal medication with the pulvis of seeds of the Indian nightshade, citron, staff tree and similar other drugs may be administered,
69- In impairment of the vision, collyrium made of the paste of deodar, dry ginger, black pepper, long, pepper, turmeric, Indian oleander, Indian beech, neem and holy basil prepared with goat’s urine, should be used.

It should be painted on the anus in swollen piles, and on vaginal region of women in case of obstructed labor, and on the forehead in severe coryza. It is good as an application in conditions of enlargement of the scrotum, keloids, dermatosis, leucoderma, bulbous eruption etc. This perfumed Elephant Antidote eradicates disorders due to toxicosis [visha], even as an elephant uproots trees. Thus has been described ‘The perfumed Elephant Antidote known as Gandha-Hasti’.

90-94. While rubbing this paste during its preparation, the following efficacious holy incantation should be uttered: ‘My mother’s name is Jaya (victory) and my father also is Jaya (victory) and I am Vijaya (victory), the son of Victory Jaya and Jaya and hence I conquer. Salutation to the lion among beings, to God Vishnu, the maker of the world, to the eternal Krishna, the source and the glory of life. I am the very light of Vrishakapi the very light of Vishnu and that of Brahma, Indra and Yama. As surely as I have never heard of the defeat of god Vasudeva, and of the wooing of a mother’s hand and of the drying up of the ocean, so surely may this antidote achieve success by the truth of these words. O, thou, best among remedies, allied with Hili-Mili! give protection. Praise be unto thee’. Thus has been described ‘The antidote named the Major Perfumed Elephant Antidote, known as Mahagandha-Hasti’.
Other Remedies
95.Take Rishabhaka, Jivaka, beetle killer, liquorice, blue water-lily, coriander, fragrant poon, cumin seeds, white mussel shell creeper and the contents of jujube seeds. These, taken with water cure asthma, fever and other complications due to poisoning.

97. A linctus prepared of the contents of jujube seeds, dry extract of berberry, roasted paddy, blue water lily, honey and ghee is recommended in vomiting due to poisoning. The cigar rolled out of yellow-berried nightshade, Indian nightshade and leaves of pigeon-pea is curative of hiccup.
Fumigation
98. The fumigation with peacock’s feather, bones of the crane, rape seeds and sandal mixed with ghee is recommended for disinfecting houses, beds, seats, clothes etc. It is destructive of poisonous vermin.
99. Fumigate with Indian valerian costus, head of the king cobra and flowers of siris. This antidote is considered to be a destroyer of all kinds of poisons and to be curative of edema.
100. Fumigation with lac, fragrant sticky mallow, cinnamon leaves, gum guggul, marking nut, arjun-flowers, calophany and white mussel shell creeper, is the best destroyer of reptiles, mice, worms and of cloth-insects.
Alkali
101-104. Prepare alkali by [de?????] ashes of young palas and mix it with equal quantity of red ochre, turmeric, Indian berberry, and the ears of white holy basil, liquorice, lac, rock-salt, nardus, fragrant piper, asafoetida, dark blue sarsaparilla, Indian sarsaparilla, costus, dry ginger, black pepper, long pepper and saffron, till it becomes a semi solid paste.

Proper use of these pills cures all varieties of edema due to poisoning, Gulma, dermic disorders, piles, anal fistula, splenic diseases, edema, epilepsy, worms, spirit possession, vocal disorders, throataffection, anemia, dullness of gastric fire, cough and insanity. Thus has been described ‘The Alkali Antidote’.
105. The treatments for poisoning due to poisonous potion, bite, sting, and application have been described in general. Henceforth, listen to them described individually and in full detail.
106. There is danger to a king of being poisoned by persons employed,by his enemies as his own attendants and wives through the agency of food and other articles of daily use; therefore-the attendants should be carefully watched,
107. The man that is extremely suspicious, either very garrulous or very reticent, devoid of lustre in the countenance and has undergone change in his entire nature should be recognised as a potential poisoner.
108. Seeing such a person, the food given by him should not be taken straight way, but it should be tested by throwing a part of it in the fire. The fire burns abnormally undergoing various changes when food containing poison is cast into it.
109. The flames become variegated in color like the feathers of the peacock and the smoke is acrid, intolerable, dry and smells like a corpse. It burns with a crackling noise and the tongue of the flame curls a spiral or the flames get extinguished.
110. The food in the dish becomes discolored and the flies settling on it are killed. When eaten by the crows it makes their voices weak. When given to Cakora birds, their eyes suffer discoloration.
111. The potion containing poison becomes streaked with blue lines or becomes discolored. It fails to reflect one’s image or reflects it in a distorted form; and when salt is thrown into it there is effervescence.
112-113. The smell of poisoned eats and drinks causes headache, and if the heart gets affected, it causes faintness. Their touch causes swelling of the hands, loss of sensation, burning and pricking in the fingers and onychoclasis. When put into the mouth, they cause tingling of the lips and the tongue becomes swollen and numb and discolored. The teeth are set on edge and there occur rigidity of the jaw, burning in the mouth, ptyalism and throat disorders.
114, When the poison enters the gastric region, it produces discoloration, sweating, asthenia, nausea, impairment of the vision and heart and a condition where the body is covered with hundreds of bead-like eruptions.
115. When the poison reaches the lower part of the digestive tract, it produces fainting, intoxication, delusion, burning, asthenia, torpor and emaciation, and getting localized in the stomach, causes anemia.
116. If the poison is infused in the tooth-twig, the brush-like top part falls off and the swelling of teeth, lips and the flesh is induced. If the poison is mixed in the toilet-oil it causes the falling-off of the hair and pain and tumors in the head.
117. The poisoned collyrium causes burning in the eyes, tears, and excessive excretion of the eye, edema and redness. The eating of poisoned food and tactual contact with poisoned things, cause the vitiation, at the outset, of the stomach and then of the skin,
118. The bath, inunction, rubbing, clothes, ornaments, toilet-creams and similar other articles contaminated by poison, cause pruritus, pain, pimples, horripilation, tingling sensation and edema.
119-119½. The burning and pricking of hands and feet, exhaustion and indigestion are caused by contact with poison-contaminated earth, sandals, horse-back, elephant-back, armour, flags, beds and seats. The contaminated garland is odorless; it withers and causes headache and horripilation.
120. The poisoned smoke blocks the natural orifices and injures the nose and the eyes.
121. The poisoned water of wells, lakes etc., stinks, gets dirty, discolored and when drunk, causes edema, wheals and pimples, and even death.
122-122½. The physician should first of all administer emesis in cases of poison which has reached the stomach, and applications and affusions in cases of external contamination through the skin. He should treat the patient, having ascertained the strength of the humoral morbidity and the vitality of the patient. Thus have been described the particulars relating to ‘Root-poisons’.
Snake-poison
123. Now listen to the exposition of animal-poison. In the beginning the detailed treatment of snake-poison will be described,
124. The Indian Cobra, the Russel’s Viper and the Rajiman [rājimān] are regarded as the snakes provoking Vata, Pitta and Kapha respectively.
125. The Indian Cobra should be recognised by its spoon-like hood, the Viper by a round hood and the Rajiman by its variegated spots and lines on its body.
126. Their poisons are predominantly dry and pungent, acid and hot, and sweet and cool respectively. Hence they are provocative of the Vata and other humors corresponding to those three groups of qualities.
127. The bite of the Cobra shows minute marks of fangs and is black in color and the blood being prevented from flowing out, it causes a tor-toise-shaped swelling. It is regarded as causative of Vata-disorders.
128. The bite of the Viper shows deep marks of the fangs and the wound is spread over a large surface accompanied with edema- It is yellowish or yellowish-red in color and is causative of all varieties of Pitta-disorders.
129. The bite of the Rajiman causes soft and fixed swelling. It is unctuous and pale and contains thick blood. It is causative of various disorders of Kapha.
130. The snake that coils itself roundly, that has a huge body, that hisses and looks upwards and has a large head and an even body is a male; and the one possessing just the contrary characteristics is a female.
131-132 The serpent that is timid is sexless. The person, bitten by the female serpent, has drooping looks, shivers and suffers loss of voice; and symptoms contrary to these show a person to have been bitten by the male serpent. By a combination of these symptoms the person is to be known to have been bitten by a sexless serpent. Thus have been described the distinctive signs of the female, the male and the sexless among serpents.
133. The person bitten by a pregnant female snake is afflicted with pallor of the face, swelling of the lips and black coloration of the eyes; the person bitten by a female snake in her puerperal period is afflicted with yawning, auger, elongation of the little tongue and hematuria.
134. The snake known as lizardsnake, a hybrid offspring of the snake and the lizard, has four legs. It resembles the black snake in other respects. There are many varieties of cross-breeds.
135.Bites that are deep, round, very painful, inflicted by prolonged stay of the fangs and that have spread are very serious. The bites with other characteristics are not so serious.
136. Black snakes when they are young, the Gonasa when they are old, and the Rajlman in their middle age become as virulently poisonous as the serpents that kill by their mere look and breath.
137. The snake has four fangs: the lower left one, of them, is white in color, the upper left one is yellowish and the lower right one is reddish and the upper right one is dark.
138. The lower left fang of a serpent contains as many drops of poison as the drops of water that fall off a hair of a cow’s tail if dipped in water and lifted out of it.
139. The quantity of poison in the other fangs is greater in arithmetical progression in the order of their statement. The bites caused by them are similar in color to their own and are increasingly poisonous in the order of their statement.
Insect-poison
140. Insects, included in the category of worms (already described), are born of the fecal and urinary excrement of snakes themselves. They are divided broadly into two groups, one causing chronic poisoning and the other being destructive to life.
141443. The area bitten by the worms causing chronic poisoning, gets red, pale, black or dark in color, and covered with pimples and is afflicted with pruritus, burning, acute spreading affection, suppuration and putrefaction. Now hear the signs of the bite which leads to death. On the site of the bite, the same type of swelling develops as in the case of snake-bite, accompanied with bleeding and strong smell. The patient suffers from heaviness in the eyes, fainting, pain, dyspnea, thirst and anorexia, when bitten by creatures causing slow poisoning.
144-144½. When there is in the centre of the bite, a network-like black or dark patch resembling a burn, and there is also excessive suppuration, sloughing, swelling and fever, it should be diagnosed to be a bite by a spider causing slow poisoning.
145-146. Here are described the symptoms of the bite by all kinds of poisonous spiders. There occur swelling, pimples of pale, black red or yellow color, fever, terminal dyspnea, burning, hiccup and stiffness of the head.
147. Immediately after a bite by a rat causing slow poisoning, pale blood flows out; circular patches on the body appear as well as fever, anorexia, horripilation and burning
148. Fainting, edema of the limb, discoloration, sloughing, deafness, fever, heaviness in the head, ptyalism and hematemesis are the symptoms of the incurable type of rat-bite.
149 Dark or black coloration or variegated coloration, stupefaction aud passing of loose motions are the symptoms of the bite of a chameleon.
150. The poison of the scorpion causes burning like fire aid then a cutting pain rapidly spreads upwards; but afterwards, it gets localized in the area of the bite.
151. A person stung by the incurable type of scorpion, looses the function of sight, smell and taste and suffers the sloughing of tissues and great pain and gives up his life.
152 Acute spreading affection, edema, colic, fever and vomiting are the symptoms of the sting of a poisonous hornet The site of the sting sloughs away.
153. The person stung by the crab Is afflicted with horripilation, rigidity of the phallus, and excessive pain and feels as if his body were affused with cold water.
154. If, in the bite by a poisonous toad, only a single fang has pierced, there is edema accompanied with pain, icteric tinge of the body and thirst. Vomiting and drowsiness are the symptoms of the bite by all types of poisonous frogs

In praise of Wine
3-10. Wine, that was greatly worshipped of old by the gods and their bug, that which was invited by the ritualist and established in the sacrifice called Sautramani, she that upholds the sacrifices, that by which devitalised Indra was uplifted from the impenetrable gloom of faintness into which he had fallen by excessive addiction to Soma, that which is worthy of being seen, touched and mixed by holy men who offer sacrifices in the manner prescribed by the Vedas, that which is derived from a variety of sources and yet has the one common quality of intoxication, that which endows the gods with choicest prosperity in the form of ambrosia, the manes in the shape of ‘Svadha’ and the twice-born in the shape of ‘Soma’, that which is the splendour, might and the wisdom of the Ashvin twins, that which is the power of Indra, that which is the ‘Soma’ prepared in the ‘Sautramani [sautrāmaṇi]’ sacrifice, that which is the destroyer of sorrow, unhappiness, fear and distress, which is powerful, and which itself turns into and causes love, joy, speech and nourishment, and beatitude, that which has been praised as the joyful wine by the gods, Gandharvas, Yakshas, Rakshasas and mortals, should be taken in the enjoined manner.
11-20. Having attended to the internal and external needs of the body and having bathed and painted himelf with fragrant sandal, a person must wear clean clothing along with ornaments and fragrance suitable to the season. Then decking himself with garlands of variegated flowers and with jewels and ornaments, he should worship the gods and the Brahmanas and touch the most auspicious articles. Seating himself comfortably in a sitting or lounging position on a well made bed with pillows, in a spot scattered with flowers that are best suited to each season and fumigated with fragrant smoke, he should drink wine, always in vessels of gold or silver or vessels set with precious stones or other vessels clean and well shaped. He should drink while being shampood by clean, loving, beautiful, young and well trained women decked in fine clothes, jewels and flowers suitable to the season. He should eat, while drinking, green fruits and salted fragrant flesh and other sauces agreeable to the wine and proper to the season, and the fried flesh of many hinds of creatures of the land, water and the air and many kinds of puddings made by expert cooks. He should drink, having prayed to the gods and having first received their grace and having poured the libations of wine on the earth, mixed with water for the desiring spirits.
21. The person of the Vata habitus should take inunction, oil-massage and bath, and put on good raiment, treat himself to fragrant smoke and paint himself with sandal paste and should take the food prepared with unctuous and hot articles; after that, he should drink wine.
22. If the person with the Pittahabitus, after treating himself to various cooling things such as bath etc., and eating food consisting of sweet, unctuous and cooling articles, takes wine, it will not impair his health.
23. The person of the Kapha-habitus, living on food prepared of barley and wheat, should treat himself to hot things and eat the flesh of Jangala animals prepared with black pepper and then take wine.
24. This is the procedure of drinking in the case of rich people and those who are, yet on the path to prosperity, should treat themselves to things that are available according to their circumstances and should drink wine in wholesome doses.
25. For persons of Vata-habitus wine prepared of gur and flour is wholesome; while the persons with Kapha-cum-Pitta habitus should take grape-wine or honey-wine
Merits of Right Mode of drinking
26. Wine is prepared from various substances and possesses various qualities. It has various actions on the body. It is intoxicating in nature. Hence it should be viewed from the point of both its good as well as its evil effects.
27. If a person takes it in right manner, in right dose, in right time and along with wholesome food, in keeping with his vitality and with a cheerful mind, to him wine is like ambrosia.
28. While to a person who drinks whatever kind comes in hand to him, and whenever he gets an opportunity and whose body is dry due to constant exertion, that very wine acts as a poison.
The action of Alcohol
29. Alcohol reaching the brain, disturbs all the ten qualities of the vital essence by its ten-fold nature of action and thus leads to the derangement of the mind (protoplasmic poison),
30 They are—lightness, heat, acuteness, subtleness, acidity, diffusiveness, quickness, dryness, expansiveness and limpidness. These are described to be the ten qualities of alcohol.
31. While heaviness, coldness, softness, smoothness, denseness, sweetness, fixity, clearness, viscidity and unctuousness are laid down as the ten qualities of vital essence.
32-34. Heaviness is destroyed by lightness, coldness by heat, sweetness by acidity, softness by acuteness, clearness by quickness, unctuousness by dryness, fixity by diffusiveness, smoothness by expansiveness., viscidity by limpidness and density by subtleness. Thus alcohol by its characteristic actions, destroys the ten qualities of the vital essence. It acts as a protoplasmic poison. As a result., alcohol agitates the mind, and its foundation, namely the heart, and quickly produces intoxication.
35. The heart is considered to he the seat of the circulatory channels of the body nutrient fluid, the Vata and other humors and of the mind, intellect and the senses, as also of the vital essence
36. By excessive use of alcohol and the resulting impairment of the vital essence, the brain becomes disordered along with the body-elements situated there.
37. In the first stage of intoxication, the vital essence is not affected but the mind becomes stimulated. In the second stage, the vital essence is slightly affected and in the third stage, it is completely affected.
38. The wine prepared from flour does not produce much impairment of the vital essence, because the qualities of expansiveness, dryness and clearness are not in it in a pronounced degree.
39-40. When the brain is affected by the action of alcohol, there will result exhilaration, ardent desire, exultation, sense of happiness and various kinds of changes according to the psychic make-up of the person and according to its Rajasic or Tamasic qualities. Owing to excessive use of alcohol, stupor terminating in narcosis is produced. This is the delusion caused by wine and is known as alcoholic intoxication.
The Three stages of intoxication
41. Three stages of intoxication are observed in a person who drinks wine the first, the middle or the second and the last or the third. We shall describe the characteristics of each of them.
42-43. It produces exhilaration, delight, a finer discrimination of the qualities of food and drink, desire for music, song, jokes and stories. It does not impair the intellect or memory and
causes no incapacity for sense-pleasures. It promotes sound sleep as well as happy awakening. This is the first and the happy-stage of alcoholic effects.
44-45. Fitful recollection, fitful forgetfulness, frequent, indistinct, thick and laryngeal speech, indiscriminate talk, unsteady gait, impropriety in sitting, drinking, eating, and conversation—these are to be known as the symptoms of the second stage of alcoholic effects.
46. After transcending the second stage and before reaching the last stage, there is no impropriety which persons of the Rajasic and Tamasic nature will not commit.
Evils of intoxication
47. Which wise man would ever wish to be intoxicated to an extent which is as frightful as insanity, even as no traveller would select a road which leads to an unhappy end and which is beset with many troubles?
48. Having reached the third stage of intoxication, he becomes paralysed like a felled tree, with his mind submerged in intoxication and stupor, and though alive he resembles a dead man.
49. He does not discriminate between or recognise the qualities of things or his friends He does not possess even a sense of his own happiness for the very sake of which alcohol is drunk.
50. Which wise man would like to attain that state in which he cannot discriminate between what ought to be done and what ought not to be done, between pleasure aud pain and between what is good and what is evil in the world?
51. On account of his addiction, he is condemned and censured by all people and is regarded an unworthy man by them. He gradually develops painful diseases as a result of his addiction.
52. For all men, all that which is contributive of well-being in this life and in the other, and happiness in that higher life of liberation, is established in the perfect tranquility of the mind.
53. Wine causes great agitation to such a tranquil mind, like the strong wind that shakes the trees on a bank.
54. Ignorant men, who are addicted to and are binded [blinded?] by intoxication and overcome by passion and ignorance, consider the intoxicated state which is a greatly morbid and diseased condition, to be a state of happiness.
55. These men enslaved and blinded by alcoholism [madatyaya], are deprived of wisdom and Sattvic qualities and are lost to all goodness.
56. Wine is also the cause of great delusion, fear, grief, anger and death as well as of insanity, toxicosis, fainting, epilepsy and convulsions.
57. When a man is deprived of his very memory, then everything that follows upon it, is necessarily evil. Thus, those who know the evils of drink, condemn the drink-habit strongly.
58. True and undoubted indeed are these great evil effects described about wine, if it is unwholesome or taken in excess, or taken in disregard of the prescribed regulations.
59. But wine, by nature, is regarded as similar to food in its effects. It is productive of disease if taken in improper manner, but is like ambrosia if taken in proper manner.
60. Even food, which is the life of living creatures, if taken in improper manner, destroys life, while poison, which by nature is destructive of life, if taken in proper manner, acts as an elixir
Merits of Measured drinking
61. Wine taken in proper manner soon induces exhilaration, courage, delight, strength, health, great manliness and joyous intoxication.
62-64. It is an appetiser, digestive-stimulant, cordial, promoter of voice and complexion and is nourishing, roborant and strengthening. It relieves fear, grief and fatigue. It acts as a soporific to those suffering from insomnia and as a stimulant of speech in reticent people. It keeps awake people given to excess of sleep, and relieves, obstruction in the body-passages, renders the mind unconscious of the pain of trauma, ligature and other kinds of pain and suffering. It acts as a cure for the disorders resulting from alcoholism [mada-atyaya].
65. It increases the enjoyment of sense-pleasures and the desire for the continuance of such pleasures. Even to the very aged, alcohol gives elation and delight.
66. There is nothing comparable on earth to the delight derived, during the first stage of alcoholic effects, from the perceptions of the five senses in the case of either the young or the aged.
67. Alcohol, taken in the proper way, is a relaxation for all people afflicted with a multitude of sufferings and sorrows.
68. One should take wine keeping always in view the threefold classification in each of the six things—food, drink, age, disease, vitality and season. as well as the triad of morbid humors and the triad of the psychic types.
69. The correlating of the triads of these eight factors is known as the proper mode, and the use of alcohol taken in such proper mode is never attended with the evil effects of drinking.
70. On the contrary, the person enjoys all the good effects ascribed to drinking, and without endangering his virtue or wealth, he obtains the exalted state of the mind.
71. Generally, in the first stage of intoxication, mental faculties get stimulated. In the second stage, the real nature of the man is slightly revealed and in between the second and the third it is fully revealed
72. As rain stimulates the growth of crops and fire reveals the quality of gold, similarly drink produces both these effects on the minds of men.
73. Just as fire reveals the high, medium and low quality of gold similarly, drink reveals the true type of the mind conerned.
74-75. That is the Sattvic manner of drinking where it is drunk after adorning oneself with fragrant flower garlands and to the accompaniment of song, where the wine has been properly prepared and pure, and taken along with delicious and clean foods and drinks, which is drunk always to the accompaniment of delightful conversation, which is taken in happy mood, which is attended with a healthy sense of exaltation and which increases cheerfulness and love, which has a happy termination and which does not lead to the extreme state of intoxication.
76. The people of Sattwic temperament are not immediately subject to the morbid effects of intoxication. Wine cannot quickly impair the qualities of a strong mind.
77 That is the Rajasic manner of drinking which causes speech that is partly gentle and partly rude, partly distinct and partly indistinct and varying every moment in its nature and is incoherent and generally ending in an unhappy condition.
78. That is regarded as the Tamasic manner of drinking wherein speech that is not characterised by cheerfulness and affection is indulged, where there is no satisfaction in the food and drink taken, and which terminates in delusion, passion and sleep.
79 It is therefore that a man should recognise, among those given to drink, the men of the Sattvic type by means of the aforesaid characteristics and avoid the company of the Rajasic and Tamasic types so as to avert the risk of the morbid effects of drinking after their manner.
Proper Company at drinking
80-82. The men of excellent character, those that are pleasant of speech, that are amiable in expression, that are applauded by the good, that are versed in the arts, that are clean of heart and quick in the grasp of things, those that are mutually helpful and whose coining together is out of sincere friendship, who enhance the pleasure of drinking by their joy, affection and sweetness of manner and the sight of whom causes mutual increase of joyous spirits—such men indeed make happy companions at drink, for, by drinking in their company, one enjoys delight.
83-84. They indeed are equal to the most blessed of men who drink in the company of such good friends while enjoying the pleasures of lovely objects of the five senses of sight, smell, taste, touch and hearing and paying due heed to the circumstances of place and time and with a joyous heart.
85. Those who are strong of mind and body, those who are habituated to drink after meals, those who have inherited the habit of drinking and those that have by practice got habituated to large doses of drink, do not get quickly intoxicated
86-87. Those men who are afflicted with hunger and thirst, who are debilitated, who are of Vata or Pitta habitus, who are given to dry and insufficient and very limited diet, who are sluggish in digestion aud who are mentally weak, those that are of wrathful nature, those that are not habituated to drink, those that are emaciated, those that are greatly exhausted and those that are suffering from lesions due to alcoholism [madatyaya]—all such, get intoxicated quickly even with a small dose of wine,
88. Agnivesha! Hereafter I shall describe the etiology, the signs and symptoms and the therapeutics of each type of alcoholism [mada-atyaya], in due order.
Etiology and Symptoms
89-90. If a person that is greatly emaciated by indulgence in women, by grief, fear, load-carrying, way-faring and such other strenuous activity, or if a person, habituated to dry, scanty and limited diet takes dry and highly fermented wine in excess at night and loses his sleep, he will soon be subject to alcoholism [madatyaya] of the Vata type.
91. Hiccup, dyspnea, tremors of the head, pleurodynia, insomnia and excessive garrulity are to be known as the signs and symptoms of alcoholism [mada-atyaya] of the Vata-type.
92-93. He who takes strong, acute and acid wine and who habitually takes acid, hot and acute articles of diet, who is of an irritable temperament and who loves exposing himself to the fire and the sun, will be subject to alcoholism mostly of the Pitta-type. But in a person with excess of Vata, this alcoholism due to Pitta either subsides immediately or causes death.
94. Thirst, burning, fever, perspiration, fainting, diarrhea, giddiness, and icteric tinge of the body are to be known as the symptoms of alcoholism of the Pitta type.
95-96. In a person who excessively drinks fresh wine, mainly sweet or prepared of gur or Hour, who is habituated to sweet, unctuous and heavy diet and who is given to non-exercise, day-sleep and the pleasures of a sedentary and indolent life, soon develops alcoholism [madatyaya] which is of the Kapha-type.
97. Vomiting, anorexia, nausea, torpor, rigidity, heaviness and chilliness are to be known as symptoms of alcoholism of the Kapha-type.
98. Whatever qualities in poison are observed to provoke the tridiscordant condition, the same are also observed in alcohol. In poison they are of a stronger nature.
99. Some poisons kill immediately while others lead to diseases. The last stage produced in alcoholic intoxication should be regarded as similar to poison in effect.
100. Therefore, the symptoms born of tridiscordance are observed in all types of alcoholism [mada-atyaya]; but owing to the predominance of special symptoms in each type, they are classified into separate categories.
101-106. Severe aches in the entire body, stupefaction, cardiac pain, anorexia, incessant thirst, fever with the characteristics of either cold or heat, lightning-like pains in the head, sides of the chest, bones and joints; severe pendiculation. throbbing, twitchings, fatigue, obstruction in the chest, cough, hiccup, dyspnea, insomnia, tremors all over the body, disease of the ear, eye and mouth, stiffening of the waist, vomiting, diarrhea and nausea of Vata, Pitta or of the Kapha type, giddiness, delirium, hallucinations of sight and bewilderment of the mind and a feeling of being covered with hay, ash, creepers, leaves or earth, and that of animals and birds crawling over his body, as well as dreaming of unhappy and inauspicious dreams—all these, are to be regarded as the symptoms of alcoholism.
107. All kinds of alcoholism [madatyaya] are to be known as resulting from tridiscordance; the physician should treat first that particular humor which is observed to be most predominant in alcoholism.
108. In alcoholism [mada-atyaya] the line of treatment should generally begin with the seat of Kapha and then of Pitta and lastly of Vata.
109. Diseases arising from wrongful, excessive and too meagre use of alcohol are alleviated by taking it in the right measure.
110-111. When the morbid effects of all the alcohol ingested are completely abated and the body becomes lighter and the patient develops a craving for drink, the physician, who is expert in posology, should give him wine which is agreeable to him mixed with sanchal and rock salts combined with the juice of the citron and ginger and cooled and diluted with water.
112-113. The excessive drinking of acute, acid and irritant wine causes dilution of the food-juice by excessive secretion, specially of mucus, leading to misdigestion and alkaline formation leading quickly to internal heat, fever, thirst, stupor, giddiness and intoxication; wine itself should be given to alleviate the condition.
114. The alkali quickly changes to sweet taste when mixed with the acidity of wine neutralization of alkali by acid). Listen now to those qualities of wine by which it is considered to be the best of acids.
115-116. The wine of sour taste is regarded to have four after-tastes. They are sweet, astringent, bitter and pungent tastes. On account of these four tastes and the ten-fold actions described previously, wine is the super-most among acid substances.
117. The Vata, blocked up in the channels as a result of the precipitation of the morbid humors by alcohol, causes acute pain in the head, bones and joints.
118. In this condition, the patient should be given wine in spite of its acid quality for the liquefaction of the morbid humors by its diffusive, acute and hot qualities.
119. When taken regularly, wine is wholesome, relives the obstructions in the channels, regulates the peristaltic movement of Vata, acts as an appetiser, stimulates the gastric fire and becomes homologatory by habituation.
120. The channels carrying the body-fluid being cleared and the peristaltic movement of Vata getting regulated, the pains and disorders due to alcoholism [madatyaya] subside and the Vata due to intoxication abates.
Treatment in Vata type
121-122. For the alleviation of Vata the patient should be given wine prepared out of pastry, acidified with citron, kokam butter, jujube, pome granate and sprinkled with the powder of bishop’s weed, common juniper, cumin and dry ginger, and flavoured with sauces and mixed with a little of salt and fried barley powder and with unctuous articles.
123-124. Recognising the symptoms of provoked Vata, the patient should be treated with unctuous, sour and well prepared meat-juices of common quail, partridge, cock and also of pea cock and of birds, beasts and fishes of the wet land group and with the meat-juices of terricolous creatures and the tearer group of beasts and birds, mixed with cooked Shali rice.
125-126. The patient of Vata habitus should be treated with unctuous, hot, salt, sour and delicious Veshavara [veśavāra], a variety of preparations of wheat flour mixed with supernatant part of Varupi wine, and with unctuous pan-cakes and puffs stuffed with meat and ginger and with pan-cakes prepared out of black gram,
127-128. Or, he may be given the flesh of the fatty creatures previously described, prepared with black pepper aud ginger and with a small quantity of unctuous substance and without any acid, or mixed with pomegranate juice; or, he may be given the pudding prepared with the three spices, coriander. black pepper and ginger, taken with genially warm pan cakes.
129-130. When the patient gets thirsty after meals, he should be given the supernatant part of Varuni-wine as potion, or the juice of pomegranate or the decoction of pentaradices or the water boiled with coriander and dry ginger or whey or the supernatant part of sour gruel or vinegar.
131 By the administration of this tested remedy in proper dose and time, the disorder gets alleviated and the patient’s vitality and complexion promoted.
132-135. By various kinds of Riga and Sadava confections and various appetisers which make the patient relish the food, meat-preparations, vegetables, pastry and barley, wheat and Salt rice and by the aid of inunction, dry massage, hot baths, covering with thick blankets and smearing the body with the thick paste of eagle-wood, and fumigation with the aid of dense smoke of eagle-wood, and by the aid of affectionate embraces of women’s bodies full of the warmth of youth, by the warm clasp of their waists, thighs and full grown breasts, by the warmth of the bed and the cover and the warmth of happiness and cheer of the interior apartments, alcoholism of the Vata-type gets subdued effectively.
Treatment in Pitta-type
136-137. In alcoholism [mada-atyaya] of the Pitta type, wine added with sugar, wine made of sugar, grape-wine or any other variety of wine, diluted with plenty of water mixed with the juices of showy dillenia, dates, grapes, sweet falsah and pomegranate, and sprinkled with roasted paddy flour and cooled, should be given as potion, at the proper time.

139. Or, meat-juice of the goat may be prepared with the soup of the wild snake-gourd or with the soup of math-gram and green-gram mixed together and acidified with the pomegranate and the emblic myrobalan, and may be given.
140. Various demulcent drinks, gruels and meat-juices may be prepared out of the juices of grapes, emblic myrobalan, dates and sweet falsah.
141-142. Finding that the Kapha and the Pitta are in a provoked condition in the stomach of the alcoholic patient and that he. is afflicted with thirst and burning due to excessive morbidity, the physician should first give him wine, grapejuice, water or a demulcent drink and then immediately administer emesis so as not to allow any residue to remain in the stomach. In this way, the patient gets quickly cured of his condition.
143. When he desires food, he should be given demulcent drink and treated systematically with the rehabilitation-procedure. As a result, his gastric fire gets enkindled and digests the residual fraction of morbidity as also the food.
144-145. In conditions of cough, spitting of sputum mixed with blood, pleurodynia, mammary pain, thirst, misdigestion, agitation in the stomach and chest, the physician should give soup of guduch, large variety of nutgrass or of snake-gourd, mixed with dry ginger, followed by a diet of partridge flesh.
146. If the patient is afflicted with great thirst owing to excessive provocation of Vata and Pitta, he may be given grape-juice to drink, as it is cooling and a regulator of the humors.
147-147½. When this potion has been digested, he should be fed with a diet of the meat juice of the goat, mixed with sweet and sour things and when thirsty, wine should be given as post-prandial potion. That is the proper dose for the post-prandial potion, which does not adversely affect the mind.
148-148½. When thirsty, he should be given wine frequently and in small quantities, diluted liberally with water so as to quench his thirst and also avoid intoxication.
149-150. The patient may drink the cold infusion of sweet falsah or tooth-brush-tree-water or the cool decoction of the tetrad of leafy drugs, (ticktrefoil, painted leaved uraria, wild green gram, wild black gram) or the adipsous juice of nut-grass, pomegranate and roasted paddy,
151. The juice of the sour pentad viz., jujube, pomegranate, kokam butter, yellow wood sorrel and country sorrel, used as a mouth-paint, immediately quenches the thirst.
152-155½.

The physician may make use of whatever other things there are, which have a cooling potency.
156-156½. In burning due to excessive drinking, the touch of the petals of white lily and night-flowering lotus, wetted with sandal water as also the touch of pleasing objects, is beneficial.
157-157½. The narration of wonderful stories, the pleasant cries of the peacock and the rumbling of thunder alleviate the effects of intoxication.
158-158½. Various devices of showering water and blowing breezes and rooms equipped with cascades, should be devised by the physician for the cure of burning due to alcoholism [madatyaya].
159-159½. Painting the body with perfumed cherry, cuscus grass, lodh, fragrant sticky mallow, fragrant poon, cinnamon leaves and nut-grass mixed with the decoction of sandal, is recommended in burning.
160-160½. An application with the lather of jujube sprouts, neem and soap-nut is beneficial in burning.

162-162½. Cold water is recommended for use as affusion, immersion and for wetting the fans to allay burning and thirst.
163-163½. If these procedures are administered in proper dose and in proper time, alcoholism of the Pitta-type gets allayed quickly if the patient strictly carries out the instructions of the physician.
Treatment in Kapha-type
164-166½. Alcoholism [mada-atyaya] of the Kapha-type should be cured by means of emesis and fasting. When thirsty, the patient should be given water boiled with, fragrant sticky mallow or with heart-leaved sida or painted leaved uraria or yellow-berried nightshade or water boiled with all these together and dry ginger, and cooled; or the physician may give water boiled with Cretan prickly clover and nut-grass or with nut-grass and trailing rungia or water boiled with nut-grass alone, as each of these causes the digestion of the morbid humor
167-169. The same is recommended as potion in every kind of alcoholism; This is harmless as a drink and is curative of thirst and fever. Sugar-wine, honey-wine, old medicated wine or Sidhu-wine, mixed with, honey and un-unctuous and demulcent articles added with the pulvis of bishop’s weed and dry ginger, may be given to the patient as potion, when the chyme is digested and he feels thirsty.

173-173½. Meat should be roasted in a dish or an earthen pan till it is completely dry, and then pungent, sour and salt articles should be added; the patient should take honey-wine while eating them.
174-176. In alcoholism [madatyaya] of the Kapha-type, the patient should eat, according to the strength of his gastric fire, at proper meal-time, meat copiously flavoured with black pepper and mixed with juice of pomelo and large measure of pungent articles as well as with bishop’s weed and dry ginger, and acidified with the juice of pomegranate and mixed copiously with pieces of green ginger and rolled up in a hot pancake; he should then take a draught of wholesome wine.
177-178. Take sanchal salt, cumin seeds, kokam butter and Amlavetasa one part each, cinnamon, cardamom and black pepper ½ part each, and mix with one part of sugar. This salt-preparation containing eight ingredients (Aṣṭāṅga) is an excellent promoter of the gastric fire and should be given in alcoholism of the Kapha type, for cleansing the body-channels.
179. The same Ashtanga salt duly diluted with sweet and acid juices, adds relish to articles of wheat and barley and also to meat preparations.
180-181. Reduce into paste, along with spices, white grapes after taking out the seeds, with the juice of pomelo or of pomegranate and add sanchal salt, cardamom, black pepper, cumin seeds, cinnamon bark and bishop’s weed; this chutney mixed with honey, serves as an excellent appetiser and promoter of the gastric fire.
182. A chutney may be prepared out of small grapes too in the same manner; this chutney, mixed with vinegar and liquid gur, acts as a digestive-stimulant and digestive
183-184.

189.The measures which are described in the case of each morbid humor separately, should be given in skilful combination, for the cure of the remaining ten types of tridiscordance, by the wise physician.
190. The physician, who is an expert in pathology as well as in pharmaceutics and knows the science of prognosis as regards curable and incurable diseases, cures all curable diseases.
Beneficial behaviour in Alcoholism [mada-atyaya]
191-193. Lovely woodlands, lakes, ponds full of lotuses, flowers, clean food and drink, cheering companions, garlands, varieties of perfumes, clean garments, musical notes, endearing and delightful company, excellent exposition of stories, humorous anecdotes and songs and the companionship of beloved women act as curatives of alcoholism [madatyaya].
194.Alcohol does not cause morbid intoxication without first agitating the mind, nor without affecting the body. Hence treatment that is mentally cheering and enlivening should be given
Milk course
195. With the above tested remedies, alcoholism gets alleviated; if it does not, then a course of milk-diet should be resorted to, avoiding the use of wine altogether.
196497 Owing to the lightening therapy and the digestive, cleansing and soothing procedures, the patient, who gives up wine, becomes weak and lightened by the reduction of Kapha. For such a patient whose systems have been burnt up by alcohol and whose morbid Vata and Pitta are increased, milk is as wholesome as the rains are for the summer-scorched tree,
198. When the disease has been cured by the administration of milk and the patient has acquired strength, the milk-regimen should be gradually reduced and alcohol substituted little by little.
Complications
199.The person who, after withdrawal from drink-habit, takes again suddenly to drinking excessively succumbs to the disorders named ‘Dhvamsaka’ and ‘Vikshaya’.
200.These two diseases occurring in a person already wasted by disease are the most formidable of all diseases. Their signs and symptoms and treatment will now be described systematically.
201. Excessive discharge of mucus, dryness of throat and mouth, intolerance to sound, excessive torpor, and somnolence should be known to be the symptoms of ‘Dhvamsaka’.
202. Cardiac and throat disorders, stupefaction, vomiting, body-ache, fever, thirst, cough and headache are the signs and symptoms of ‘Vikshaya’.
203. The same medicament is recommended in these conditions as is prescribed in alcoholism [mada-atyaya] of the Vata type, for they occur in emaciated and debilitated persons.
204. Enemata, potion of ghee, courses of milk and ghee, inunction, massage, baths, and food and drink that are curative of Vata should be resorted to.
205. With these procedures ‘Dhvamsaka’ and ‘Vikshaya’ get alleviated. No disorder due to alcohol can occur in a person who takes wine in proper manner.
206. The wise man who abstains from all kinds of intoxicating drink and who has his senses under control, is not afflicted with any disorder due to alcohol either somatic or psychic
Summary
Here are the recapitulatory verses—
207-211. The powers of the goddess of wine, the manner of drinking wine, the articles of which it is prepared, the action of each of them, nature of the combination it demands, how it intoxicates, combined with what qualities it yields excellent result, the nature of intoxication and the three different stages of intoxication and their respective characteristic symptoms, the ill-effects of alcohol as well as its good effects, the three modes of drinking and the signs and symptoms according to the particular type of the mind, the nature of the boon-companions at drinking that makes for happiness, the persons that are intoxicated quickly and those that are intoxicated slowly, the cause of intoxication and its signs and symptoms, how and which wine cures the diseases produced by alcohol and what is the line of treatment—all this is elaborately described in this chapter on the Therapeutics of Alcoholism [madatyaya].
24. Thus, in the Section on Therapeutics, in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the twenty-fourth chapter entitled ‘The Therapeutics of Alcoholism [mada-atyaya-cikitsa]’ is completed.
Etiology
6, The endogenous type is due to internal morbidity of the body and the exogenous type is due to external causes.
7-8. The exogenous wounds [vrana] are caused by trauma, ligature, falls and by injuries resulting from fangs, teeth and nails and also by contact with toxic or poisonous substances or fire or cutting weapons. These exogenous wounds are distinguished from the endogenous variety by the difference in their treatment consisting of charms, talisman, external application etc., by their different causative factors and by their being local affections (affecting the injured region alone).
9 If the wounds [vrana] of the exogenous variety do not yield to the afore-said treatment on account of their association with endogenous morbid factors, the physician should treat them with the medications indicated in the endogenous type of wounds, according to the predominant morbid humor.
10. The three humors—Vata, Pitta and Kapha, being provoked by their respective etiological factors and getting lodged in the external regions, produce ulcers or wounds of the endogenous type.
Symptoms in each type
11. The wounds [vrana] which are indurated hard to the touch, attended with the scanty discharge, acute pain, pricking pain and throbbing, and which are of dusky coloration, are caused by the morbidity of Vata.
12. The physician should treat these wounds [vrana] due to Vata, with impletion therapy, potion of unctuous substances, with sudation and poultices prepared with unctuous substances and with applications and affusions.
13. The physician should know the wound to be due to Pitta if it be attended with thirst, stupefaction, fever, sweat, softening, burning, putrefaction, tissue-destruction, foul smell and discharge.
14. The physician should alleviate these wounds [vrana] of the Pitta-type with applications and affusions prepared with cooling, sweet and bitter drugs, by the potion of medicated ghee as also by purgation.
15. The wound, born of Kapha morbidity, is characterised by very sticky discharge, thickness, greasiness, fixity, slight pain, pale coloration, slight softening and chronicity.
16. The physician should cure the wounds [vrana] of the Kapha-type by means of applications and affusions prepared with astringent, pungent, dry and hot articles as also by lightening therapy and the administration of digestive drugs.
Varieties
17-19. These two varieties of wounds (exogenous and endogenous) are further divided into twenty kinds according to their varying characteristics. As regards these, the clinical examination is conducted in three ways. Excessively morbid conditions are said to be twelve. Their seats of affection are eight. Similarly eight are the pathological odors associated with them, fourteen kinds of discharge are observed in these wounds [vrana]. The complications are sixteen and the morbid factors for the non-healing of these ulcers are twenty-four. Thirty-six are the effective measures laid down in the treatment of these wounds. Listen, as I describe all these separately.
20-21. The operable and the inoperable, putrid and non-putrid, affecting the vital organs and not affecting them, open and closed, hard aud soft, with scanty and profuse discharge, toxic and non-toxic, regular and irregular, with and without deep burrows and pouches (undermined edges), with depressed and elevated surface—thus are described the twenty varieties of wounds [vrana], classified according to their various characteristics.
21½. The method of clinical examination is laid down as of three kinds viz., inspection, interrogation and palpation.
22-23. The examination of age, color, body and sense organs is done by inspection; the examination of etiological factors, the kind of pain, homologation and strength of gastric fire is done by taking the history of the case, by the skilful diagnostician; he should investigate whether there is softness or hardness, coldness or heat in the part by the method of palpation.
24-25. The pale one, the one with depressed edges, the one with greatly thickened edges, the one that is yellowish red, blue or dusky-red in color, the one covered with pustules, the red one, the black one, the very putrid one, the recurrent one and the pin-pointed one, are described as the twelve excessively morbid types of wounds. These morbid conditions are divided by a different mode of classification into twenty-four.
26. Skin, vessels, flesh, fat, bone, sinews, vital parts and the organs in the internal cavities of the body, these eight have been succinctly described as the seats of affection for ulcers and wounds [vrana].
Eight odors
27. The odors of ghee, oil, fat, pus, blood, rust, acid and putridity—these eight kinds of odors are described to emanate from wounds [vrana] by physicians specially versed in the osmology of wounds.
Varieties of discharge
28-28½. The colors of the lymph, serum, pus and blood as also yellow, dusky-red, yellowish red, blue, green, greasy, dry, white and black are regarded to be the fourteen varieties of the color of the discharge from wounds [vrana].
Complications
29-30½. Acute spreading affection, hemiplegia, vascular thrombosis, convulsions, stupefaction, insanity, acute pain in the wound, fever, thirst, lock-jaw, cough, vomiting, diarrhea, hiccup, dyspnea and tremors are the sixteen complications of wounds described by the specialists in the subject of wounds.
31-34. The softening of the sinews, softening of the vessels, deep-seatedness, destruction of tissues by parasites, the presence of sequestrum or foreign bodies, toxic conditions, tendency to spread, constant injury by nails and wood, excessive pressure of the skin and the hair, faulty bandaging, excessive oleation, emaciation due to excessive medication, indigestion, over-eating, antagonistic and unwholesome diet, grief, anger, daysleep, physical exercise, sex-act and neglect of treatment—these are the factors which cause non-healing of wounds in the human body.
35. The excessively morbid wounds become formidable by reason of their excessive discharge, smell, morbidity and complications.
36. The wounds [vrana] that occur in the skin and the flesh, in regions which are easy of approach, which are not associated with complications, which are of recent origin and which occur in favourable seasons and in young and intelligent persons are considered easily curable.
37. When the wound is not characterised by all of the above conditions but is lacking in some, then it is considered formidable; and if all the above conditions are lacking, then the condition should be considered incurable.
Thirty-six curative measures
38-39. In cases of wounds [vrana], the first thing to be done is the administration of cleansing agents which operate on the region nearest to the site of the wounds. Thus, emetics, purgatives, enemata and operative procedure may be used as the situation demands. Once the body has been cleansed of its morbid matter, wounds and ulcers immediately subside. Listen hereafter to the exposition, in their due order, of all the therapeutic measures.
40-43. There are six kinds of operative measures in swelling, compression, refrigeration, henosis, sweating, sedation, probing, the use of cleansing and healing decoctions, applications, use of cleansing and healing oils, leaves, two methods of covering, two methods of bandaging, diet, elevation, two kinds of cauterization (heat and caustic alkali), depression, two kinds of fumigation and application of hardening and softening procedures, dusting of wounds [vrana], restoring the skin pigment, healing and hair-restoring. Thus these thirty-six are regarded as the therapeutic measures in wounds.
Treatment in Edematous wounds [vrana]
44. Knowing that swelling is the premonitory symptom of a wound, the physician should treat it, at the very beginning, by depletion of blood so as to prevent it from terminating in a wound.
45. If there is excessive morbidity, purificatory procedures should be done, and if the morbidity is slight, the patient should be given lightening therapy, and if Vata provocation is predominant, it should first be cured by decoctions and medicated ghees.
46. The application, prepared of the barks of banyan, gular fig, holy fig, wave-leaved fig and country willow, is an excellent refrigerant.
47. The applications of sida, liquorice, milky yam, lotus-tubers, climbling asparagus, blue lily, fragrant poon and sandal act similarly.
48. Powder of roasted paddy, liquorice, ghee and sugar should be made into an application which is good in swelling. The non-irritant foods are a beneficial measure in swelling.
Poultices in swelling
49. If, along these lines of treatment, the swelling does not subside, it should be made to maturate by means of poultices. When it is ripe, opening of it, is said to be beneficial.
50. The poultice, prepared of the powder of roasted grain mixed with ghee or oil, or with both and applied warm, is recommended for the suppuration of swelling.
51. The poultice prepared of the powder of roasted grain mixed with til, linseed, sour curds, yeast, costus and salt, is also recommended.
52. The swelling which is characterised by pain, burning, redness and pricking pain, which feels to touch like a water bag i.e., when pressed it is depressed and on the removal of the pressure it swells again (fluctuation test), should be diagnosed to be a suppurated swelling.
53-54. In case of delicate patients, linseed, gum guggul, milk of thorny milk-hedge, the droppings of cock and pigeon, palas-alkali, yellow thistle and red physic nut are the group of drugs to be used for breaking open the suppurated swelling. In other cases, the operative measure is, indeed regarded as the best treatment.
The six operative Measures
55. Incision, puncturing, excision, scraping, scarification and suturing-these six are the operative measures.
56. Sinuses and fistulas, suppurated swellings, intestinal perforation and obstruction, foreign bodies inside and similar other conditions indicate the operative measure of incision.
57. Ascites, fully suppurated Gulma, and uterine Gulma and diseases due to vitiation of blond such as acute spreading affections, pimples etc., indicate the operative measure of puncturing.
58. Swollen wounds, wounds with thick edges, elevated wounds, hard wounds, excrescent growth of flesh such as piles etc., indicate the operative measure of excision.
59-60½. Leprous lesions and other skin diseases indicating scraping, should be scraped by the intelligent physician. Rheumatic conditions, tumors, pimples, circular red eruptions, various lesions of dermatosis and parts that have suffered injury and swelling indicate the procedure of scarification. Deep opening of the lumbar or the abdominal region indicates suturing. Thus the wise physicians have described the six varieties of operative procedures.
61.The suppurated wounds with narrow opening and capacious interior indicate compression.

Summary
Here are the two recapitulatory verses—
120-121. The two classifications of wounds [vrana], their varieties, examination, morbidity, seats of affection, odors, discharges, complications and line of treatment—these nine topics which were asked to be taught are expounded in brief and in extenso to the intelligent Agnivesha by the sage, in this chapter on Wounds.
25. Thus, in the Section on Therapeutics in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the twenty-fifth chapter entitled ‘The Therapeutics of the two kinds of Wounds [dvivraniya—vrana-cikitsa]’, not being available, the same as restored by Dridhabala, is completed.
Etiology
5 6. By the ingestion of astringent, bitter, pungent and dry articles of diet, by the suppression of the natural urges, by excessive indulgence in eating and sex, the Apana Vata is provoked in the colon; growing strong, it causes obstruction in the lower part of the alimentary tract and produces retention of feces, flatus and urine and thenceforward, gradually, produces very serious disorders of misperistalsis.
Signs and Symptoms
7. Its signs and symptoms are: constant and severe pain in the hypogastric, epigastric, lumbar and the umbilical regions as well as in the back and the hypochondriac regions, distension of the abdomen, nausea, griping pain, pricking pain, indigestion, swellings in the abdomen, and Vata, being obstructed in the rectum, flows upward in the reverse way (reverse peristalsis).
8. The patient passes, with difficulty and after a long delay, dry stools or stools that are thin, dry, rough and cold. There follow the disorders of fever, dysuria, dysentery, gastric disorders and assimilation disorders.
9-10, Also vomiting, blindness, deafness, pain in the head, abdominal affections of Vata type, hard tumor, psychic disorders, thirst; hemothermia, anorexia, Gulma, cough, dyspnea, coryza, partial paralysis and diseases in the hypochondriac region as also many other serious disorders of Vata resulting from misperistalsis occur. O! Agnivesha! listen hereafter as I describe the treatment of these disorders.
Treatment
11. The patient should be anointed with oil used in the treatment of algid fever and then made to undergo sudation in the proper manner, When all the morbid matter has been dissolved he should be treated with suppositories, evacuative or unctuous enemata, unctuous purgatives and given diet that promotes the peristaltic movement.
12. Take one part each of black turpeth, turpeth, long pepper and reel physic nut; ten parts of black gram, one part of indigo plant, and two parts of rock salt. Mix these with gur, rub well in cow’s urine and prepare a suppository of the size of the thumb.
13-15. Or, prepare a suppository of oil-cake, sanchal salt, asafoetida, rape seeds; the three spices and barley-alkali, or of embelia, kamala, clenolepis and milk of thorny milk-hedge plant and mudar, mixed with gur. The suppository may also be prepared of long pepper, rape seed, emetic nut, and kitchen soot, mixed with gur and rubbed in cow’s urine. Or, the physician may insufflate into the rectum through a tube, the powder of black turpeth, emetic nut, bottle gourd and long pepper. Or, the physician, after lubricating the rectum, may insufflate the pulvis of rape seed, bottle gourd, emetic nut, long pepper, bristly luffa and rock-salt. This will regulate the normal peristaltic movement and relieve the retention of feces, flatus and urine.
16-17. If these measures fail, the physician, after subjecting the patient well to oleation and sudation procedures, should give a strong evacuative enema prepared with emetic and purgative drugs, cow’s urine, oil, alkali, acid and other Vata-curative drugs. Tn a condition of the predominance of Vata, the enema should be prepared with acid and oil; in predominance of Pitta, it should be prepared with milk, and in Kapha, with cow’s urine. Such enema quickly relieves the retention of urine, feces and flatus and re-establishes the function of the rectum and the vessels.
18. Leaves of turpeth and thorny milk-hedge plant and til plant etc., should be given as cooked dishes at meals; and barley as staple diet should be given along with the meat-juice of domestic, aquatic and wet-land animals, or with articles which are inducive of the flow of flatus, urine and feces; while the clear top-portion of Sidhu-wine made from gur should be given as post prandial potions.
19. If, again, the patient gets constipated, he should be purged with purgative drugs mixed with cow’s urine, the clear top-portion of wine, whey or vinegar. If, after returning to normal health, he suffers from retention of flatus and feces owing to the dehydrated condition of the body, he should be given unctuous enema.
20. The pulvis of asafoetida, sweet flag, white flowered leadwort, costus, salsod a and embelia, in geometrically progressive doses along with genially warm water, is curative of constipation, pain due to acute gastro-intestinal irritation, gastric disorders, Gulma and misperistalsis.
21. Keeping himself 011 a diet of cooked rice and meat-juice, a person can quickly subdue constipation, and claudication of Vata, by taking the pulvis prepared of sweet flag, chebulic myrobalan white-flowered leadwort, barley-alkali, long pepper, Indian atees and costus, along with warm water.
22.Take asafoetida, root of sweet-flag, bid salt, ginger, cumin seeds, chebulic myrobalan, orris root and costus in arithmetically progressive quantities. The powder prepared of these should be used in splenic disorders, abdominal affections, indigestion and acute gastro-intestinal irritation.
23. Prepare a medicated ghee from 64 tolas of cows ghee, with the decoction of 8 tolas each of the drugs of the tick-trefoil group and 8 tolas of hog’s weed, purging cassia, bonduc, Indian beech and jungle cork tree; this should be given when the movement of Vata is obstructed.
24-25. Take equal parts of fruits and roots described as the purgative group of drugs, asafoetida, roots of decaradices, thorny milk-hedge plant, white-flowered leadwort and hogweed and add to it an equal quantity of the pentad of salts; then triturate and mix them with unctuous substance and cow’s urine and pack in earthen-saucers sealed with earth; then subject them to heating. When that medicated salt is ripe, it should be made into fine powder and taken-along with food or drink. It is curative of constipation and colic.
26. Heart-block, headache, heaviness, retention of eructation, aud coryza, characterising the constipation due to undigested chyme, should be subdued by emesis, starvation and the administration of digestive drugs.
27-29. In Gulma, abdominal disease, inguinal swelling, piles, splenic disorder. disorders of misperistalsis, [? gynecic?] and seminal-disorders, in deep rheumatic conditions associated with vitiation of fat and Kapha, and in sciatica and hemiplegia and other disorders of Vata wherein purgation is indicated, in such conditions, if the course of Vata is obstructed by fat, Kapha. Pitta or blood, it is best to give castor oil mixed with milk, meat-juice or the decoction of the three myrobalans, pulse-soups, cow’s urine or Madira wine, according to the association of the morbid humor.
30-31. On account of its natural Vata-curative action, and on account of its allowing of various combinations and owing to its purgative action, castor oil cures disorders of Vata associated with the vitiation of fat, blood, Pitta and Kapha. Its dose should be upto 20 tolas in the case of patients who are strong and are hard-bowelled and whose morbidity is great, while it should be given mixed with their food in the case of those who are soft-bowelled and of low vitality. Thus has been described the treatment of misperistalsis.
Dysuria
32. There are eight varieties of dysuria afflicting men as a result of excessive physical exertion, strong medications, continual indulgence in dry wine, mounting fast horses, ingestion of the flesh of wet-land creatures and fishes, taking pre-digestion meals, and indigestion.
33. The humors, being provoked by their respective etiological factors individually or all together, and reaching the urinary passages, begin to compress them on all sides. When this occurs, the patient micturates with pain, that Is, there results dysuria.
34. In a condition of provoked Vata, there will be acute pain in the groin, hypogastric region and genitals; and the patient passes frequently Scanty quantities of urine. In a condition of provoked Pitta, the patient passes frequently yellow or reddish trine accompanied with pain and burning, and with difficulty,
35. In a condition of dysuria due to Kapha, there will be heaviness and swelling of the bladder and the phallus, and the patient passes slimy urine. In a condition of dysuria due to tridiscordance, there appear all these symptoms together. This is the most formidable type of dysuria.
36. If the Vata dries up the urine in the bladder along with the semen, Pitta and Kapha, then gradually a calculus is formed, just as a gall-stone is formed from the bile of the cow
37. This calculus is just like a stone and may be of the appearance of either Kadamba flower (mulberry oxalate stone) or it may be a smooth and three layered stone (uric acid stone) or a soft stone (phosphatic stone). If it passes into the urinary passage, it causes obstruction in the passage of urine and produces pain in the course of the urinary tract.
38. It causes pain in the perinium, phallus and hypogastric region and the stream of the urine gets split. Being afflicted with pain, he squeezes the phallus and frequently passes feces and urine.
39. He passes urine mixed with blood if there is ulceration due to the movement of stone, and when the stone passes down, he passes urine easily. This stone, when broken up by Vata, forms sand which passes out through the urinary tract.
40-41. In dysuria which occurs in a man consequent upon his being afflicted with the obstruction of semen, there will be pain in the groin, bladder, phallus, and great and painful enlargement of the testes. He passes urine with difficulty as its flow is obstructed by semen. It is called the cirrhotic condition of the testes This kind of dysuria is said to occur owing to obstruction of semen.
42-42½. If morbid humors, lodged in the urinary tract, separately or together obstruct the passage of semen, there will be pain in the phallus and bladder, and retention of urine and semen. The bladder and testes become indurated, swollen and very painful
43-44. The blood, that is provoked by lesions or trauma or by emaciation, gets lodged and obstructed in the bladder and comes out with the urine causing severe pain; or, if it accumulates much in the bladder, it gets formed into a stone and causes distension and heaviness. When it is discharged, the bladder becomes light. Thus has been described ‘The Pathology of Dysuria’.
45. In the condition of dysuria due to Vata, inunction, unctuous and evacuative enemata, unctuous poultices, urethral douche and affusion prepared with the tick-trefoil group of drugs aud other Vata-curative articles should be administered.
46-47. The mixed unction made of oil, the fat of hog and bear and ghee prepared in the decoction of hogweed, castor, climbing asparagus, coxcomb, white hogweed, heart-leaved sida and Indian rockfoil along with decaradices, horse-gram, jujube and barley, adding the paste of the same drugs and the pentad of salts, when taken in proper dose, quickly subdues painful dysuria due to Vata.
48. These and other effective drugs, ground into powder, are recommended as poultices; also whatever oil-seeds are available should be used, mixed with unctuous and acid articles and in a genially warm condition.
49. Cold affusion, immersion-bath and applications, the cooling summerregimen, enemata, milk, purgation, the juice of grapes, white yam and sugar-cane, and ghee are to be given in the condition of dysuria born of Pitta.

51. The decoction of lotus and blue water-lily, or of water chest-nut or white yam or roots of elephant-grass, prepared in the aforesaid manner, should be taken; or simple cold water may be taken.
52. The seeds of phut cucumber, common cucumber and safflower mixed with saffron and vasaka, taken with grape juice, prove beneficial in the condition of stone, gravel and all kinds of dysuria.
53. The seeds of phut cucumber, liquorice and deodar should be taken with rice water, in the condition of dysuria of Pitta-type. Similarly, Indian berberry should be taken with the juice of emblic myrobalan and honey in dysuria of the Pitta-type.
54. Alkali, hot and acute drugs, eats and drinks, sudation, barleydiet, emesis and evacuative enemata, potion ot butter-milk, inunction and potion of oil medicated with bitter drugs—these are beneficial in dysuria of the Kapha-type.
55. In the condition of dysuria of Kapha type, the three spices, small caltrops, cardamom and the bones of Sarasa bird, each taken ½ tola and mixed, with honey and cow’s urine, may betaken; or, cardamom mixed with honey and the juice of plaintain or curry-neem may be taken.

57. Dita bark, purging cassia, Kebuka, cardamom, crane-tree, Indian beech, kurchi seeds and guduch are to be decocted in water and a gruel prepared in it and taken; or the decoction may be taken mixed with honey.
58. In conditions of tridiscordance where all the three humors are equally provoked, the treatment of Vata should be undertaken first. If the Kapha is the predominant humor, emesis should be undertaken first, and if Pitta, purgation; and if the Vata is predominant, enema should be administered. Thus has been described ‘The therapeutics of Dysuria’.
59. In the condition of stone or gravel in the urinary tract the treatment indicated in the condition of dysuria due to Kapha and Vata is beneficial. Hear now the successful method of treatment for the dissolution and expulsion of the stone in the urinary tract.

67. The roots of drumstick tree, mace into paste with cold water and taken, act beneficially in the condition of stone and gravel in the urinary tract. White sugar candy and barley alkali mixed in equal parts is a remedy for all varieties of dysuria.
68. Having quaffed wholesome wine, the patient should ride a chariot or a horse at great speed. Then the calculus or gravel slips down and is expelled. Otherwise, the surgeon should remove it by operative measure.
69-70½. In dysuria born of the seminal obstruction, the treatment should be carried out after proper investigation of the condition. Take the roots of cotton plant, vasaka, Indian rock-foil, heart leaved sida, ticktrefoil group of drugs and job’s tears, white hogweed, Aindri, hog’s weed, climbing asparagus, guduch, mussel-shell creeper and prepare a decoction.

76. Exercise, suppression of natural urges dried and un-unctuous articles, pastry, exposure to wind and sun, sex-act, dates, lotus-rhizomes wood apple, jambul, lotus-stalk am articles of astringent taste are to be avoided by the patient. Thus has been described ‘The treatment of the calculus’.
77-80. Excessive exertion, excessive use of irritant articles, purgation and enema, excessive worry, fear, agitation and improper treatment of diseases emesis, indigestion, suppression of urges and emaciation—all these are causative factors of cardiac disorders Even so is trauma. Discoloration, fainting, fever, cough, hiccup, dyspnea, bad taste in the mouth, thirst, stupe faction, vomiting, nausea, pain and anorexia—these and various other conditions are born of cardiac disorder. In cardiac disorder of the Vata type, there will be a sense of emptiness in the heart, tachycardia, emaciation, breaking pain, heart-block and stupefaction.

Etiology and Symptoms of Rhinitis
104-106½. The suppression of natural urges, indigestion, inhalation of dust, excessive speech, anger, abnormality of season, affliction of the head, excessive waking, excessive sleep, very cold water, frost, excessive sexual indulgence, weeping and smoking are the factors by which in a condition where the morbid humor is in a congealed state in the head, the Vata gets increased and gives rise to coryza. There will be pain and pricking sensation in the nose, sternutation, watery discharge and affection of the voice and the head due to Vata; inflammation of the tip of the nose, fever, dryness of mouth, thirst, and hot and yellow discharge from the nose, in a condition due to Pitta; and cough, anorexia, thick and profuse discharge, heaviness and itching in the nasal passage occur in a condition due to Kapha. All the symptoms occur with acute pain and great discomfort in rhinitis due to tridiscordance type
Pernicious Rhinitis
107-109. All kinds of rhinitis described above, if aggravated by unwholesome diet or neglect, will develop into a pernicious type of rhinitis. Then, it will give rise to various disorders of sternutation, atrophic rhinitis, nasal obstruction, nasal catarrh, ozena, chronic rhinitis, suppurative rhinitis, ed ematous rhinitis, nasal growth, sanguinous purulent rhinitis, furunculosis, the disorders of the head, ear and eye, alopecia, tawniness or greyness of the hair, thirst, dyspnea, cough, fever, hemothermia, alteration of the voice and consumption.

111. The Vata, affecting the vital organs [marma] in the head and getting lodged in its passages causes sternutation, The Vata, getting provoked, dries up the Kapha and causes atrophy of the turbinated bones and loss of smell (atrophic rhinitis).
112. It should be known as nasal obstruction, when the Kapha with Vata obstructs the channels of breathing. That is the condition of nasal catarrh where there is thick yellow and ripe discharge from the head or brain.
Diseases of the Nose
113-114. Due to neglect, there develop discoloration, stinking, swelling and giddiness; this condition is called ‘ozena’. Where there is obstruction, drying, softening or fuming in the nose, the person is not able to recognise smell or taste, he should be known to be affected with rhinitis. It should be regarded as disorder due to Vata-cum-Kapha if its symptoms are like those of acute rhinitis.
115-115½. The inflammation of the nose, due to vitiation of blood and Pitta, will cause burning, redness, swelling and suppuration. The morbid humor, vitiating the blood and some other tissues of the nasal region causes swelling in the nose; and as a result of the vitiation of flesh and blood, there will form nasal growths which cause obstruction to breathing.
116. There will be discharge from the nose, ear, or the mouth, of blood, tinged yellow with the color of Pitta. This is called sanguinous purulent rhinitis.
117. The Vata combined with Pitta, vitiating the skin and the superficial tissues causes furunculosis which suppurates. They call that condition red-nose, the condition where a man’s nose is shining bright and red like fire. Thus has been described the pathology of diseases of the Nose.

And in the diseases of mouth due to Kapha, there will be itching, heaviness, pallor, sliminess, unctuousness, anorexia, dullness, increase of mucus, ptyalism, nausea, weakness of the gastric fire, torpor and dull pain.
122. If all these symptoms appear together, then it is to be regarded as mouth-disease due to tridiscordance. These diseases of the mouth are sixty-four in number when designated according to seats of affection, susceptible body-tissues and shape-
123. In the treatise dealing with the special branch of Shalakya-tantra, are described the etiology, signs and symptoms, shape and treatment of these disorders in full- I shall describe the treatment of only four main types of mouth-diseases, in their relevant situations in this treatise.

290. In laryngeal disorders due to tridiscordance, all the remedies described are beneficial except blood-letting. This is, in brief, the treatment of laryngeal disorders. Thus has been described ‘The treatment of laryngeal disorders.’
Here are verses again—
291.The Vata, Pitta and Kapha in men are located in the pelvic region, stomach region and head region respectively. Hence, emesis etc. must be prescribed as is suitable to the regions near to the affected part.
292. The sentient world i.e. life is either maintained or afflicted by the Vata and other humors even as the world is, by the wind, sun and moon respectively, both in their normal, as well as their morbid states.
293. These humors never destroy one another though possessed of antagonistic qualities, because of their mutual natural homologation even as virulent poison does not destroy the snakes.
Summary
Here is the recapitulatory verse—
294. The etiology, signs and symptoms and the therapeutics of the diseases of the three vital regions [tri-marma] have been described individually and elaborately in this chapter on ‘The Therapeutics of the Affections of the Three Vital Regions’.
26. Thus, in the Section on Therapeutics in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the twenty-sixth chapter entitled ‘The Therapeutics of the Affections of the Three Vital Regions [tri-marma-cikitsa]’ not being available, the same as restored by Dridhabala, is completed.
Etiology and onset
8-11. By taking unctuous, hot, light and cold articles; by eating pre-digestion meals or promiscuous diet; by ingesting continually liquid and dried articles, curds, milk and flesh of domestic, wet-land and aquatic creatures; by taking articles of pastry and stale wine; by over-much day-sleep and night vigils; by starvation; by eating on a loaded stomach; by over exertion fear and suppression of the natural urges, and by excessive use of unctuous articles, the chyme becomes accumulated in the alimentary system and combining with the fat, obstructs the functions of the Vata and other humors; and by reason of its heaviness, quickly goes down and settles in the thighs, through the downward carrying vessels; and the morbid humor, excessively provoked by the fat, fills up the hip, thigh and calf region! and causes uncontrollable tremors and weakness of muscular movement.
12. As water lies motionless in a large, deep and still lake, so does the Kapha, which has settled in the thighs, lie firm, unagitated and motionless.
13. Then the symptoms of heaviness, fatigue, contraction, burning, pain, anesthesia, tremor, breaking pain, throbbing and pricking pain develop and take away the patient’s life.
14. The Kapha combined with the fat overpowers the Vata and Pitta, and produces spasticity of the thighs by its qualities of firmness and coldness; hence the disease is called Urustambha [ūrustambha] or spastic condition of the thigh i.e., spastic paraplegia [uru-stambha].
Symptoms
15. Its premonitory symptoms are—self-absorption, somnolence, excessive immobility, anorexia, fever, horripilation, vomiting and asthenia of the muscles of the thigh and the calf.
16. The physician, mistaking this to be a condition of the morbidity of Vata, may treat it with the unctuous therapy. As a result, the symptoms of the disease will be aggravated and the patient develops asthenia and anesthesia of the lower extremeties; he lifts the feet with difficulty.
17. There is marked exhaustion of the muscles of the calf and the thigh, continuous burning and pain; the patient feels pain on putting his feet on the ground and he does not feel the sensation of cold contacts.
18. He has no control over the functions of standing, pressing, moving or walking; he feels as if his feet and thighs are broken and are being propelled by some one else,
19. If the patient is further afflicted with burning, pricking pain, and tremors, the condition, of spastic paraplegia [urustambha] will lead to the patient’s death. The condition where the above symptoms are not developed and is of recent origin, is curable.
Contra-indications
20. The oleation treatment should not be given to such a patient nor enema, nor purgation, nor even emesis. Hear the reasons why I forbid these measures.
21. Oleation and unctuous enemata always lead to increase of Kapha, while purgation will not be able to eliminate the Kapha which is localised in the affected region.
22. Emesis can remove with ease only Kapha or Pitta that has become lodged in the habitat of the Kapha. Purgation can remove both the above humors, only if they are lodged in the stomach.
23. But enemata may radically eliminate all the three humors if they are lying in the colon. But the morbidity which has settled and become fixed in the thighs by a combination of the chyme and fat cannot be eliminated by any of these methods.
24. Owing to the quality of coldness of the seat of Vata, the chyme and the fat, which have gone there and become fixed, cannot be easily eliminated, just as it is difficult to lift up water from a deep pit.
25. The physician, guided by reason, should continually carry out the sedation, elimination and dehydration of the excessive accumulations of Kapha and chyme.
Dehydration procedure
26-27. For carrying out the dehydration procedure, the patient should be continually given the diet of barley, sanwa millet and common millet along with vegetables prepared with water and oil but without adding salt, or with sprouts of marsilia plant, neem, mudar, country willow, purging cassia, black nightshade and white goose foot or bitter group of drugs, such as carilia fruit etc.
28. Or, he may be given courses of alkali or medicated wines or chebulic myrobalans or a course of honey and water or of long pepper. All these preparations are curative of spastic paraplegia [uru-stambha].
29-29½. The patient may also take sensitive plant, gum of silk cotton and bael, with honey; or pine resin, fragrant sticky mallow, deodar, Indian valerian, sandal, fulsee flower, costus, Himalayan silver fir and nardus, with honey.
30-32½. (1) Nut-grass, chebulic myrobalan, lodh, Himalayan cherry, kurroa; (2) Deodar, turmeric, Indian berberry, sweet flag and kurroa; (3) Roots of long pepper, long pepper, pine and deodar; (4) Chaba pepper, roots of white flowered leadwort, deodar and chebulic myrobalan; (5) Marking nut, long pepper and roots of long pepper; the paste of the drugs described in each of these hemistichs may be given mixed with honey for the cure of spastic paraplegia [urustambha].
33-34½. Equal parts of the powders of jequirity, emetic nut, red physic nut, seeds of kurchi, sweet flag, trilobed virgin's bower, purging cassia, Patha, Indian beech and carilia fruit should be given as potion mixed with honey or dissolved in water or with whey and honey, as a cure for spastic paraplegia [uru-stambha].
35-35½. Trilobed virgins bower, atees, white flowered leadwort and kurroa, should be given as potion as before. Similarly, the patient may take as potion gum guggul immersed in cow's urine during night.
36-37. The powders of yellow milk plant, atees, Indian toothache tree, sweet flag, deodar, white flowered leadwort, cuscus, Patha and kurroa, mixed with honey should be given as a linctus; or it should be given dissolved in water along with honey.
38-38½. Or, the patient may drink the paste of banyan bark, shell and fragrant poon, mixed with honey. The patient, suffering from spastic paraplegia [urustambha], may take a linctus of the powders of the three myrobalans, long pepper, nut-grass, ch aba pepper and kurroa mixed with honey.
39-39½ If there are morbid symptoms of excessive depletion, he should be gradually given impletive treatment consisting of the meats of Jangala animals and old Shali rice.
40-40½. If owing to excess of dry treatment, there is provocation of Vata preceded by insomnia and pain, the patient should be treated with those procedures and sudation which are curative of Vata.
41-42. The medicated oil prepared with trilobed virgin’s bower, milky yam, Indian groundsel, small caltrops, sweet flag, long leaved pine, eaglewood and Patha, and mixed with 8 tolas of honey, should be given to the patient as potion in the dosage of 16 tolas.
43-44. The medicated oil made from rape-seed oil prepared with the paste of costus, pine-resin, fragrant sticky mallow, long leaved pine, deodar, fragrant poon, wild carrot and winter cherry, should be given, mixed with honey in proper dosage, to the patient suffering from spastic paraplegia. Thus, when the dryness is removed, the patient gets cured of spastic paraplegia [uru-stambha].
45-46. The medicated oil prepared with 8 tolas of rock salt, 20 tolas of dry ginger, 8 tolas of roots of long pepper, 9 tolas of white flowered leadwort, 20 marking-nut stones, added to 64 tolas of til and 512 tolas of sour gruel is procreant and is curative of sciatica, spastic paraplegia [urustambha], painful piles and all the diseases due to Vata-provocation.
47. The medicated oil, prepared with 8 tolas of each of roots of long pepper and dry ginger added to 64 tolas of til oil and 512 tolas of buttermilk, is curative of sciatica and spastic paraplegia. Thus has been described ‘The oil called the medicated Eightfold Butter-milk Oil’.
48.Thus, the medicaments for internal administration for the patient afflicted with spastic paraplegia [uru-stambha], have been described; now listen to a description of the external treatment which helps to diminish Kapha.
External Measures
49-51½. The physician should prescribe frequent massage with the earth of the ant-hills, the powdered root, fruit and bark of Indian beech and powdered brick. Or with the roots of winter cherry, mudar, neem or of deodar; any one of these should be mixed with honey, rape-seed and the earth of ant-hills, and prescribed for strong massage in the treatment of spastic paraplegia. The paste prepared by pounding together red physic nut, physic nut, holy basil and rape-seed, should be given as application to the patient afflicted with spastic paraplegia [urustambha] by the wise physician.
52-52½. The warm decoction made of the leaves, roots and fruits of common sesbane, drumstick, holy basil, dry ginger, kurchi and neem should be given for affusion of the affected part.
53. The paste, made of rape-seeds pounded with cow’s urine and kept overnight, should be used as application.
54-55. The physician, conversant with the line of treatment, may give an application to the affected part, with the paste of kurchi, holy basil, costus, fragrant group of drugs, Indian toothache, drumstick, Indian nightshade, mudar-roots, the earth of anthills and shrubby basil, pounded along with curds and rock salt for the cure of spastic paraplegia.

58. To reduce Kapha, exercise, whenever possible, should be prescribed; or the patient may be made to walk on uneven ground covered with gravel and sand.
59-59½. The patient may swim frequently against the current of a river flowing with cold and wholesome water, or in a pond having cold and still waters. Thus, when the Kapha is dried up, spastic paraplegia [urustambha] is cured.
60-61. All the remedies which are depletive of Kapha and nonprovocative of Vata should be prescribed always as a remedy for spastic paraplegia; and the line of treatment should be such as to protect the body-vitality and the gastric fire.
Summary
Here is a recapitulatory verse—
62. In this chapter on the therapeutics of spastic paraplegia [urustambha], the etiology, premonitory symptoms, the signs and symptoms; the cause for the contra-indication of the quinary purificatory procedures and the two effective lines of treatment are described.
27. Thus, in the Section on Therapeutics in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the twenty-seventh chapter entitled ‘The Therapeutics of Spastic Paraplegia [uru-stambha-cikitsa]’, not being available, the same as restored by Dridhabala, is completed.
Etietogy
15-18½. By a diet that is dry, cold, scanty and light, by sexual excess, excessive waking and wrongful treatment, by the excessive loss of waste-matter or blood, by excessive starvation, swimming, way-faring, exercise and other excessive activity, by the loss of body-elements, by excessive emaciation due to worry, grief and disease, by habitual use of uncomfortable beds and seats, by auger, day-sleep, fear, suppression of the natural urges, chyme-disorder, trauma and abstention from food, by injury to vital parts, by riding on or falling off an elephant, camel, horse or other swift-running animal or conveyance—by these factors the Vata getting aggravated fills up the vacuities in the body-passages and produces various kinds of disorders which affect the whole body or which get localised in a single region.
19-19½. The first indistinct manifestations of a disease are said to be the premonitory symptoms; the symptoms are the actual or distinct manifestations of a disease, while its cure is characterized by the diminution of the symptoms.
Signs and Symptoms
20-23½. Contraction, stiffness of joints, aching pain in bones and joints, horripilation, garrulousness, spasticity of the hands, back and head; lameness of hands and feet, hunch-back, atrophy of the limbs; insomnia; destruction of fertility, fetus and menses; tremors, anesthesia and paralysis of limbs; ticks of the muscles of the head, nose, eyes, shoulder, girdle and neck; splitting pain, pricking pain, agony, convulsions, delusion and fatigue; such are the general symptoms which the provoked Vata manifests. On account of the difference in the etiological factors and in the seats of affection, it produces the specific characteristics of each disease.
24-24½. If the Vata located in the abdomen, becomes vitiated, there occur retention of urine and feces, disorders of the inguinal and epigastric regions, Gulma, piles and pleurodynea.
25-25½. If the Vata pervading the entire body is provoked, there occur body tremors and breaking pain and the patient will be afflicted with all sorts of pains and with a feeling as if his joints are falling asunder.
26 26½, If the Vata located in the rectal region is provoked, there occur the retention of feces, urine and flatus, colic, flatulence, formation of sand and stone, pain and atrophy in the region of the calves, thighs, pelvis and the back.
27-27½. If the Vata located in the stomach is provoked, there occur pain in the regions of the pericardia, umbilicus, sides and the stomach, thirst, eructations and acute gastro-intestinal irritation, cough, parching of the throat and mouth, and dyspnea,
28-29. If the Vata located in the colon is provoked, there occur gurglings colic, meteorism, difficulty in micturition and defecation, constipation and pain in the pelvic region. The Vata provoked in the sense-organs, such as the ears etc., impairs or destroys the sensory functions.
30. If the Vata pervading the skin gets provoked, the skin gets dry, fissured, numb, shrivelled and black, and feels pricking sensation. It becomes stretched and reddened and there occurs pain in the joints.
31. If the Vata located in the blood gets provoked, there occur acute pain, burning, discoloration, emaciation, anorexia, rashes on the body, and spasticity of limbs after meals.
32. If the Vata located in the flesh and fat gets provoked, there occur heaviness of the body, severe aches as if the body had been beaten with a cudgel or fist cuffs, pain and extreme exhaustion.
33. If the Vata located in the bone and bone-marrow gets provoked, there occur breaking pain in the fat, bones and joints, arthralgia, loss of flesh and strength, loss of sleep and constant pain.
34. If the Vata located in the secretory system is provoked, there occur either the premature expulsion or undue retention of the semen or of the fetus, or causes deformity of the fetal body.
35. If the Vata located In the sinews is provoked, there occur the opisthotonous and emprosthotonous conditions, pain in the extremities, hunch-back and general or local disorders.
36. If the Vata located in the vessels is provoked, there occur mild pain and edema all over the body, atrophy, throbbing, loss of pulsation and contraction or dilatation of the vessels.
37. If the Vata located in the joints is provoked, there occur the swelling of the joints which feel on palpation as if they were bags inflated with air and the movements of extension and flexion are accompanied with pain. (Thus have been described the signs and symptoms of morbid Vāta, classified according to the various parts of the body).
Facial Paralysis
38-39. If the excessively increased Vata affects one half of the body, it diminishes the blood in the arms, feet and knees and causes contraction of these parts. It causes distortion of one side of the face and produces asymmetry of the nose, eye-brow, forehead, eye and jaw.
40-42. The food, instead of going straight, goes into one side of the south. While speaking the nose gets curved, the eyes remain rigid and winkless and the sneeze gets suppressed His speech is faint, distorted, stuttery, indistinct and thick. His teeth get shaky; there is pain in his ears and his voice is broken; there is pain in his feet, hands, eyes, calves, thighs, temples, ears and cheeks. This condition, whether it occurs in association with paralysis of half the body or occurs by itself, that is, affecting the face only, is called facial paralysis.
Antarayama
43. If that Vata, getting localised in the side of the neck, spreads into the internal channels, it will cause spasticity of the neck. It is called Antarayama (emprosthotonous condition).
44-44¾. The upper and lower part of the neck becomes flexed and very stiff, the teeth become clenched, there is salivation, contraction of the back-muscles and spasm of the muscles of the head, pendiculation and lock-jaw; these are the symptoms of ‘Antarayama [antarāyāma]’ (emprosthotonous condition).
Bahirayama
45-46. ‘Bahirayama [bahirāyāma]’ i.e., opisthotonous condition, will now be described. The strongly provoked Vata, getting localised in the back and the sides of the neck and constricting the external vessels, causes bow-like rigidity of the body which condition is called Bahirayama or opisthotonous condition.
47-48. The body being bent like a bow, the head gets retracted almost touching the back and the chest is thrown forward, the sides of the neck become rigid and there is squeezing pain in the neck and clenching of teeth, salivation and aphasia. This attack either kills the patient or causes deformity.
Lock-jaw
49-49½. The Vata, when it gets localised at the root of the jaws, it produces the condition of a gaping mouth or a painless stiff condition where the mouth cannot be closed. By causing spasticity of the jaw, it produces a condition of lock-jaw, where the mouth becomes fixed and cannot be opened.
Aksepaka
50-50½. That condition is called Akshepaka [ākṣepaka] or spasmodic contraction, where the muscles of the hands and feet together with vessels, sinews and tendons, cause frequent spasmodic contractions.
Danda
51-51½. That is called staff-like rigidity or tonic contraction of the muscles, where the Vata causes tonic rigidity of muscles of the hands, feet, head, back and hips, so that the body becomes as rigid as a staff (Daṇḍa [daṇḍa]). This condition is irremediable.
52-52½. When the force of the paroxysm is gone in the above condition, the patient returns to normal. If the paroxysm does not leave, the patient gets afflicted with pain and other characteristics peculiar to the lesions. Physicians should regard this condition as incurable
Hemiplegia
53-55. That condition is called hemiplegia or paralysis of one side of the body, where the morbid Vata seizing the vessels, controlling the function of the body and constricting the sinews, afflicts the right or the left half of the body, producing loss of movement, pain and loss of speech. That conditon is to be known as the lesion of one limb ‘Monoplegia’ where a single hand or root gets contracted and afflicted with aching and pricking pain, and that condition is called the lesion of the whole body where the entire body is affected.
Sciatica
56-56½. That condition is said to be Sciatica, where first the hip and then the waist, back, thigh, knee and calf are gradually affected with stiffness, pain and pricking sensations and associated with frequent twitching
due to Vata. If this condition is due to Vata and Kapha combined, there will be additional symptoms of torpor, heaviness and anorexia.
Khalli
57. That condition is known as Khalli where there is kneading (neuralgic) pain referable to feet, calf, thigh and shoulder.
58- The rest of the disorders should be diagnosed according to the symptoms characteristic of the seat of affection. In all these disorders, one should diagnose the condition of the association of Pitta and other morbid elements
Occlusion
59-60½. The provocation of Vata is due to diminution of body-elements or due to obstruction to its normal circulation caused by occlusion in the body-channels. The Vata, Pitta and Kapha circulate through all the body-channels and spaces. The Vata, on account of its quality of subtleness, is really the impeller of the other two humors. When the Vata is provoked, it agitates the other two humors and throwing them about here and there, causes occlusion of the body channels, thereby producing disorders. It also leads to the diminution of the body-nutrient fluid and other bodyelements.
61-61½. When the Vata is occluded by Pitta the following symptoms are observed—burning, thirst, colic giddiness, darkness of vision heart-burn on eating pungent, acid, salt and hot things and craving for cold things.
62-62½. If the Vata is occluded by Kapha, there will be cold, heaviness, colic, pronounced homologation to pungent and similar other articles, craving for fasting, exertion and dry and hot things.
63-63½. If it is occluded in the blood, there will be severe burning pain in the area between the skin and the flesh, and there will be edema with reddish tinge and rashes.
64-64½. When the Vata is occluded in the flesh, there will appear hard pigmented pimples and swellings, horripilation and formication.
65-65½. When the Vata is occluded in the adipose tissue, there will be produced local swellings that are movable, smooth, soft and cold, as well as anorexia. This condition is known as a rheumatic condition and is difficult of cure.
66-66½. When the Pitta is occluded in the osseous tissue, the patient likes warmth and pressure; and he becomes exhausted, experiences splitting pain and feels as though his body is being pricked with needles.
67-671. When the Vata is occluded in the marrow, there will occur flexure of the body, pendiculation, girdle-pain and colicky pain; on being pressed with the hand the patient gets relief.
68.If the Vata is occluded in the seminal passages, there results either no discharge of semen or too hurried discharge of it or a sterile condition of the semen.
68½. If the Vata is occluded by food, there will be pain in the stomach on ingestion of food and disappearance of pain at the end of digestion.
69. If the Vata is occluded by urine, there occurs retention of urine and distension of bladder.
70-71½. If the Vata is occluded by the fecal matter, there occurs absolute retention of feces in its own habitat i.e., in the lower part of the colon, and there will be griping pain in that region; and whatever unctuous matter is ingested, is immediately digested; and on ingestion of food, the person suffers from increased distension of the abdomen, and owing to the pressure of the food ingested, the patient passes dry feces with difficulty and after long delay. He is afflicted with pain in the hips, groins and back, and the Vata moves in a reverse direction (i.e., there is misperistalsis); there is also disturbance of the cardiac action.
72-74. Dislocation, lock-jaw, contracture, hunch-back, facial paralysis, hemiplegia, atrophy of a part, paraplegia, arthritis, stiffness, rheumatic conditions and disorders due to occlusion of Vata in the marrow; these, on account of their deep-seated nature, may or may not be cured even after careful treatment. The physician should endeavour to cure such of these conditions as occur in strong persons and as are of recent origin and unassociated with any complications.
Treatment
75-77¼. Now listen to the exposition of the line of treatment of the diseases due to the provocation of Vata. If there is a simple provocation of Vata without any kind of occlusion, it should be treated at first with oral administration of unctuous preparations such as ghee, fat, oil and marrow. The person, when over-strained by the oleation therapy, should be comforted by rest for a while and should again be oleated with milk or thin gruels and meat-juices of domestic, wet-land and aquatic animals, mixed with unctuous articles or with milkpudding, or kedgeree mixed with acid and salt articles and then should be given unctuous enemata, nasal medications and demulcent food,
Sudation therapy
78-78½. When he is well oleated, he should be subjected to sudation therapy and should be given sudation treatment as required, after he has been well inuncted with the kettle-sudation and mixed steam kettle sudation and such other varieties of sudation-processes in which unctuous articles have been used,
79-79½. With the aid of oleation and sudation procedures, even a distorted and the stiffened limb can be slowly brought back to normality, just as it is possible to bend, according to one’s desire, even a dried piece of wood by such measures.
80-80½. Horripilation, pricking pain, aches, extensive swelling, stiffness and spasticity and similar other conditions can be quickly cured and the softness of the part restored by means of sudation.
Oleation therapy
81-81½. And the oleation therapy, when applied quickly, replenishes the diminished body-elements and increases the vitality, strength of the gastric fire, robustness and the life-span,
82-82½. The oleation and sudation procedures should be repeatedly administered in order that the disorders of Vata may not stay in the viscera softened by oleation procedure.
Purgation
83-83½. If, due to excessive morbidity, the humors do not subside with the above procedure, the patient should then be cleansed by means of mild drugs mixed with unctuous articles.
84-84½. For this purpose the patient may take the medicated ghee prepared with Tilwaka or round milk-hedge, or he may take castor oil with milk; these are beneficial and expel the morbid humors.
85-85½. By excessive use of unctuous, acid, saltish and hot articles of diet, the excretory matter gets accumulated and occluding the alimentary passage, obstructs the Vata; hence, the normal peristaltic movement of Vata should be stimulated to expel it.
Enema
86-86½. The patient, who is debilitated and as a consequence, in whom purgation is contra-indicated, should be given evacuative enema followed by a diet consisting of or mixed with, the drugs of the digestive and digestive-stimulant groups.
87. Sudation and oleation procedures, repeated again, are beneficial for those whose gastric fire has got stimulated as a result of the purificatory procedure.
88-88½. All diseases due to Vata-provocation are always to be continually treated with sweet, acid, saltish and unctuous articles of diet, nasal errhines and inhalations Thus has the treatment of diseases due to Vata-provocation been expounded in general.
89-89½. Now will be described the treatment of particular disorders. In the condition of morbid Vata lodged in the alimentary tract, the patient should drink alkali mixed with drugs of the digestive and digestive-stimulant groups and of the acid group, for helping the digestion of the undigested matter.
90. In condition of morbid Vata lodged in the rectum or the colon, the treatment curative of misperistalsis should be given.
90½. If it is lodged in the stomach, the treatment curative of the particular aspect of morbidity should be given after the purificatory process.
91. When the Vata is provoked in the entire body, inunction, evacuative enemata and unctuous enemata should be given.
91½. And when the skin is affected, sudation, inunction and bath as also cordial food should be given.
92. When the blood is affected, cold applications, purgation and venesection are good.
92½. And if the flesh is affected, purgation, evacuative enemata aud sedation therapy should be administered.
93. If the osseous tissues or bone-marrow is affected, it should be treated with internal an 1 external election therapy.
94. If the semen is affected, virilific eats and drinks or drugs promotive of strength and semen are beneficial. If the passage of semen is found to be occluded, purgation should be administered.
94½. Only after purgation and ingestion of diet, the aforesaid line of treatment should be carried out.
95-95½. If the fetus or a child is emaciated by Vata-provocation, milk prepared with sugar, white teak aud liquorice is beneficial in rehabilitation.
96. If the provoked Vata is located in the cardiac region, the milk prepared of ticktrefoil is beneficial.
96½. And if it is located in the umbilicus, fish prepared with unripe bael fruits should be given,
97-97½. If there are cramps in any part of the body, poultice should be applied, and if any part of the body is contracted, inunction with the medicated oil prepared with black grain and rock salt should be prescribed.
98-98½. If there is Vata provocation in the arm or head, nasal errhine should be given and a postprandial potion of oily preparations; and if the morbid Vata is localised below the umbilical region, enemata and pre-prandial potion of ghee are recommended.
99-99½. In facial paralysis, inunction and anointing the head with medicated oil, impletive diet, kettle-sudation and poultices prepared of the flesh of aquatic animals are beneficial.
100. In hemiplegia, sudation with unctuous preparations and purgation are beneficial.
100-100¾. In sciatica, venesection of the vein situated between Kandara [kaṇḍarā] (tendo-calcaneus) and Gulpha (Malleolus), enemata and cauterization should be resorted to.
101-101½. In Khalli [khallī], hot poultices prepared with milk pudding or kedgeree ot flesh mixed with oil and ghee are beneficial.
102-103. In a case of fixed gaping mouth, the right way of correcting the condition is as follows:—The jaw should be subjected to sudation procedure first and then it should be pressed downwards by the thumbs (inserting in the mouth and pressing on the molar teeth) and pushed upwards by the fingers (which are placed externally below the chin). In a condition of sub-luxation, it should be made to go to its proper position; and in a condition of fixity, it should be subjected to sudation procedure and flexed.
103½. Each case should be given special treatment according to the particular seat of affection, the particular body-element affected and such other factors.
104-105½. Ghee, oil, fat, marrow, affusion, inunction, enemata, oleation, sudation, resort to windless places, covering with blankets, use of meat-juices, medicated milks, articles of diet of sweet, acid and salt tastes and whatever things are roborant, are beneficial for the patient afflicted with the disorders due to morbid Vata.

180. And the medicated oils which will be described (in the next chapter) in the therapeutics of rheumatic conditions, may be prescribed for the alleviation of Vata-disorders, by the physician desirous of success in treatment.
Oil as Specific in Vata
181-182. There exists no medication superior to oil as a remedy for Vata. Owing to its qualities of diffusiveness, heat, heaviness and unctuousness and by virtue of its becoming more powerful on being medicated with the Vata-curative group of drugs and being also capable of still further intensification of potency i.e. dynamization, by being cooked over and over again for hundreds or thousands of times, it very quickly cures the diseases which have pervaded into even the minutest part of the body,
183. This general line of treatment is also recommended in conditions of association with morbidity of other humors but more especially when the body-channels have been occluded by Pitta and Kapha, in Vata-disorders.
Treatment in occasions
184-185. In condition of occlusion of Pitta, the physician should administer cold and hot lines of treatment in alternation: the medicated life-promoter ghee is recommended; the patient should be given the flesh-diet of Jangala creatures, barley and Shali rice; he should be given Yapana-enemata,milk enemata. purgation, potion of milk and decoction of pentaradices and sida.
186. He should be given affusion with the medicated oil or ghee or milk prepared with liquorice and sida, or with the decoction of pentaradices, or with cold water.
187-1874 In condition of occlusion by Kapha, he should be given as diet, articles made of barley and the flesh of Jangala beasts and birds. He should be given a strong dose of sudation, evacuative enema and emesis along with purgation. Cold ghee, til oil and rape seed oil are beneficial.
188. In the condition of occlusion by both Kapha and Pitta, Pitta must first be subdued.
189-189½. On finding that Kapha is located in the stomach, emesis should be given and if it be located in the colon, purgation should be given, and if Pitta has pervaded the entire system, purgation should be given.
190-190½. If morbid Kapha is liquefied by the sudation and flows down and accumulates in the colon, or the symptoms of Pitta become manifest, both of these morbid elements should be eliminated by means of enemata.
191-192. If Vata is associated with Kapha, it should be eliminated by warm evacuative enema mixed with cow’s urine. If Vata is associated with Pitta, it should be eliminated by evacuative enema mixed with milk. Then the patient should be given unctuous enema, prepared with the sweet group of drugs.
192½. In condition of Vata located in the head and associated with Kapha, inhalation and nasal medication should be given.
193-193½. If after the elimination of Pitta and Kapha, there remains any residual morbidity of Vata in the channels of the chest-region (respiratory channels), the treatment indicated in pure Vata conditions should be given.
194. If Vata is occluded in the blood, the line of treatment, should be the same as indicated in rheumatic conditions.
1944 In condition of occlusion in the chyme, treatment curative of urinary disorders, morbid Vata and fat, should be given;
195. If Vata is occluded in the flesh, sudation, inunction, meat-juices, milk and unctuous medications are recommended,
195½. If Vata is occluded in the osseous tissue or the marrow, the preparation of the tetrad of unctuous articles should be given. If occluded in the semen, the treatment is as has already been described,
196-197. If Vata is occluded by food, emesis, digestives, digestive-stimulants and light diet are recommended. If occluded by urine, diuretics, sudation and urethral douches are recommended. If Vata is occluded by fecal matter, castor oil and unctuous therapy, as indicated in misperistalsis, are beneficial.
198. A morbid humor, while in its natural habitat, develops great strength; hence it should be first subdued by suitable medications such as emesis, purgation, enemata or sudation.
198½. Thus has been described systematically the treatment of conditions of occlusion of Vata by Pitta etc.
Symptoms of occlusion
199-199½. O sinless one! listen now to the symptoms described by me, in extenso as well as in brief, of the condition of occlusion brought about by mutual obstruction between the five types of Vata.
200. The Prana Vata occludes the Udana and other types of Vata while they too may occlude the Prana,
201-201½. Udana and all other types of Vata may occlude one another in the same manner. There would occur twenty conditions of occlusion caused by mutual obstruction of these five types of provoked Vata. The physician should be able to diagnose these conditions properly.
202-202½. On observing the loss of function of all the sense-organs, and loss of memory and strength, it should be diagnosed as the condition of the occlusion of Vyana by Prana The treatment is as indicated in diseases occurring in the parts above the supraclavicular region of the body.
203-203½. On observing excessive perspiration, horripilation, dermic morbidity and numbness of limbs, it should be diagnosed as the condition of Prana occluded by Vyana. The treatment in this is purgation combined with unctuous articles.
204-204½. In condition of occlusion of Samana by Prana, there will be scanty or slurring speech, or muteness. All the four modes of unctuous therapy along with Yapana enema are recommended as treatment.
205-205½. In condition of the occlusion of Apana by Samana, there will occur assimilation disorders aud diseases of the organs situated in hypo-chondriac region, gastric disorders and colicky pain of the stomach. Here the treatment indicated is the ghee medicated with digestive-stimulants.
206-207. In conditions of occlusion of Udana by Praua, there will occur spasticity of the head, coryza, impediment to inspiration and expiration, cardiac disorders and dryness of the mouth. Here, the treatment is as indicated in diseases of the parts above the supra-clavicular region and also comforting measures.
208-208½. In condition of occlusion of Prana by Udana, there will occur loss of function, of vital essence, of strength and of complexion or even death. This condition should be treated by gradual affusion with cold water and comforting measures, in such a way that the patient may be restored to health.
209-209½. In condition of the occlusion of Apana by Udana, there will occur vomiting, dyspnea and similar other disorders. The treatment therein is enema and similar measures, and diet conducive to regular peristalsis.
210-210½. In condition of the occlusion of Udana by Apana, there occur stupefaction, dullness of the gastric fire and diarrhea. The treatment there, is emesis and diet that is digestive stimulant and astringent.
211-211½. In condition of occlusion of Apana by Vyana, there occur the symptoms of vomiting, distension of abdomen, misperistalsis, Gulma, colic and griping pain. This condition should be treated by regulating peristalsis by means of unctuous medications.
212-212½. In condition of occlusion of Vyana by Apana, there occur excessive discharge of feces, urine and semen. There, the treatment indicited is astringent therapy.
213-213½. In condition of occlusion of Vyana by Samana, there occur fainting, torpor, garrulity, asthenia of the limbs, loss of gastric fire, vital essence and of strength. There, the treatment is exercise and light diet.
214214½. In condition of occlusion of Vyana by Udana, there occur rigidity, dullness of gastric fire, anhidrosis, loss of movement and absence of winking. There, the treatment is wholesome, measured and light diet.
215-215½. By their symptoms one should diagnose the condition of mutual occlusion of these five types of Vata; and it has been laid down that there will occur either the increase or decrease of its actions as the particular type of Vata is affected.
216-216½. Thus have been described in general this octad of the conditions of mutual occlusion along with their symptoms and treatment, in order to aid the understanding of intelligent physicians
217-218½. On investigating the habitat of each type of Vata, as well as the signs of increase or decrease of its functions, the physician should diagnose the remaining twelve conditions of mutual occlusions and should treat them by means of inunction, unctuous potion, enemata and all other procedures, or he may be given cold and hot measures in alternation.
219-220½. The Udana should be regulated upwards and the Apana downwards. The Samana should be sedated and the Vyana should be treated by all the three methods. Even more carefully than the other four types of Vata, the Prana should be maintained, because life depends on the proper maintenance of it in its habitat. Thus, the physician should regulate and establish in their normal habitats the various types of Vata that have been occluded and misdirected.
221-221½. In condition of occlusion of Prana by Pitta, there occur faining, burning, giddiness, colic, misdigestion, craving for cold things and vomiting of misdigested food.
222-222½. In condition of occlusion of Prana by Kapha, there occur symptoms such as salivation, sternutation, eructation, impediment to the inspiration and expiration, anorexia and vomiting.
223-223½. In condition of occlusion of Udana by Pitta there occur symptoms such as fainting and similar conditions, burning in the umbilical region and chest exhaustion, loss of vital essence and asthenia.
224-224½. In condition of occlusion of Udana by Kapha, there occur discoloration, the spasm of speech and voice, debility, heaviness of the body and anorexia.
225-225½. In condition of occlusion of the Samana by Pitta, there occur hyperidrosis, thirst, burning, fainting, anorexia and loss of body-heat
226-226½. In condition of occlusion of the Samana by Kapha, there occur anidrosis, dullness of the gastric fire, horripilation and excessive coldness of the limbs.
227-227½. In conditions of occlusion of Vyana by Pitta, there occur burning all over the body, exhaustion, loss of the movement of limbs accompanied with temperature and pain.
228-228½. In condition of occlusion of Vyana by Kapha, there occur symptoms such as heaviness of the limbs, pain in all the bones and joints, and excessive loss of movement.
229-229½. In condition of occlusion of Apana by Pitta, there occur symptoms such as yellow coloration of urine and feces, sensation of heat in the rectum and phallus and excessive flow of the menses.
230-230½. In condition of occlusion of Apana by Kapha, there occur stools that are loose, heavy and mixed with undigested matter and mucus and discharge of urine mixed with mucus.
231-231½. On observing the combined symptoms of Pitta and Kapha, the learned physician should diagnose it as a condition of combined occlusion
232-232½. If the two other humors get located in the places described as the habitats of Vata, they manifest various symptoms of disorders characteristic of each of them.
Serious Conditions
233-234½. Medical authorities regard, as most serious, the condition of occlusion of Prana or Udana by Kapha and Pitta combined, because life is particularly dependent on Prana, and vitality on Udana; and occlusion of them, will result in loss of life and vitality.
235-235½. If all these conditions are either undiagnosed or neglected for longer than a year, they become either incurable or formidable.
236-236½. As a result of the neglect of these conditions of occlusions, there occur complications such as cardiac disorders, abscesses, splenic disorders, Gulma and diarrhea.
237-237½. Therefore, the physician should diagnose the condition of occlusion of the five types of Vata, by Vita, Pitta or Kapha.
238-238½. After having well thought out the proper medications, he should treat the patient with measures which are non-liquefacient, unctuous and depurative of body-channels.
239-239½. In condition of occlusion of Vata in all its habitats, resort to prompt measures which are regulative of Vata and at the same time not antagonistic to Kapha and Pitta, is beneficial.
240-240½. The Yapana enemata as well as the unctuous enemata are generally beneficial, and if the vitality of the patient be found to be great, mild laxatives are beneficial.
241-241½. The use of all kinds of vitalizers is highly recommended. A course of mineral pitch and likewise a course of gum guggul, with milk is specially beneficial.
242-242½. Or, the patient living on milk diet, may take a course of the Cyavanaprasha linctus or the vitalizer known as the course of chebulic and emblic myrobalans, prepared with 4400 tolas of sugar.
243-243½. In condition of occlusion by Apana, all measures that are gastric-stimulant, astringent, regulative of peristalsis and depurative of the colon, constitute the treatment.
244-244½. Thus has been described in brief the line of treatment in conditions of occlusion of Prana and other types of Vata; the physician should use his own discretion and give the proper treatment.
General line of Treatment
245. He should use in a condition of occlusion of Vata by Pitta, medications curative of Pitta and not antagonistic to Vata, and in condition of its occlusion by Kapha, medications curative of Kapha and regulative of Vata.
246-247. Just as in the universe the courses of the wind, the sun and the moon are difficult to comprehend, even so is the case with the forces of the Vata, Pitta and Kapha in the body. The physician who knows the condition of decrease, increase, normality and occlusion of Vata and other humors, does not get deluded with regard to treatment.
Summary
Here are the two recapitulatory verses—
248-249. The Vata, being the subject of this chapter, the habitats and functions of the five-fold bodysustaining element Vata, have been dealt with here. The causes of provocation, the diseases which this lifecontrolling principle of Vata gives rise to in persons, when provoked; both in its own habitat and in other places; both in conditions of occlusion and in non-occlusion, and the treatment of all those diseases, have been fully expounded here. The physician, guided by the directions of the science, should administer the treatment, giving full consideration to factors of place, homologation, season and strength.
28. Thus, in the Section on Therapeutics, in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the twenty-eighth chapter entitled ‘The Therapeutics of Vata-Diseases [vatavyadhi-cikitsa]’ not being available, the same as restored by Dridhabala, is completed.
Etiology
5-7½. By habitual use of salt, acid, pungent, alkaline, unctuous and hot articles of diet, by predigestion-meals, by excessive indulgence in stale or dry flesh of aquatic and wet-land animals, or in the use of til paste or radish, or by taking horse gram, black gram, Nishpava and other greens, oil-cakes and sugar-cane, and by the use of curds, sour conjee, Sauvira-wine, vinegar, butter-milk, Sura-wine and medicated wines, by antagonistic diet, by eating on a loaded stomach, by anger, by daysleep and waking at night—by all these factors, the Vata and the blood become provoked, specially in the body of delicate persons and of those who are accustomed to sumptuous and luxurious diet and who are given to sedentary habits.
Pathology
8-11. When the blood gets vitiated consequent upon trauma or the omission of seasonal purification, and the Vata gets provoked by astringent, pungent, bitter, scanty and dry articles of diet or by abstinence from food, or by constant riding on horses or camels or in vehicles drawn by them or by aquatic games, swimming and jumping, by excessive way-faring in summer, by sexual indulgence and in suppression of the natural urges, the Vata gets increased. Getting obstructed in its course by the increased state of the blood, it vitiates the whole of the blood. This condition is known by various names, namely Vata-shonita, Khuda, Vata-balasa and Adhya-vata.
12. The sites of its manifestation are hands, feet, fingers, toes and all the joints. It establishes its base first in the hands and feet, and then spreads in the entire body.
13-15. By reason of the subtle and all-pervasive character of Vata, and of the liquid and flowing nature of the blood, the toxic element, spreading by means of the circulatory channels into the whole body, gets obstructed in the joints; and being agitated, it gets localized in the joints due to the tortuous nature of its course in the joints. Once localised, it becomes associated with Pitta or Vata and causes pains characteristic of each humor. Hence it generally causes pain in those joints only. The various kinds of pains thus caused are indeed exquisitely agonizing to their victims.
16-18. Excess or absence of perspiration, swarthiness, anesthesia, undue severity of pain [? or?] injury, looseness of the joints, lethargy, asthenia, appearance of pimples, pricking pain, splitting pain, enlargement and numbness of the knee, calf, thighs, waist, shoulder, hands, feet, and other body-parts; pruritus, frequent appearance and disappearance of pain in the joints, discoloration and appearance of round eruptions on the body—these are the premonitory symptoms of (Vāta-śonita) rheumatic condition.
Two Varieties
19. This condition is said to be of two kinds—superficial and deep. The superficial is the one affecting the skin and muscles; and the deep condition is the one affecting the deeper tissues of the body.
20. Pruritus, burning, pain, extension, aching or throbbing pain and contraction, accompanied with the dusky red or coppery coloration of the skin are considered the symptoms in the superficial type of rheumatic condition.
21. In the deeper type, there occur swelling, rigidity, hardness, agonizing pain inside the joints, dusky-red or coppery coloration, burning, pricking and throbbing pain, and tendency to suppuration.
22-23. The morbid Vata, while causing pain and morbid changes in the joints, constantly rushes about in the joints, bone and marrow as if cutting away the tissues, and tends to deformity of the joints. While pervading the whole body, it produces lameness or paraplegia. If all these symptoms are observed together, then the condition should be known as a combined one, both of the superficial as well as the deep types.
Symptoms in each Type
24. Listen now to the symptoms of the conditions of predominant provocation of each of Vata, blood, Pitta and Kapha as well as of bidiscordances and the combined discordance of all four.
25-26. Excessive distension of the veins, colic, throbbing, pricking pain, swarthiness and dryness, dark-red coloration increase and decrease of the swelling, contraction of the vessels, fingers and the joints, spasticity of the limbs, acute pain, contraction and stiffness and dislike for cold things—these are the symptoms in condition of increased Vata.
27. Swelling, excessive pain, pricking pain, coppery coloration, tingling sensation, non-yielding to either unctuous or dry treatment and accompaniment of pruritus and softening, are the symptoms in a condition of vitiation of blood.
28. Morbid change in the joints, pain, fainting, perspiration, thirst, intoxication, giddiness, redness, suppuration, breaking open and atrophy are the. symptoms of the condition of increased Pitta.
29. Fixity, heaviness, unctuousness, numbness and mild pain are the symptoms in condition of increased Kapha. Bidiscordance and tridiscordance of humors are to be recognised by the combinations of the etiological factors pr of the symptoms in each case.
Curable and Incurable conditions
30. That condition is curable which is of recent origin resulting from the provocation of a single humor. The condition resulting from bi-discordance is only palliable; and the condition born of tridiscordance as well as the one attended with complications, are incurable.
31-33½. The condition, associated with insomnia, anorexia, dyspnea, putrefaction of the flesh, spasticity of the head, fainting, intoxication, pain, thirst, fever, stupefaction, tremors, hiccup, lameness, acute spreading affection, suppuration, pricking pain, giddiness, exhaustion, deformity of fingers, moles, burning, affection of the vital parts and tumefaction (Arbuda) should not be taken up for treatment as also the condition attended with stupefaction only. Also, the condition associated with discharge, discoloration, stiffness, tumefaction, contraction and heating of the senses, should not be taken up for treatment.
34. That condition, which is attended with only some of the aforesaid complications, is palliable; and the one which is free from any complication is curable.
35. The provoked Vata, located in the joints of the extremeties, block the channels of the blood. Then the blood and the Vata obstruct each other's course and may even cause death, by the severity of the pain occasioned.
Blood-letting Therapy
36. In such a condition depletion of blood must be resorted by means of the horn or the leech or needle or by cupping with a gourd or by venesection, in keeping with the degree of morbidity and the strength of the patient,
37. Blood-letting by means of leach must be done where there is pain, burning, piercing and pricking pain. The horn and the gourd should be applied where there is numbness, pruritus and tingling sensation.
Contra-indication for Blood-letting
38. Where the pain is moving from place to place, venesection or cupping should be done. In a condition of asthenia of limb, depletion of blood should not be done. Also in a condition where dryness is the dominant factor in Vata-provocation, depletion should not be done.
39. For, as a result of the loss of blood, the Vata causes deep-seated edema, rigidity, tremors, disorders of the sinews and the vessels, asthenia and contractures.
40. Lameness and such other disorders of Vata or even death may result. Therefore, depletion in proper measure should be done, only in persons who are rich in the unctuous element.
41. The patient should first be oleated and then purged by means of unctuous purgative medications or by dry but mild purgative medications and then, frequent enemata should be administered-
41¾. Affusion, inunction, applications, diet and unctuous substances that are non-irritant are recommended in rheumatic conditions
42. Listen hereafter to an elaborate description of the treatment therein.
Treatment in Brief
43. The superficial type should be treated with unguents, inunction, affusions and poultices; while the deep type should be treated with purgation, corrective enema and unctuous potions.
44. The condition resulting from predominant provocation of Vata should be treated with potions, inunctions and enemata of ghee, oil, fat and marrow and with genially warm poultices.
45. The condition resulting from predominant provocation of blood and Pitta should be subdued by purgation, potions of ghee and milk, affusions, enemata, and cool and refrigerant applications.
46. In rheumatic condition resulting from predominant provocation of Kapha, mild emesis, a not excessive measure of oleation, affusion and fasting, and genially warm applications are recommended.
47. In a bidiscordant condition resulting from the predominant provocation of Kapha-cum-Vata, cold applications, by their astringent action, cause increase of burning, edema, pain and pruritus.
48. In a bidiscordant condition resulting from the predominant provocation of blood-cum-Pitta, hot applications cause burning, softening and bursting. Hence, the physician should first determine the relative strength of the morbid humors, and then begin the treatment.
49.Day sleep, excessive heat, excercise, sex-act as well as articles of diet that are pungent, hot, heavy, viscid, salt and acid should be avoided.
50.Barley, wheat and wild rice that are old or Shali and Shashtika rice are wholesome diet; and for meatjuices, the flesh of gallinaceous and pecker birds is wholesome.

139.The unguent prepared of the [root?] of crested-purple nail dye and cork swallow wort, pounded with goat’s milk and fried til, and cooled in milk, has similar effect.
140. In predominance of Vata-provocation, to alleviate the colicky pain, the physician should prescribe the unguent prepared of linseed pounded with milk.
141-144. An unguent should be prepared from 128 tolas of each of ghee, oil, fat and marrow of aquatic animals and birds, in the decoction of castor roots, sprouts and leaves and with the paste of the drugs of the life-promoter group and the milks of the cow and the goat, adding 4 tolas of each of turmeric, blue water-lily, costus, cardamom, dill seeds, leaves of Indian oleander and flowers of arjun. When this is prepared and is in a warm condition, mix it with 33 tolas of bee’s wax. This unguent when cold should be applied in condition of the affections of joints, pain in organs due to Vata-provocation, in rheumatic condition, in dislocation and fracture of the joints and in lameness and deformity.
Treatment in Kapha Type
145. In rheumatic condition associated with predominaut Kapha-provocation, when there is swelling, heaviness and itching etc. the medicated ghee prepared from cow’s ghee, cow’s urine, alkali and sura wine, used as inunction, is beneficial.
146. The medicated ghee, prepared from ghee with the paste of Himalayan cherry, cinnamon bark, liquorice, and Indian sarsaparilla and mixed with honey-vinegar, is beneficial as inunction and affusion in rheumatic conditions associated with predominant Kapha-provocation.
147. In rheumatic conditions associated with predominant Kapha-provocation, alkalis, oils, cow’s urine, and water prepared with pungent drugs are recommended as affusion,
148. The unguent prepared from rape-seed, neem, mudar, Indian nightshade, alkali and til is beneficial; and the unguent prepared of the bark of wood-apple, ghee and milk, along with the powder of roasted paddy, is molt beneficial.
Treatment in Vata-cum-kapha
149. The unguent, prepared from kitchen soot, sweet flag, costus, dill seeds, turmeric and Indian berberry, is curative of rheumatic conditions associated with predominant provocation of Vata-cum-Kapha.
150. The unguent, prepared from Indian valerian, cinnamon bark, dill seeds, small cardamom, costus, nutgrass. fragrant piper, deodar and shell, rubbed with acid articles, is curative of rheumatic conditions associated with predominant provocation of Vata cum-Kapha.
151. The unguent, prepared from the seeds of sweet drumstick pounded with sour conjee, acts similarly. After applying this unguent and keeping it there for a period of a muhurta (48 minutes), the part should be affused with acid lotions in rheumatic condition associated with predominant provocation of Vata-cum-Kapha.
152-154. The paste should be prepared of equal parts of the three myrobalans, the three spices, cinnamon-leaf, cardamom, bamboo manna, white flowered leadwort, sweet flag, embelia, root of long pepper, iron sulphide, bark of Vasaka, Riddhi, featherfoil and chaba pepper. A vessel should be lined with this paste in the morning, and in the noon the patient should eat his meals in that vessel. The patient should avoid curds, vinegars, alkali and other antagonistic articles. This soon cures severe rheumatic condition born of tridiscordance as well as colic,
155. The expert physician versed in the science of pharmaceutics, should carry out this treatment with due regard to the particular seat of affection and the relative strength of the morbid conditions.
Treatment according to Stage
156. When the Vata is provoked as a result of the blockage in the body-channels caused by the excessive increase of fat and Kapha, the oleation and roborant therapy in the early stage itself, is contra-indicated;
157. The Kapha and the fat should be reduced by means of exercise, purificatory procedures, potions of medicated wines and cow’s urine, purgation and the courses of buttermilk and of chebulic myrobalan.
158-159. The decoction of the holy fig tree; taken as a potion mixed with honey, subdues rheumatic condition quickly, even if caused by severe tridiscordance. The condition may also be cured by a course of old barley, wheat, Sidhu wine, medicated wine or Sura wine or by a course of mineral pitch and gum gugul or honey.
160. When the rheumatic condition has affected the deep tissues, the physician should treat the condition as if it were a Vata-disorder. After the Vata is subdued, the line of treatment curative of rheumatic conditions should be given.
161-162. Owing to the excessive increase of the blood and the Pitta, the condition soon terminates in suppuration; the part breaks open and discharges putrid blood or pus. Here, the treatment should be given of incision, purification and healing and the physician should treat the complications in the manner indicated in each of them.
Summary
Here are the recapitulatory verses—
163-165. The causes of affection, its sites and why it gets provoked mostly in the joints, the premonitory symptoms, characteristics of the two types, signs and symptoms of each type, excessive morbidity, complications, curability, palpability and incurability, and the entire treatment of curable types of the rheumatic condition are described in general and in detail, as also the treatment at different stages of the disease, by the great sage to Agnivesha,
29. Thus in the Section on Therapeutics, in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the twenty-ninth chapter entiled ‘The Therapeutics of Rheumatic conditions [vāta-śoṇita—vata-shonita-cikitsa]’ not being available, the same as restored by Dridhabala, is completed.
Number and Pathology
7. Being thus questioned by the disciple, the foremost of sages, the son of Atri, spoke and said “Twenty are the gynecic disorders enumerated in the Chapter on Nomenclature of diseases (Chapter XIX Sutra).
8. These diseases in women are born of wrongful behaviour, menstrual vitiation, germinal morbidity and of destiny. Now listen as I describe them individually.
9-10½. In the woman of Vata-habitus, the Vata gets greatly increased by Vata-inducing diet and behaviour, then gets localised in the gynecic organs and produces local pain and pricking sensation, rigidity, formication, roughness, numbness, exhaustion and various other disorders resulting from Vata. The menstrual discharge will be attended with sound and pain. It will be frothy, thin and ununctuous due to Vata.
11-12. Owing to the use of pungent, acid, salt, alkaline and similar articles, gynecic disorders of the Pitta-type will occur. The patient will be afflicted with burning, suppuration, fever and heat and the menstrual blood will be of bluish, yellowish or black in color, and there appears profuse, warm and offensive discharge from the vagina, in condition of vitiation due to Pitta.
13-13½. If the Kapha, increased by liquefacient factors, vitiates the gynecic organs of a woman, it will cause the vagina to be slimy, cold, itching, mildly painful and pallid, and causes menstrual flow of a whitish and slimy character.
14-15. In a woman taking promiscuous diet of all tastes and kinds, all the three humors situated in the uterus and vagina become provoked and produce locally their characteristic symptoms. The person becomes afflicted locally with burning and aching pains and there will be white and slimy vaginal discharge.
16. If, in a woman, the blood is vitiated by Pitta, by factors causative of hemothermia, there will be excessive flow of blood from the uterus (Menorrhagia). Even after conception, the discharge of blood from the uterus continues.
17. If the Pitta situated in the vagina and uterus vitiates the blood, there will be absence of menstruation. This condition is known as Arajaska (Amenorrhea) [arajaskā]. This condition causes extreme emaciation and discoloration of the body.
18. Owing to lack of washing of the vagina, mycotic growth occurs there and causes itching. The condition is called Acarana (Colpitis mycotica) [acaranā]. This causes itching, and the person is affected with excessive desire for the male.
19. The Vata in women, being provoked by excessive sexual congress, produces in the vagina, edema, numbness and pain. This condition is called Aticarana (chronic Vaginitis) [aticaranā].
20. Owing to sexual congress, in a girl of tender age, the Vata, getting provoked, vitiates the vagina and produces pain in the back, waist, thigh and groin. This condition is called Prakcarana (Deflorative Vaginitis) [prākcarana].
21-22. In a gravida, by the habitual use of Kapha-promoting articles or by suppression of the urge for vomiting and breathing, the Vata gets provoked and carrying the Kapha to the vagina, vitiates it giving rise to painful yellowish discharge or whitish flow of mucus The vaginal condition, thus being pervaded by Kapha and Vata, is known as Upapluta (Leucorrhea)
23. If a woman of Pitta-habitus suppresses the urge for sternutation or eructation during sexual congress, the Vata combined with the Pitta, vitiates her vagina.
24. The vagina gets edematous, tender to the touch and painful, and there is a bluish or yellowish or sanguinous discharge. The woman becomes afflicted with pain in the waist, groin and back, and with fever. This condition is called Paripluta (Acute Vaginitis).
25. Owing to reversal of normal course of Vata-movement there occurs the reversal of the course of uterine contraction The woman becomes afflicted witn pain, and discharges with great difficulty the menses that is tending in a reverse direction.
26.But, immediately after the whole menstrual blood is discharged, she feels great relief. Owing to the reverse movement of the menstrual flow, the condition is called, by learned physicians, Udavartini (Dysmenorrhea).
27-27½. If the gravida strains prematurely to expel the fetus, the Vata gets obstructed by the fetus and thus gets provoked: being combined with the Kapha and blood, it causes a tumefaction of the shape of the ear in the gynecic region. This causes obstruction to the passage of blood. It is called Karnini (Endocervicitis) [karṇinī].
28-28½ The condition where the Vata, by its quality of dryness, destroys each and every conception produced from the vitiated germ (ovum), is known by the name of Putraghni (abortive tendency) [putraghnī].
29-30½. The Vata, located in the uterine passage of a woman who has sexual congress just after a surfeit meal and who has assumed injurious postures during sexual congress, gets provoked and distorts the mouth of the uterus, The woman gets greatly afflicted with pain in the bone and flesh, and due to excessive pain, becomes incapable of sexual congress. This condition is called ‘Antarmukhi’ (Inversion of uterus).
31. During the fetal life of a female if, owing to the faulty behaviour of the mother, the morbid Vata by its dryness vitiates the gynecic organs of the embryo, there may occur stenosis of the gynecic passages. This condition is called ‘Sucimukhi’ (Colpostenosis) [sūcīmukhī].
32-32½. The Vata, provoked by suppression of the natural congress, causes pain, retention of feces and urine, and dryness of the uterus. This condition is called Colpoxerosis.
33-33½. The condition, where the semen which has been deposited six or seven days previously in the genital passages, is thrown out accompanied with or without pain, is called Vamini (Proluvium Seminit) [vāminī].
34-34½. In a condition, where the development of gynecic organs is disordered by the Vata located in the uterus, the germinal morbidity gives birth to a woman who has an aversion for man and who has no breasts. This is called gynandroid condition and is incurable.
35-35½. The Vata, being provoked by injurious postures in sexual cong-gress or by uncomfortable beds, will dilate the orifice of the woman’s vagina and the uterus.
36-36½. It will cause the condition of dilation of the external orifice, pain, and dry frothy and sanguinous discharge. There appears a protuberance of flesh and causes pain in the joints and the groin This is the condition of ‘Mahayoni’ (Prolapse of the Uterus) [mahāyoni].
37-38. Thus have been described the signs and symptoms of the twenty disorders affecting the gynecic organs. The gynecic organs, which are affected by these morbid conditions, do not retain the semen. The woman, therefore, does not attain conception and becomes liable to many diseases like Gulma, piles, leucorrhea and similar other conditions and gets greatly afflicted with the discordance of Vata and other humors.
Classification
39-40. Out of the last sixteen disorders, the first two are due to vitiation of Pitta; acute vaginitis and profluvium semenis are considered to be due to Vata-cum-Pitta, Leucorrhea and endocervicitis are due to Vata-cum-Kapha. The remaining are due to Vata. The Vata and the other morbid humors afflict the body with their characteristic symptoms.
General Line of Treatment
41-42½. In gynecic disorders born of Vata, oletion, sudation, enemata etc., curative of Vata should be administered; and the condition born of Pitta should be treated with medications that are cooling and curative of hemothermia. In condition born of morbid Kapha, dry and hot measures should be administered by the learned physician. In conditions of bi and tri discordances, medications suitably combined should be administered.
43-44½ In conditions of displacement of uterus, the part should be given oleation and sudation procedures and then should be replaced in its proper position. If it be curled, or distorted, it should be changed in its position by manipulation of the hand, If it is stenosed, it should be dilated. If it has slipped out of its normal position, it should be re-established in its position. If the orifice is unduly dilated, it should be constricted. If the uterus is prolapsed and completely exposed, it should be regarded and treated as a. foreign body in the woman.
45-45½. In all varieties of gynecic disorders, the patient should be treated with the pentad of purificatory procedures, i.e., emesis etc., in a mild degree; after she has been first subjected to oleation and sudation therapies
46. When thoroughly cleansed by purification, the rest of the treatment is to be given.
47-48½. To those that are afflicted with morbid Vata, the Vata-curative medications are always beneficial. They should be given the diet of the flesh of aquatic and wet-land creatures along with milk, til and rice. They should be subjected to the kettle and pitcher-bed sudation-procedures:medi-cated with Vata-curative drugs. And after anointing them with oil mixed with rock salt, they should be given stone-bed sudation and hot-bed sudation, mixed fomentation, then bathed in genially warm water and then given the diet of meat-juices medicated with Vata-curative drugs.

Describe also impotency which is of four types as well as the etiology, symptoms aud the lines of treatment of the complications of gynecic disorders in which colporrhea has been mentioned as one, Describe them in brief and in extenso too, O, best among physicians!”
132. To the disciple who inquired thus, the best among sages replied and said:
Pathology of Seminal Disorders
133. “Seminal secretion in man is born of the excitement due to the contact with female genital organ during sexual congress and acts as the fertilising agent. Listen as I now describe its morbid conditions.
134. As the seed, which is impaired by untimely watering or unseasonal rains or by parasites, insects and fire, does not grow, similar is the case with the vitiated semen in man.
135-138½. By excessive sexual indulgence, bodily exertion and habitual use of unwholesome diet, and by untimely sexual congress, or by sexual abstinence or by the habitual use of dry, bitter, astringent, very saltish, acid, or hot articles, or sexual congress with an unresponsive woman or owing to old age, worry, grief, or lack of mutual confidence or to injury by weapon, caustics or fire or owing to fear; anger, black magic, emaciation due to diseases, suppression of the natural urges or owing to injury or vitiation of body-elements, the humors get provoked either singly or collectively; and reaching the seminal vessels soon, they vitiate the semen excessively.
139-139½. Now I shall describe each of the conditions according to its classification. Frothiness, thinness, dryness, discoloration, putrid smell, sliminess, admixture with other body-elements and sinking when put in water, are the eight conditions of seminal morbidity.
140-140½. Owing to morbid Vata, the semen becomes frothy, thin, ununctuous and scanty, and discharges with difficulty, suffers vitiation and precludes conception.
141-141½. The semen, vitiated by Pitta, is of bluish or yellowish tinge, is very hot, putrid in smell, and causes burning in the phallus while it is being discharged.
142 When the seminal passage is obstructed by Kapha, the semen becomes excessively viscid.
143. Owing to excessive sexual indulgence or to injury or ulcerations, the semen is discharged mixed generally with blood.
144-144½. Owing to the suppression of natural urges, the semen being obstructed by Vata in its course becomes clotted and is discharged with difficulty; it sinks when put in water. This is the eighth kind of morbidty Thus have been described the eight kinds of seminal disorders with their characteristic signs
145-145½. That should be known as pure or normal semen, which is viscid, dense, slimy, sweet, non-irritant and whitish, and transparent like a crystal in appearance.
146-147. When the semen, gets vitiated it should be treated with the virilific recipes which are pleasant to take and beneficial, combined, with the remedies indicated in hemothermia and gynecic complications [yoni-vyapad].
148. The life-promoter ghee and the linctus named Cyavana-prasha and the course of mineral pitch, remove the seminal morbidity.
148½-150. When the semen is vitiated by Vata, evacuative and unctuous enemata are beneficial and if it is vitiated by Pitta the compound vitalizing elixir of chebulic and emblic myrobalans is recommended. If the vitiation of semen is by Kapha, then the course of vitalizing elixir of long pepper, guduch, iron or the three myrobalans, or that of the marking nut (Chapter I Cikitsā), removes the morbidity.
151. If the semen be combined with any other body-element, the proper corrective for the morbid element should be combined and given, after examining systematically the nature of the morbidity.
152-152½. Ghee, milk, meat-juices, Shali rice, barley, wheat and Shashtika rice are beneficial in vitiated condition of the semen, and enemata are specially indicated. Thus have been described by the sage, the treatment of the eight kinds of seminal morbidity.
153-153½. If impotency is caused by seminal morbidity, it gets cured by the purification of the semen. Henceforth O, Agnivesha! I shall fully describe systematically the subject of impotency.
Impotency
154-154½. Impotency results from seminal morbidity, the disorders of the phallus, old age and loss of semen. Now listen to an account of its general symptoms.
155-157. The following are the characteristics of impotency:—though continually preoccupied mentally with sexual thoughts, yet the person does not approach the willing partner, or approaches her very rarely if ever. Owing to impaired erective power, he is afflicted with hard breathing, perspiration of the entire body, lack of erection and lack of sperm, and his desire and efforts at mating get frustrated. These are the general symptoms of impotency. They will now be described in detail.
158-161¾. As a result of cold, dry, scanty, vitiated and antagonistic diet or pre-digestion meals, owing to grief, anxiety, fear and terror, or due to excessive indulgence in women, loss of nutrient fluid and other body elements, owing to discordance of Vata and other humors, or owing to fasting, fatigue, lack of response in the sexual partner or wrongful effects of the quinary procedures of purification, there occurs vitiation of semen, and the person becomes pale of color, very weak, low-spirited and of feeble erective power. He gets afflicted with cardiac disorders, anemia, asthma, jaundice, prostration, vomiting diarrhea and colicky pain, cough and fever. This is the impotency caused by seminal morbidity.
162-167½. Now listen to the description of the diseases of the phallus, leading to impotency. As a result of excessive intake of acid, salt, alkaline, antagonistic and unwholesome diet, or drinking excessive quantities of water or eating irregular meals, or by taking heavy pastry, excessive use of curds, milk and the flesh of wet-land animals, or owing to emaciation due to diseases, cohabitation with virgins, sexual enjoyment in parts other than the vagina, cohabitation by one in a moment of excitement and passion with a woman who suffers from chronic disease or who has practised sexual abstinence for long or who is in her menses, or whose vagina is diseased or is offensive in smell or is discharging profusely, or mating with a quadruped, or trauma to the phallus, or want of proper cleansing of the penis, or owing to lesions caused by instruments, teeth, nail or stick or compression, or by excessive use of Shuka worms for elongation of the phallus, and also by suppression of seminal discharge, the phallus is afflicted with disorders.
168. (I shall hereafter describe the signs and symptoms that occur in a condition). There are observed swelling pain and redness in the phallus. There occur acute sores and also the suppuration of the phallus.
169-170. There may occur fleshy growth or quick ulceration of the part. There will be discharge of dusky red coloration or of the color of rice-water; there will be circular, hard constriction formed just above the glans penis.
171. The patient will suffer from fever, thirst, giddiness, fainting and vomiting. There may be red, dark, blue, turbid or sanguinous discharge.
172-174½. There will be acute burning pain as if burnt by fire, and pain in bladder, testes, perineum and groin. Sometimes there is slimy, yellowish-white discharge; the part may be swollen; there may be dull pain, induration and scanty discharge. It may take time to suppurate or may abate quickly or it may be infected with parasites; and it becomes softened and putrid in smell. The glans penis drops off, or even the whole phallus and scrotum may slough out.
175-175½. Thus has been described the impotency resulting from the disorders of the phallus. Some describe these disorders of the phallus as being of five kinds.
176-177. Listen now as I describe the geratic impotency. Age is classified into three divisions: childhood, adulthood and renascence. The semen in senile persons gets generally low or diminished.
178-180¼. Owing to diminution of the nutrient fluid and other body elements and the constant use of things which are detrimental to male-hood, by gradual diminution of strength, vitality, the power of the sense-organs and of the life-span, and owing to inanition, fatigue and exhaustion, there occurs geratic impotency in man. Affected by this, he becomes extremely wasted in all the bodv-elements, very weak, poor in complexion, physically and mentally depressed, and soon falls a victim to diseases. These are the characteristics of geratic impotency.
181-184½. Hear now about the fourth kind of impotency born of wasting. By constant indulgence in worry, grief, anger, fear, envy, eagerness, intoxication and anxiety; by ununctuous eats and drinks or ununctuous remedies resorted to by a man who is emaciated; by resort to fasting by one who is weak by nature, and by unwholesome diet, the nutrient fluid which is the primary body-element and whose habitat is the stomach, gets soon diminished. Consequently, the blood and the other body-elements right up to the seminal Secretion get diminished. The semen is considered to be the highest or the final product and state of the body-elements.
185-187. If such a man, getting mentally excited and passionate; indulges excessively in sex, his semen gets soon exhausted and he becomes emaciated and will be subject to serious ailment or death itself. Therefore, one desirous of protecting his health, should specially preserve one’s semen. Thus have been described the four kinds of impotency with their etiology and signs and symptoms.
188. Some say that the two kinds of impotency i.e., the one due to diseases of the phallus and the other to wasting, are incurable; similarly the impotency due to amputation of the penis or excision of the testes is regarded as incurable.
189-190. As a result of germo-spermic morbidity inherited from the parents or of the sins of past life, the morbid humors, entering the seminal vessels during the embryonic life, cause the atrophy of the genital organs. Owing to this atrophy, the function of semen-formation is lost. In such condition the person, though having full physical development, becomes an emasculated man (androgynoid condition). Of the varieties of impotency described above, those caused by tridiscordance of humors are considered incurable.
Treatment of Impotency
191-192. Henceforth will be described the treatment of impotency in brief and in extenso. Now listen, O, Sinless one! the medications indicated by me in the morbid condition of semen, cachexia and pectoral lesions are regarded as beneficial in impotency.
193-194. The physician, versed in the knowledge of the proper time of each therapeutic measure, should make use of enemata. milk and ghee and whatever are considered virilific medications and vitalizers, having diagnosed the strength of the body, the morbid humors and the gastric fire, in the impotency caused by sexual indulgence as well as in that caused by the vitiation of body-elements.
195. Where the impotency is caused by black magic, resort must be had to divine medication (through prayer and worship). Thus has been described in brief the treatment of impotency.
196-197½. I shall describe again, at length, the treatment of various kinds of impotency. The patient should lie given unctuous purgative after Oleation and sudation procedures. He must then be given food or corrective enema, after which the wise physician should give him an Unctuous enema. He should again be given a corrective euema of palas, castor and nut-grass.
198-198½. Virilific medications, that have been already described, should be given to him by the physician, in the condition of impotency due to seminal morbidity.
199-201. If impotency is due to the loss of erectile power or phallic disorders, it should be treated in the following manner. The prescribed applications, affusions or depletion of blood should be done; unctuous potion and unctuous purgation should be given followed by an unctuous or corrective enema. Thereafter, the intelligent physician should carry out the line of treatment indicated in wounds.
202.In geratic impotency and impotency due to wasting, the patient should be purified by means of unctuous measures after he has undergone oleation and sudation procedures.
203-203½. His further treatment consists of the administration of milk, ghee, virilific medications, Yapana enemata and the use of vitalizing elixirs. Thus has been described elaborately the treatment of impotency.
Colporrhea
204. Now listen to the description of the etiology etc., of colporrhea which has been previously mentioned.
205-209. In a woman who is habituated to excess of salt, acid, heavy, pungent, irritant and unctuous articles and to the flesh of domestic, aquatic and fatty creatures, or to kedgeree, milk pudding, curds, vinegar, whey, Sura wine, and such other articles, the Vata, getting provoked, increases the quantity of blood in the body and gets lodged in the vessels that go to the uterus, conveying the menstrual fluid; it leads the blood to that region. As it increases the menstrual fluid in quantity by its fluidity, it is called the blood-flow by the gynecologist. As the menstrual blood breaks its way from this surcharge it is called Pradara or colporrhea. Thus has been described, in general, the etiology and the signs and symptoms.
209½. There are four kinds of colporrhea caused by each of the three humors individually as well as the one caused by the tridiscordance of humors.
210-211. Hereafter, I shall describe their causes and symptoms and treatment. The Vata, provoked by dry articles etc., bringing blood as described already, causes colporrhea. Now listen to its signs and symptoms, as I describe them.
212-213. The discharge is frothy, thin, unctuous, dusky-red and of the color of the juice of palas flower; and it may be painless or painful. The Vata causes acute pain in the waist, groin, cardiac region, sides, back and hips. This is known as colporrhea due to Vata.
214. The Pitta, provoked by acid, hot, salt and alkaline articles, causes colporrhea, as already described, of the Pitta type. Now listen to its signs and symptoms.
215-215¾. There will be frequent and painful discharge which is bluish or yellowish, very warm, dark or deep red and is accompanied with local burning and redness, thirst, stupefaction, fever and giddiness. This is colporrhea of the Pitta type.
216-217. Now will be described colporrhea of the Kapha type. The Kapha provoked by etiological factors such as heavy articles of diet etc., causes colporrhea of the Kapha type. Now listen to its main characteristics.
218-218½. The discharge is slimy, yellowish, white in color, heavy, unctuous, cold, muco-sanguinous, and dense, and is accompanied with mild pain. It is attended with vomiting, anorexia, nausea, dyspnea and cough.
219-220. What will be described as the general causes of the morbidity of the mother’s milk are also to be considered the causative factors of colporrhea of the tridiscordance type. In colporrhea of the tridiscordance type, where all the above symptoms are combined, the disease will he characterised by various conditions.
221-224. If a woman, very much exhausted or greatly wasted in blood indulges in what are causative factors of this disease, the Vata getting excessively increased and passing through the blood-channels, causes the opposing Kapha to be heated by the fire of Pitta and converts it into a slimy offensive and yellowish fluid; and mixing with fat and the adipose tissue, it flows out forcibly through the vagina; and this discharge is of the color of ghee or marrow or fat. This is a continual discharge accompanied with thirst, burning and fever. The woman, wasted of blood and rendered weak as a result should be considered incurable.
225. That should be regarded as healthy or normal menses which occurs every month, which is not slimy, which is not attended with burning or pain, which lasts for five days and which is neither excessive nor very scanty.
226. That should be regarded as the healthy or normal menstrual blood which is of the color of the jequirity-seed or of the lotus or of lac or which resembles the trombidium (the scarlet insect).
227. The physician should use all medications indicated in gynecic disorders caused by Vata and other humors, in these four kinds of colporrhea.
228. He should also use the remedies indicated in diarrhea with bloody stools, in hemothermia and in bleeding piles.
229. The qualities of the well-formed breasts and the breast-milk of the wet nurse have been already described by me in detail. So too have been described the galacta gogues and the galacto-depurants.
230-231. So also the signs of vitiation of the breast-milk by Vata and other humors, along with its treatment All this, along with the eight kinds of morbidity of milk, have been described. The able physician endowed with scientific vision should classify these into the categories of Vata and other humors. As there are three classes of pupils in view of their grades of intelligence, I describe the subject in detail to be useful even to the lowest of them.
Galactic Morbidity
232-236. By taking predigestion meals, unwholesome, irregular, antagonistic and excessive diet, by constant use of salt, acid, pungent, alkaline and softened articles, by mental and bodily affliction, sleeplessness at night, brooding, suppression of the manifested urges and artificially exciting such urges, and by indulgence in day-sleep after frequent eating of milk pudding, products of gur, kedgeree, immature curds, liquefacient flesh of domestic, wet-land and aquatic creatures; by excessive use of wine, lack of exertion, trauma, anger and emaciation due to diseases, the humors, getting provoked, reach the galactic channels, vitiate the milk and cause eight kinds of galactic morbidity. Now listen, as I describe them again, according to each category of morbidity.
237. In condition of vitiation of Vata, the milk will be distasteful, frothy and unctuous. In vitiation by Pitta, there will be discoloration and bad smell. In vitiation by Kapha unctuousness, sliminess and heaviness will be observed.
238. The Vata gets provoked by dry articles of diet and similar other Vata provoking factors. Thus, getting provoked and reaching the mammary glands, it vitiates their secretions.
239. The child, who sucks this distasteful milk vitiated by Vata, becomes emaciated. It does not relish the milk and its growth becomes difficult.
240. Similarly the provoked Vata churns up the milk internally in the glands and makes it frothy. Consequently, it flows out with great difficulty.
241. The child which drinks this milk becomes weak of voice and suffers from stasis of feces, of urine and flatus. It develops headache or-coryza of the Vata-type.
242. The Vata which is provoked as before, dehydrates the unctuous element in the milk. The child, taking this unctuous milk, is reduced in' strength, by the lack of unctuous quality in the milk.
243. The Pitta, getting provoked by hot articles and similar other factors, reaching the mammary glands, causes discoloration of the milk into bluish, yellowish, dark and other shades.
244. The child who takes this milk gets changed in body-color and is afflicted with perspiration, thirst and loose stools; its body is always felt to be warm, and it shows dislike for the breast-feed,
245. The Pitta, provoked as above gives a bad smell to the milk, and the child drinking that milk is afflicted with anemia and jaundice,
246. The Kapha, provoked by heavy articles and similar other factors, reaches the woman's mammary glands and by its unctuous quality, renders the milk hyper unctuous.
247. The child sucking this milk, suffers from vomiting, tussive sounds, dribbling of saliva, increase of mucus in body-channels, sleepiness, exhaustion, dyspnea, cough, ptyalism aud asthma
248. When the Kapha vitiates the milk and makes it slimy, the child sucking this milk, suffers from slobber; its face and eyes become swollen and the child becomes dull.
249-250. The Kapha getting located in the mammary glands, causes heaviness of milk; owing to its quality of heaviness, the child drinking that milk is afflicted with the diseases of the stomach and various other disorders born of morbid milk.
250½. If the breast-milk is vitiated by Vata or other humors, diseases corresponding in characteristics to the humor will afflict the child.
251-251½. For the purification of the breast milk, the physician should, at first, systematically treat the mother with oleation and sudation procedures and then give her emesis.
252-252½. Sweet flag, perfumed cherry, liquorice, emetic nut, kurchi and rape-seed may be given in the form of paste; or the bark of neem and wild snake gourd, may be given as decoction, mixed with salt.
253-253½. The patient that has been systematically subjected to emesis and rehabilitation procedure, should he given purgation preceded by oleation. in keeping with the. patients degree of morbidity and strength, and also the season.
254-255. He should be given the pulvis of turpeth, and chebulic myrobalan mixed with the decoction of the three myrobalans and honey, or he should be given the pulvis of chebulic myrobalan only mixed with cow’s urine, with a view to cause purging.
256. After she has been purged well and given the rehabilitation procedure, the wise physician should treat the residual morbidity iu her, by a regular course of suitable food and drink.
257-257½. Sali or Shashtika rice sanwa millet or italian millet, common millet, barley or bamboo barley are beneficial as diet. The tender shoots of bamboo, cane-sprouts and chickling vetch should be used as vegetable-curry, prepared with unct nous substances.
258. Green gram, lentils and horse gram may be used for preparing soup.
259. The patient should be given a potion of the soups of the sprouts of neem and cane, carilla fruit, brinjal and emblic myrobalans, mixed with the pulvis of the three spices and rock-salt; they are galacto-depurants.
259½. The flesh of hare, grey partridge and Indian antelope, should be given well-cooked as food.
260-260½. The water prepared with black-nightshade, dita bark, cinnamon bark and winter-cherry may be used for drinking; or the decoction of kurroa may be given as potion for the purification of breast-milk.
261-261¾. The decoction of the bark of guduch and dita bark, the decoction of ginger or the decoction of chiretta should be taken as potion and all three, each one described in a quarter of the verse, may be taken for the purification of breast-milk.
262-262½. Thus has been described the treatment of the morbidity of breast-milk in general. Now listen to the treatment of various conditions described separately.
Treatment
263- 263½. In condition of vitiated taste of the breast-milk, grapes, liquo-rice, sarsaparilla and the fine powder of milky yam, should be given mixed with genially warm water.
264-264½. The paste of the pentad of spices and horse-gram should be applied to the breast and when it is dried, the breast should be washed and the accumulated milk drawn out Thus, the breast-milk gets purified,
265-266½. The woman whose milk is frothy should be given a potion of Patha, ginger, black nightshade, and trilobed virgin’s bower, pounded in genially warm water and as in the previous case, the breast should be painted with the paste of the extract of Indian berberry, ginger, deodar, roots of bael and perfumed cherry. This purifies the milk.
267-268. Chiretta, dry ginger and guduch should be decocted and be given by the physician as potion to the mother or wet-nurse, for curing/ the galactic morbidity: and the breasts should be painted with the paste of barley, wheat and rape-seed.
269. The woman, whose breastmilk is un-unctuous, should drink the milk or ghee, medicated with drugs mentioned as galacto-depurants in the chapter on six hundred purgative drugs.
270. As already described, the drugs of the pentaradices of the Jivaka group should be made into paste and painted on the breast in a genially warm temperature, for the purification of the breast-milk.
271. Liquorice, grapes, milky yam and chaste tree, pounded and taken as potion with cold water, destroys the discoloration of breast-milk.
272. The woman’s breast should be painted with the paste of grapes and liquorice and when dried, the breasts should be washed with water and the milk drawn away repeatedly.
273. Stinking swallow-wort and Ajashringi [ajaśṛṅgī], the three myrobalans, tur meric and sweet flag, reduced to paste and taken as potion with cold water, destroy the foul odor of the breastmilk.
274. If the mother takes the linctus made of the powder of chebulic myrobalans and the three spices, mixed with honey and observes the regimen of diet, the bad odor of the milk gets rectified.
275. (1) Sarsaparilla, cuscus grass, madder, Assyrian plum and red sandal; (2) or cinnamon bark, fragrant sticky mallow, sandal and cuscus grass, should be rubbed into paste and painted on the breasts.
276. In condition of viscid or heavy breast-milk, deodar, nut grass and Patha should be pounded and, taken as potion in genially warm water mixed with rock salt. This will quiskly purify the breast-milk.
277. The woman wit hslimy milk should be given as potion black nightshade, chebulic myrobalans, sweet, flag, nut grass, ginger and Patha reduced to paste with water, for clarification of the milk.
278. Or, she may drink curdswine which has been described as curative of piles White yam, bael and liquorice should be made into paste and applied on the breasts.
279. The decoction of zalil, guduch, neem, wild snake-gourd and the three myrobalans, taken as potion by the woman whose breast-milk is heavy, quickly purifies the galactic morbidity.
280. Similarly, the decoction of the roots of long pepper, chaba pepper, white flowered leadwort and ginger may be taken as potion. Heart-leaved sida, ginger, black night-shade and trilobed virgin’s bower should be reduced to paste and applied to the breasts.
280½. Similarly, the paste of painted leaved uraria and milky yam may be applied.
281-281½. These are the eight kinds of galactic disorders described, with their etiology, signs, and symptoms and treatment. Some disorders, resulting from these galactic morbidity have also been described.
282-282½. The humoral morbidity, the susceptible body-elements, the waste matter and the diseases that effect the adults affect also children, but only in a smaller degree.
283-284½. The specialist in pediatrics should not administer emesis and other purificatory procedures, in view of the tenderness, dependency and inabillity to fully express themselves in. speech and gestures, of children He should give only small doses of medicine appropriate to the disease,
285. The wise physician should administer with great care and mixed with milk and sweet decoctions drugs that are mild in action.
286. Medication and food and drink, that are excessively unctuous, un-unctuous, acid and pungent in postdigestive effect, and heavy in quality are contra-indicated in children.
287. This, in brief, is the direction regarding the treatment of all the diseases occurring in children, and the physician should treat the diseases having first classified them according to their humoral category.
Here are verses again—
288. Thus has been expounded the therapeutics of all diseases; and this section on treatment contains the most essential part of this treatise.
289-290. The seventeen chapters and the sections on pharmaceutics and successive treatment in the treatise composed by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka have not been found. These, Dridhbala, the son of Kapilabala reconstructed, thus bringing faithfully to completion, the great aim of this treatise.
Treatment of Diseases included here
291. Those diseases that have not been described here as they have various names and forms, should be treated as indicated herein, from the point of view of humoral classification.
292. Whatever is the opposite of the morbid humor, affected body-element and etiological factor, is definitely beneficial. Treatment, if done properly according to this principle, cures all the diseases described herein and also those not described.
293. The remedy should be prescribed with full consideration to dime and season and dosage and the homologation or non-homologation. Else the most wholesome medication may turn out to be harmful.
294.In disease of the stomach, the medicine administered by the mouth; in diseases of the head, nasal medications; and in diseases affecting the colon, the medication given by the rectum, act most readily.
295. In local diseased arising in the various regions of the body and in acute spreading affection and pimples and similar lesions, local applications suitable to the part affected will prove specially efficacious.
296. The term ‘Time’ is used in medicine with reference to the day, the patient, medication, signs of completion of digestion and season. As regards time with reference to day, morning is the suitable time for giving emesis.
297. With reference to the patient, the strong patient may take the medicine in the morning on an empty stomach and the. weak one should take the medicine mixed with light and wholesome food.
298. As regards the time of medication, it is before the first meal or in the midst of meals or after meals, or at repeated times, or in the beginning of each meal or mixed with light food or mixed with regular meals, or in between two morsels of food.
299-301. These are the ten different times when medicine may be taken. In discordance of the Apana Vata, medicine should be taken before meal; and in the discordance of the Samana Vata it should be taken in the middle of the meal and in the discordance of the Vyana-Vata, medicine should be taken after the morning-meal in the discordance of the Udana-Vata. after the meals, while in the discordance of the Prana-Vata, it should be taken in between the morsels. In dyspnea, cough and thirst, medicine should be given frequently at short intervals, and in hiccup, it should be given both before and at the end of the meal mixed with light articles of diet; and in anorexia, it should be given mixed with food abounding in variety.
302. In the case of fever, gruels, decoctions, milk, ghee and purgatives should be given after the lapse of six days, after observing the time of the disease.
303. The signs of completion of digestion are the appearance of hunger, normal discharge of excretions, lightness of the body and clarity of the eructations. Medicine should be given at this stage. Otherwise it will be harmful.
304. The accumulation of humoral morbidity, what are contra-indicated and what are indicated In a given season, what measures are recommended in each season, have all been already described.
305. The application of treatment, the reasons for the avoidance of treatment and manner of investigation of minutia of morbid changes in weak [? people?], has already been described.
306. The physician who keeps on observing repeatedly, the development of diseases and the condition of the patient, will not err in treatment.
307. The medication administered without carefully investigating the six points regarding the time of medication, just described, will be harmful to the patient, like unseasonal rains to crops.
Time and Disease
308.A few more considerations with reference to time, as with reference to diseases, season, period of day and night, age of the patient and before or after or during meals-time will now be described.
309.In the spring, there generally occur diseases of Kapha and in the autumn those of Pitta, in the rainy season, those of Vata.
310. At the end of the night, day and the rainy season, there generally occur diseases of Vata. In the mornings and the beginning of night, diseases of Kapha such as sneezing etc., and in the middle of the day and the night diseases born of Pitta occur.
311.With regard to age, in old, middle and early age, there generally occur disorders of Vata, Pitta and Kapha respectively, or they become severe aided by the natural effects of the age of the person.
312. At the end of digestion the diseases of Vata; during the stage of digestion the diseases of Pitta; and just after meals diseases born of Kapha, generally become aggravated.
313-314. An under-dose of medication cannot cure the disease just as a small quantity of water cannot quench a great fire; and medicine given in over-dose will prove harmful just as excessive watering harms the crops. So, after carefully considering the severity of the disease and the strength of the medication, the physician should administer it, neither in too large a dose nor in too small a dose.
315. A patient feels uncomfortable by the sudden withdrawal from even an unwholesome habit which has become homologatory to him by habitual use or as the result of climatic conditions.
Habits of various People
316-319½. The Bahlikas, the Pahlavas, the Chinese, the Shulikas, the Greeks and the Shakas are habituated to flesh, wheat, Madhvika wine, bearing arms and to fire. The easterners are habituated to fish and the people of Sind are used to milk. The people of Ashmaka and Avantika are habituated to the use of oil and acid articles while the people of Malaya are habituated to roots, bulbs and fruits. To the people of the South, thin gruel is homologous; to the people of the north-west, demulcent drink is homologous. In the central country people have homologation to barley, wheat and cow’s milk and its products. To these peoples, medications combined with these articles of homologation must be given, for, the thing which is homologous, promotes strength immediately, and even if given in excess, does not produce any marked harmful effects.
320-320½. Though treating with the right prescriptions, yet if the physician be ignorant of the knowledge of place etc, he cannot achieve success in treatment. There exist many differences in the nature of men as regards age, vitality, constitution etc.
321-321½. In conditions where the morbidity has affected the deeper tissues and affected the internal spaces of the body and the joints, the physician may have to adopt the procedure which is generally considered contrary to the usual mode of treatment.
322-322½. The Pitta which is penetrated inside and is lying deep is eliminated by sudation, hot affusion and hot poultices. Thus heat is subdued by heat.
323-323½. By the external application of cold things such as affusion etc., the external heat, being pressed, passes internally; and this heat going internally destroys internal Kapha. Thus cold too is subdued by cold.
324-324½.. (External application of cold articles causes contraction of peripheral vessels and so, more blood is collected in the central organs). Thus the thick application of very finely ground sandal acts as calorific though sandal is of the cold potency, by obstructing the evaporation of heat from the skin; while the thin application of coarsely ground eaglewood acts as refrigerant though it is of the hot potency.
325-325½. Excretion of the fly is anti-emetic while the whole fly is emetic. In all articles subjected to either physical heat or to the digestive heat there may occur similar contrary actions.
326-326½. Therefore the wise physician should do the treatment after carefully examining the morbidity and the remedies from the ten-points of view described previously. He should not depend entirely on the literal formula of drugs.
327-327½. After the subsidence of the disease, recurrence may be brought about by even a slight cause. As the condition of the body is weak and the path for the spread of the disease is already made, the slightest residue of morbidity may flare up like fire.
328-328½.- Thereafter, the body should be rendered immune by a mild or.safe course of the effective remedies which have been used and found efficacious in the disease.
329-329½. The humors, greatly provoked internally by excessive accumulation or deficiency, can be rendered mild by recourse to wholesome regimen; and consequently they manifest only mild morbid effects.
330-330½. Finding that in spite of taking the wholesome regimen, the disease occurs, the physician should increase either the quantity of or the length of the course of the wholesome regimen
331-331½. Owing to constant use or to unpalatableness, the wholesome regimen becomes repulsive; it should be rendered palatable by various modes of preparation.
332-332½. By its being agreeable:o the mind and the senses, it produces a sense of satisfaction, it increases good spirits, relish, vitality, sense of happiness and enjoyment. Hence the strength of the disease gets diminished.
333-333½. The medications which are wholesome should be of the taste which the patient has acquired by constant indulgence, which are developed owing to deficiency of the corresponding body-element, or which are developed as a reaction to disease. And the diet also should be cooked by suitable methods of preparation.
Summary
Here are the recapitulatory verses—
334-334½. The twenty gynecic disorders, the etiology, signs and symptoms and their therapeutics have been explained, for the benefit of the disciples.
335-336. So too the causes, symptoms and treatment of the eight kinds of seminal morbidity, the four kinds of impotency and the four kinds of colporrhea, their etiology, characteristics and treatment have all been described.
337. Also the eight kinds of galactic morbidity with their causes, characteristics and remedies, and the signs of the purity of semen and the menses, have also been described.
338-339. The diseases which have been mentioned here as well as those not mentioned and the proper line of treatment for them; the time of medication with reference to six factors, what is homologatory to which clime; and how the physician commits mistakes owing to ignorance of these, and also the description, and the treatment of deep-seated morbidity, have all been expounded here.
340. He who knows not thoroughly the science and its full interpretation should not venture on treatment, even as a blind man should not try to paint a picture.
30. Thus, in the Section on Therapeutics in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the thirtieth chapter entitled ‘The Therapeutics of the Gynecic Disorders [yoni-vyapad-cikitsa]’ not being available, the same as restored by Dridhabala, is completed.
341.Thus ends the Section on Therapeutics which forms the Sixth Section in the Treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka.
Synopsis of the [Kalpasthana]
3. It is indeed, O Agnivesha! for the following reasons that we expound the Section on Pharmaceutics [kalpa-sthana] namely, to describe the combination with various drags that render the preparation most pleasant to take for the purpose of emesis and purgation; to describe the classifications and dosage of these emetic and purgative drugs, as also to describe the easy and proper pharmaceutical procedures of these preparations.
The Methods of Purgation
4. Of these the act or action of expelling the impurities through the upper channel is known as Emesis, while that of expelling the impurities through the lower channel is known as Purgation. Both being processes of cleansing the bodily impurities, they are known by the common term purgation.
5-(1). The drugs that are hot, acute, subtle, diffusive and anti spasmodic, reaching the heart by virtue of their potency, and circulating through the large and small blood vessels, pervade the entire body. They liquefy the accumulated, morbid matter therein by virtue of their fiery quality and break it up by their acuteness.
5. This morbid matter being thus broken up and floating in the body, that has undergone oleation procedure, remains detached in the body like honey kept in a pot smeared with ghee; and being drawn by its atomic affinity, it flows towards the gastrointestinal tract and getting propelled upwards by the Udana Vata, the morbid matter gets thrown upwards as a result of the fiery and the airy quality as well as by the upward flowing tendency of the drugs. Owing to the watery and earthy qualities and the downward flowing tendency of drugs, it purges downwards. Where both the qualities are combined, it purges both ways. Thus have been described ‘The characteristics of the purgative drugs’.
Six hundred Purgative Preparations
6. Taking into consideration that drugs differ with respect to land, season, source, flavor, taste, potency, post-digestive effect and specification, and also that men differ with respect to their body, morbid tendency, constitution, age, vitality, gastric fire, proclivities, homologation and stage of disease, we shall here describe Six hundred purgative preparations that are pleasant in their variety of smell, color, taste and touch; of drugs such as emetic nut, Bristly luffa, Bottle gourd, sponge gourd, kurchi, bitter luffa, black turpeth, turpeth, purging cassia, tilwaka, thorny milk-hedge plant, soap pod, clenolipis, red physic nut and physic nut, although the extent of the possible preparations from these drugs is innumerable.
7. These drugs become most effective in action by the richness of the factors of favourable place, season, quality of storage-vessels and the process of cynamization.
The Varieties of Land
8-(1). ‘Place or clime’ is of three kinds—Jangala (arid) land, wet-land and ordinary laud. Of them the Jangala land is that which is abounding in open space. It contains dense forests of gum arabic tree, catechu tree, spinous kino tree, sal, crane tree, oojein tree, Indian olibenum [olibanum?], Indian sal, small jujube, false mangosteen, holy fig, banyan and emblic myrobalan. There grow the Shami, Arjuna and rose wood trees in large number. There, the young branches dance swayed by the force of continuous dry winds; it abounds in thin, rough and hard hand and gravel hidden often by the sight of mirages. It is inhabited by quails, partridges and Cakora birds. There the Vata and Pitta humors are in predominance and people are well-knit and hardy.
8-(2). The wet-land is that which contains dense forests and marshes, date plants, Tamala, coconuts and plantain trees, which is generally bounded by rivers or the sea, where cold winds blow greatly, which is in the neighbourhood of rivers whose banks are rendered beautiful by reeds and rush, which is abounding in hills covered with creeping shrubs, where clusters of trees wave to gentle breezes, which contains many forests of blooming rows of trees, which is covered with densely grown trees and creepers, where the branches of trees are echoing to the cries of birds like the swan, the Cakravaka, the crane, the Nandimukha, the Pundarika, the Kadamba, the Madgu, the Bhringaraja, the Shatapatra and the inebriate cukoo, and where the people are delicate in looks and of Vata and Kapha constitutions generally.
8. That place should be known as ordinary country which contains the trees, herbs and shrubs, birds and hearts of both the aforesaid types of land, which is inhabited by people endowed with firmness, delicacy, strength, color, well-knit frames and average qualities.
9. Of them the herbs that grow in the ordinary or Jangala land, which are subject to normal seasonal cold, sun, wind and rain, which have grown on level and clean ground with water on its right side, where the burial ground, sacred tombs, places of sacrifice to gods, place of assembly, pits, pleasure gar dens, and ant-hills and saline soils are not in the neighbourhood, where the sacred and the ginger grasses grow, whose earth is black and sweet or golden and sweet, which has not been ploughed up or in any way damaged or devastated by strong trees growing over it, the drugs growing in such land are commended as good.
The Culling of Drugs
10. Of them, such drugs should be culled as were put forth in their proper season and have attained their fullness of growth, taste, potency and smell, whose smell, color, taste, touch aud specific action have not been impaired by season, sun-heat, fire, water, wind or insects and which are fully mature and growing on the northern side. Of them again the branches and leaves which have recently grown should be gathered between the rainy seasoned the spring. The roots should be gathered in the summer or in the winter, from trees whose ripened leaves have been shed; the bark, bulb and milk of plants in the autumn and the pith at the end of autumn (Hemanta), and the flowers and fruit in their proper season. After performing auspicious rites, living a pure life, having performed the purificatory bath, wearing white raiment, having worshipped the gods, the Ashwin twins, the cows and Brahmanas, having observed a fast and facing the east or the north, one should cull these drugs.
Preservation and potency etc.
11. Having thus been culled and placed in suitable vessels, they should be stored in houses with doors opening to the east or the north, in a room which is windless except for one window, in a house where every day flower-offering and sacrifice are observed and which is proof against fire, water, moisture, smoke, dust, mice and quadrupeds. The vessel should be well covered and kept securely tied in swings.
12-(l). These should be administered according to the morbid humor. They should be given with Sura, Sauviraka, Tushodaka, Maireya and Medaka wines, sour-gruel, sour fruit-juice, sour curds etc., in condition of Vata; in condition of Pitta with grape, emblic myrobalans, honey, liquorice, sweet falsah, liquid gur, milk etc.; and in condition of Kapha, they should be impregnated and mixed with honey, cow’s urine and decoctions curative of Kapha etc. Thus, has the subject been described in brief.
12. The same, shall we now describe in extenso, under the divisions of drugs, constitution, morbidity homologation etc.
Best among Emetics
13-(1). The emetic nut [madana] is regarded as the best of emetic drugs as its administration is attended with no risks. It should be culled between the spring and the summer under the constellation of Pushya, Ashvini twins, or the Mrgashirsha during the auspicious hour of the Maitra Muhurta.
13-(2). Such of the fruits as are ripe, as are not perforated, as are not green but are yellowish, as are neither touched by worms, nor rotten nor bitten by insects, nor small in size should be gathered, cleansed and bundled up in sacred grass, smeared with cow-dung and kept for eight nights in a heap of barley husk, black gram, rice, horse gram or green gram.
13. Afterwards, when they have become soft, sweet and pleasant-smelling, they should be taken and dried. When they are well dried, their seeds should be taken out. They should be crushed with ghee, curds, honey and til-paste and dried again. Then they should be filled to the neck in a new pot which is clean and free from sand or dust, well closed with a lid, well protected and placed securely in a swing.
14-(1). The patient to whom emesis is to be administered should be subjected to to the oleation and sudation procedures for two or three days. His Kapha should then be roused up the day previous to the administration of emesis, by a diet of the meat-juice of domestic wet-land and aquatic creatures, milk, curds, black gram, til, vegetables etc. In the morning, when the food taken in the previous night has been fully digested and the Kapha has been well precipitated, after he has performed sacrifice, poured libation of ghee into the fire, done auspicious and purificatory rites and has taken a potion of barley soup mixed slightly with unctuous articles along with a dose of ghee and without taking any solid diet, he should be given the emetic potion in the following manner. Take a fistful of the emetic nut seeds and crushing them as much as is necessary for the purpose, soak them in the decoction of liquorice, variegated mountain ebony, white mountain ebony, cadamba, hijjal tree, scarlet-fruit gourd flax hemp, mudar, or rough chaff tree. It should be kept overnight; it should then be rubbed and strained, mixed with honey and rock salt, warmed to a genial degree and filled in a measure pot with the following holy verse chanted over it: “Om, may Brahma, Daksha, Ashvins, Rudra, Indra, the Earth, the Moon, the Sun, the gods of the wind, the fire, the sages, the host of drugs and all living creat [? beings?] protect thee. Even as the vitalizers are to the sages, and ambrosia to the gods, as nectar is to the best of the Nagas, so may this medicine be unto thee’. Having thus sanctified the potion, the patient with his face turned to the east or the north must be made to drink again and again and vomit until the bile is seen to come out especially in persons afflicted with fever of the Kapha type, Gulma or coryza. This is the proper method of the procedure of Emesis.
14. If the urge be weak in the patient, it should be augmented by repeated administration of the paste of long pepper, emblic myrobalan, rape-seed and sweet flag as also rock salt and hot water until the appearance of bile in the vomit. This is the method of administration of all kinds of emetic preparations.
15. In all emetic preparations, honey and rock-salt must be added in order to liquefy and segregate the Kapha in the body. The honey used in emetic preparations does not become incompatible with heat, as it is thrown out undigested and as it helps the elimination of the morbid matter,
Preparations of Pills etc.

5. The fruits of the clenolepis [shankhini] should be gathered before they are very dry, and excorticated. The roots of soap-pod [saptala] should be gathered and both these should be preserved in a pot.
Various preparations
6-8- A measure of one tola of the paste of these drugs mixed with Prasanna wine and rock-salt should be administered in cardiac disorder caused by Kapha and Vata, and also in Gulma. This paste administered with the decoctions of Buchanan’s mango, tooth brush tree, wild jujube, small jujube, Indian hog-plum, pomegranate, grape, jack fruit, date, sour jujube, sweet falsah or with Maireya wine, sour whey, Sauviraka wine, Tushodaka wine, or Sidhu wine, acts as a quick and easeful purgative.
9-9½. The oil cooked in the milk prepared with the drugs of the ticktrefoil group, with the paste of soap-pod and clenolepis and half its quantity of the paste of turpeth and black turpeth, should be administered as potion along with whey.
10-11. Taking the powder of clenolepis two parts and one part of the powder of til, oil should be expressed out of that. This should be taken with the decoction of chebulic myrobalans, The same is the process in the case of linseed, rapeseed, castor and Indian beech.
12-12½. A medicated ghee should be prepared by taking the ghee obtained from the milk prepared with clenolepis and soap-pod in four parts the quantity of milk and the paste of the same two drugs as well as the same quantity of the. paste of turpeth and black turpeth. This should be taken as a purgative potion.
13-14½. The same is the process in the preparation of medicated ghee in the case of red physic nut and physic nut, shell and wild carrot, yellow milk plant and indigo plant, Indian beech, and jungle cork tree as also in the case of lentil and kidney-leaved ipomea. Again, taking half part of the paste of each of this dyad of drugs a medicated ghee may be prepared.
15.Prepare a medicated ghee with the decoction of clenolepis, soap-pod and emblic myrobalans.
16.One preparation of ghee can he made as in the case of turpeth; and three linctuses as in the case of lodh. One preparation in Sura wine and one with kamala may be made in the same manner as lodh.
17. In the same pharmaceutical process as red physic nut and physic nut, these can be prepared in Sauviraka and Tushodaka wines. Similarly they can be prepared in the decoction of wild carrot and shell for the purpose of purgation.
Summary
Here are the two recapitulatory verses—
18-19. Sixteen preparations of decoctions, six preparations in oil, eight in ghee, five in wine, three preparations of linctuses and one preparation with kamala, thus, in all, thirty-nine tested preparations are there of soap-pod and clenolepis used in combination. They (soap-pod and clenolepis) are beneficial, used either together or even singly.
11.Thus, in the Section on Pharmaceutics in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the eleventh chapter entitled ‘The Pharmaceutics of the Soap-pod and Clenolepis [saptalā-śaṅkhinī-kalpa—saptala-shankhini-kalpa]’ not being available, the same as restored by Dridhabala, is completed.

[Cf. Next chapters]
Resume of the Section
Here are the two recapitulatory verses—
108-107. The purpose of Pharmaceutics; the definition of the purificatory procedures; different aims in the use of each procedure; the qualities of clime etc., the qualities of emetic nut etc., and six hundred preparations; the purpose and the names of preparations and the characteristics of the strong, moderate and the mild types of preparations; the procedure with reference to the stage of disease, the table of measures and the method of preparation of unctuous articles—all this has been described herein.
12. Thus, in the Section on Pharmaceutics, in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the twelfth chapter entitled ‘The Pharmaceutics of the Red Physic nut [dantī-danti] and the Physic nut [dravantī—dravanti]’ not being available, the same as restored by Dridhabala, is completed.
Relative measures [mana] of Liquids and Solids
98-99. Double the measure [mana] is meant when mentioned with reference to fluids and freshly culled herbs. But where the measure is described in terms of a Tula or a Pala, the measure should be literally understood. Where the relative measures of things are not specified, an equal measure is implied.
100. In making fluid preparations, where the liquid is not specified, water is implied in all such preparations. Where a quarter is mentioned, it should be known as one fourth part with reference to the main drug.
101. In the making of unctuous preparations, where the measures of water, unctuous article and drug are not specified, the unctuous article is implied to be four times the drug, and water four times the unctuous article.
102-103. Unctuous preparations are, it should be known, of three kinds:—soft, medium and hard. When the solution of the drugs acquires the consistency of the paste added to it, it is known as a ‘soft preparation’. When the solution acquires the consistency of a jelly and can be poured out easily with the ladle, it is considered ‘medium preparation.’ When the solution becomes so thickened that it snaps, and can be rolled between the fingers, it is called ‘hard preparation’.
104. It should be known that the hard preparation should be used for inunction, the soft one for nasal medication and the medium preparation should be used as potion and in the preparation of enemata.
Two types of Measure [mana]
105. The standard of measurement [mana] is said to be of two kinds, viz,, Kalinga and Magadha. Mensural experts regard the Magadha standard to be superior to the Kalinga.
Agnivesha’s Inquiry
3-5½. “What is the method laid down in the five purificatory procedures? What is the order in which they are to be performed? What are the signs of successful and unsuccessful administration of the purificatory procedures, as also of over-administration? What is the number of enemata to be given? What is the therapeutic value of enema? What kind of enema should be given in which condition? What is to be avoided during the period of treatment? What is the period of interval to be observed between the administration of various purificatory procedures? What are the causes preventing the successful operation of an enema? What makes for the immediate return of the enema fluid? What again causes its delayed return? Why is it that some diseases, although curable, are not allayed in spite of being treated by appropriate measures?”
Thus questioned fully by the foremost of his pupils—Agnivesha, Punarvasu, the foremost of physicians and highly learned in the Science moved by the desire of prompting the welfare of the whole of humanity, answered and said to him thus.
6-6½. It is prescribed that the person should be subjected to sudation therapy after he has undergone oleation therapy for a minimum period of three days or a maximum period of seven days. Oleation therapy for longer than this period is not recommended, as the patient then gets habituated to it.
7-7½. Oleation cures the morbidity of Vata, makes the body soft and disintegrates the accumulation of morbid matter, while sudation liquefies the morbid matter which is stuck up in the minute channels of the body of the person who has undergone oleation therapy.
8-8¼. The person who is to be subjected to emesis should have his Kapha in the stomach roused up by a diet of milk mixed with meat juice and the flesh of domestic, aquatic aud wet-land animals. The person who is to be administered purgation should be given the meat-juice of Jangala animals, soups mixed with unctuous articles and articles non-promotive of Kapha.
9-9½. The person in whom the Kapha is in excess vomits easily and the person in whom it is low purges well. If the Kapha is meagre, the emetic drug acts as a purgative while in a condition of excess of Kapha, the purgative drug acts as an emetic.
10-10½. Emesis should be administered, in the manner laid down to one that has taken the oleation therapy, and when the emesis has been complete, the patient should be given the systematic dietetic regimen by means of gruels etc. The person who has undergone the oleation and sudation procedures should be administered the best suited purgative, as laid down.
11-11½. The person who has been thus purged should take thin and thick gruel, unseasoned and seasoned soup and meatjuice, in the order mentioned. lie should take each of these at the three meal times or at two meals, or at one meal time according as the purificatory dose was maximum, moderate or minimum.
12-12½. Just as a spark of fire fed gradually by straw and cow-dung cakes etc., grows into a big and constant flame, similarly, the internal gastric fire in the person who has undergone the purificatory procedure, grows strong and constant and capable of digesting all foods, fed gradually by gruels etc.
13-13½. Four, six and eight times of vomiting are considered good as minimum, moderate and, maximum action respectively, and similarly are regarded in purgation, ten, twenty and thirty times. The quantity of fecal matter should be 128, 192 or 256 tolas.
14-14½. The quantity of vomited matter should be half of this, and that vomit should be considered successful which is accompanied with bile in the last phase and likewise the purgation which is accompanied with mucus or Kapha in the last phase. In case of fecal matter, the quantity passed should be measured without taking Into account the quantity passed in the first two or three motions: and in the measurement of the quantity of vomitus the quantity of the drug in the vomitus should not be counted.
Symptoms of Right, Under and Over Action of Emesis and Purgation
15-15½. He is considered to have undergone emesis successfully who expels the mucus, bile and air in succession and who feels that his stomach, sides of the body, sense organs and body-channels have been cleansed and that his body has become light.
16-16½. If the emesis goes wrong, then there occur eruptions, wheals and itching on the body, imperfect cleansing of the stomach and body-channels and heaviness of the limbs. Thirst, stupor,Tainting, provocation bi Vata, loss of sleep and loss of strength etc, occur in case of over-action of emesis.
17-17½ Purification of the alimentary tract, clarity of the senses, lightness of the body, stimulation of the gastric fire, a sense of well-being and passing of feces, bile, mucus and wind in succession in his motions are the signs of successful purgation.
18-18½. In a condition where purgation has acted amiss, there will be great provocation of Kapha, Pitta and Vata, exhaustion, dullness of the gastric fire, heaviness of body, coryza, torpor, vomiting, anorexia and the absence of regular peristaltic movement of the Vata.
19-19½. In a condition of excessive action of purgation, there will occur numbness, body-ache, exhaustion, tremors and other symptoms born of Vata which becomes provoked owing to loss of mucus, blood and bile in the motions as also torpor, loss of vitality, faintness, mental disturbance and hiccup.
All about Enemata
20. Then after the rehabilitation of the patient by means of diet, he should be given on the ninth day a potion of ghee or unctuous enema.
21. Three days after that the patient who had his body well anointed with oil and is not very hungry should be given evacuative enema when the enema fluid has returned he should be given the meat-juice of Jangala animals or any other suitable diet according to his humoral constitution and the strength of the gastric fire.
21½. Then, the person who is to be administered the unctuous enema should be given the enema at night, care being taken to see that he has not eaten a heavy meat
22-22½. In the winter and the spring, the unctuous enema should be given by day and in the autumn, summer and the rains, it should be given at night, with due care to prevent the wrongful effects of the oleation therapy, which have been already described. (Chap. XIII Sutra).
23-24. After the unctuous fluid has returned, the person who has taken the unctuous enema and has spent the night quietly should be given food during the day and also in the evening. Thereafter, he is to be given unctuous enema on the second, third or fifth day. After giving the evacuative enema on every third or fifth day, he should be given the unctuous enema.
25. In disorders of Kapha, one enema or three enemata should be given; in disorders of Pitta, five, or while in disorders of Vata, nine or even eleven should be given. In this way the expert physician should give enemata in odd numbers.
26. The person who has undergone purgation should definitely avoid taking evacuative enema for a period of seven days. Similarly, the person who has been cleansed by evacuative enema should avoid purgation as it will have injurious effects on the system which has already been evacuated.
27. The enema is an agent, of rejuvenation, and promoter of happiness, life, strength, gastric fire, intelligence, voice and color. It is beneficial in every way for all, whether young, adult or aged. It is free from risks, and cures all diseases.
28. It draws out the feces, mucus, bile, flatus and urine, and imparts firmness and enriches the semen and body strength. The evacuative enema expelling the morbid accumulations lodged in the entire body alleviates all kinds of diseases.
29. When the body-channels have been cleansed by the evacuative enema, oleation imparts color and strength to the body. There is no remedy more beneficial than the administration of oil, particularly in afflictions, of Vata.
30. Oil by its unctuous counteracts the dryness, by its heaviness counteracts the lightness and by its heat the quality of coldness due to Vata and thus quickly imparts clarity of mind, virility, strength, color and the increase of the gastric fire.
31. Just as a tree fed with water at its roots, puts forth green leaves and delicate sprouts, and in due time grows into a big tree full of blossom and fruit, similarly does a man grow strong by means of the unctuous enema.
32. Enema is specially indicated in persons whose limbs have become •tiff or contracted, who are suffering from lameness in both legs, who have suffered from fractures and dislocation and who suffer from rheumatic lesions affecting the extremities.
33; Enema is also indicated in distension of abdomen, scybalous stools, colic, inappetence and similar other disorders affecting the gastro-intestinal tract.
34. The enema is considered the sovereign remedy in cases of women who have been afflicted with complications due to Vata, who are not able to conceive despite mating with men, and in the case of persons whose semen is weak and who are emaciated.
35. The wise are of opinion that a cold enema should be given to patients afflicted with excessive heat and a genially warm enema where the patient is afflicted with cold. In this manner, the nature of the enema should generally be determined in all conditions and mixed with drugs possessing the qualities contrary to the characteristics of the disease-condition.
36. The roborant enema should not be administered in disease-conditions indicating depletion therapy, such as dermatosis, urinary disorders etc., as also to men with excessive adiposity who need to be given the purificatory and the depletory treatment.
37. And the evacuative enema should not be given to persons who are cachectic due to pectoral lesions, who are dehydrated, who are extremely debilitated, who are unconscious, and who are already purged as also in conditions where the excretory matter is the only hold for life.
38-39½. There is no cause greater than Vata in the manifestation of diseases affecting the peripheral regions or the alimentary tract or vital organs or the upper part of the body or the whole body or part of the body. Since the Vata is the motive force behind the function of elimination or retention of feces, urine, bile and other excreta in their respective emunctories, there is no remedy other than the enema in the alleviation of Vata that is excessively provoked. It is therefore that some physicians are of the opinion that enema constitutes, half of the treatment, while others hold it to be not half but the whole of treatment.
40-40½. Enema is that which reaching upto the umbilical, iliac, lumbar and hypochondriac regions and churning up the fecal and morbid matter and spreading the unctuous effect in the whole body, draws out the fecal and morbid matter with ease.
41-41½. Elimination of feces, urine and air, increase of the appetite and the gastric fire, lightness of the emunctories and alleviation of ailments and return to health and vitality, are the signs of the successful administration of the evacuative enema.
42-42½. If the evacuative enema has not acted satisfactorily, there will be pain in the head, stomach, rectum, bladder and phallus, edema, coryza, griping pain, nausea, retention of flatus and urine, and dyspnea.
43. The signs of the over-action of the evacuative enema are the same as those produced by the over-action of purgation.
44. The signs of the successful unctuous enema are the return of oil with the fecal matter without being stuck up anywhere, the clarity of blood and other body-elements and intellect and the sense organs, inclination to sleep, lightness of body, increase of vitality and regulation of the excretory urges.
45. The signs of the imperfect action of the unctuous enema are pain in the lower part of the body, abdomen, arms, back and sides of the body, dryness and roughness of the limbs and the retention of feces, urine and flatus.
45½. And the signs of the excessive action of the unctuous enema are nausea, stupor, fatigue, exhaustion, fainting and griping pain.
46-46½. That person’s body is well-purified in whom the unctuous fluid returns after three Yamas; if it returns much earlier, then another enema should be given. If the unctuous enema is not retained, it cannot produce the desired unctuous effect in the body.
47-48½. In the Karma type of procedure, it is laid down that thirty enemata should be given; in the Kala type of procedure half this number should be given; and in the Yoga type procedure the half of the last. In the first procedure, twelve each of the unctuous and evacuative enemata should be given in the middle; one unctuous enema in the beginning and five at the end should he given. In Kala type of procedure, there will be one unctuous enema in the beginning, six each of unctuous and evacuative enemata in the middle, and three unctuous enemata in the end. In Yoga type, of procedures, only three evacuative enemata are to be given and five of unctuous enemata. These latter may be given at any time, that is, either in the beginning, the middle or the end.
49-49½. They say that after giving three, four, five or six unctuous enemata according to the degree of morbid humors i.e., Vata etc., the physician should give evacuative enemata for the purification, of the body-channels.
50-50½. After the body has been purified, the person’s head should be methodically anointed and sweated with the palm of the hand. The physician on ascertaining the degree of intensity of the morbid humors, should give errhine treatment, once, twice or thrice as required.
51-52. In case of successful errhine therapy, there will be lightness of the chest and head, clarity of the senses and purification of the body-channels. If the errhine therapy has acted amiss, there will be mucus-secretions in the throat, heaviness of the head and ptyalism. In over-action of the errhine therapy, there will be aching pain in the head, eyes temple and ear, and faintness. In case of over-action, the remedy consists in the administration of demulcent drinks and soft and fluid medications.
53. In case of under-action, the subject should be given a stronger dose of errhines after preparation with fresh oleation. Thus we have described the courses of the purificatory therapy, which are conducive to the establishment of the health and happiness of the patient, and also which promote the vitality and length of life, and are curative of all diseaseconditions.
53½. The period of post-purificatory regimen is double that of the time occupied by the purificatory therapy.
54-54½. The post purificatory regimen is thus: One should avoid excessive sitting, standing or talking, riding or driving, sleeping by day, sexual intercourse, the suppression of natural urges, indulgence in cold things, sun-heat, worry, anger and untimely and unwholesome food
55-55½. In cases where the enema tube is clogged or held obliquely, or where the rectal passage is blocked by piles, mucus or hard stools, or where the enema solution, owing to insufficiency of its quantity or strength is powerless to break through the obstruction of morbid matter, the enema does not succeed in reaching its destination or even if it does, it does not return in time or with ease.
56-56½. In conditions where there is sudden urge for voiding feces, flatus, or urine, or where there is excessive increase of Vata, or where the enema fluid is excessively hot and pungent, or the person is of the soft-bowelled type, the enema returns immediately after being injected.
Whichever of the Curable Diseases do not get cured
57-57½. The Vata being obstructed by accumulations of fat or of mucus, gives rise to colic, numbness of the limbs and edema. The ignorant physician giving an unctuous enema in such conditions, will only further aggravate those very conditions.
58-58½. Similarly, other disorders which overlap each other in their courses and get mixed up with the morbidity of other body-elements and consequently prove difficult for diagnosis, fail to yield to the specific remedies.
59-59½. All therapeutic measures designed to alleviate disease, however wholesome and however skilfully given, fail to bring about the alleviation of disease, if they are used either in insufficient or excessive measure or at the wrong time or in the wrong manner.
Summary
Here is the recapitulatory verse—
60-60½. The worshipful son of Atri, the foremost of sages, in this chapter on the successful application of various therapeutic measures, declared fully for the good of the people, the answers to twelve questions of great significance concerning the five purificatory procedures.
1. Thus, in the Section on Success in Treatment in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the first chapter entitled ‘The Successful Application of the Various Therapeutic Measures[kalpana-siddhi]’ not being available, the same as restored by Dridhabala, is completed.
Subjects Fit and Unfit for the Procedures
4-7. The man that is fierce, rash, cowardly, ungrateful or fickle, who is a hater of good persons, kings and physicians or he who is hated by them or he who is afflicted with grief, or is a fatalist or one doomed to death, one who is devoid of the means for treatment or an enemy, impostor or one devoid of faith, a confirmed sceptic or who does not carry out the directions of the physician—such a man should. not be taken up, by a wise physician, for treatment. The physician who treats such cases invites many difficulties upon himself. Persons other than such should be treated well with all modes of treatment. Classifying the various morbid conditions, we shall now describe the indications and the contra-indications of the five purificatory procedures with reference to them.
8. The following are the conditions where emesis is contra-indicated:—persons afflicted with pectoral lesions, those who are cachectic, very obese or extremely emaciated, who are infants, senile, debilitated, fatigued, thirsty or hungry, those who are exhausted by labour, load-lifting and way-faring, or those given to fasting, sexual excess, study, exercise and thinking, or those that are emaciated, pregnant women and delicate persons, or those whose alimentary tract is contracted, who do not react to emetics easily or who suffer from hemothermia of the upper region, or from incessant vomiting or from disorders of the upward flow of morbid Vata, or who take often evacuative or unctuous enemata, who are suffering from cardiac disorders, misperistalsis, lesions of the urinary tract, splenic disorder, Gulma, abdominal diseases, prostatic enlargement, impairment of voice, and faintness, or are afflicted with pain in the head, temples, ears and eyes.
9-(1). In condition of pulmonary lesions, owing to further strain due to vomiting, there will be profuse hemorrhage. In persons who are cachectic, very obese, emaciated, young, old, or weak, there will be danger to life owing to their inability to tolerate the action of medication, and similarly will be affected those who are fatigued, thirsty and hungry. In persons broken down by constant labour, loadlifting and way-faring, and those weakened by constant fasting, sexual indulgence, study, exercise and thinking, owing to their ununctuous condition there will be Vata-provocation, hemorrhage, or ulceration; in cases of gravida, there may be [? complications?] of pregnancy, abortion of the immature fetus and the incidence of severe diseases. In the case of delicate persons, consequent upon the strain on the stomach, there may be excessive hemorrhage through the upper or lower channels. In the case of persons whose alimentary tract is contracted or who do not easily react to emetics, the flux of morbid matter roused but not eliminated, accumulates in the alimentary tract aud causes internally acute spreading affections, stasis, dullness, fainting or even death. In patients with hemothermia affecting the upper region.it may provoke the Udana Vata and take away the life or cause profuse bleeding. In the case of persons afflicted with incessant vomiting, similar are the effects. In condition of upward movement of Vata and in persons who have taken corrective or unctuous enema, there will be augmentation of the upward movement of Vata. In persons suffering from cardiac disorders there will be impairment of the Cardiac function. In cases of misperistalsis, there will be aggravation of the condition which may quickly cause death. Persons afflicted with the lesions in the urinary tract and similar other conditions, there will be manifestation of more acute pain. laypersons suffering from fainting there will be great aggravation. In cases of aches in the head etc, there will be great intensification of pain. Therefore, emesis is contra-indicated in such persons.
9. Even in all these conditions, emesis is not prohibited if the person is afflicted with acute or chronic poisoning, antagonistic diet, indigestion, predigestion meal and chyme morbidity, as these conditions are very quick in their toxic effect on the body.
10. Emesis is indicated in all other conditions and specially in persons Buffering from coryza, dermatosis, recent fever, consumption, cough, dyspnea, spasm of the throat, deradenoncus, elephantiasis, urinary disorders, weakness of gastric fire, antagonistic diet, indigestion, acute intestinal irritation; intestinal torpor, acute poisoning, chronic poisoning, poisonous bites or licks or stings; hemothermia affecting the lower region, ptyalism, (piles), nausea, anorexia, indigestion, scrofula, epilepsy, insanity, diarrhea, edema, anemia, stomatitis, galactic disorders and disorders of Kapha specially, mentioned in the chapter on nomenclature of disorders (Chap. XX Sūtra); in all these conditions, emesis is considered the foremost of treatment and it acts like the breaking of the bund of the paddy field so that the paddy and other crops are saved from the harm of getting over-watered
11. The conditions in which purgation is contra-indicated are delicate constitutions or ulceration of rectum, or prolapse of rectum or hemothermia affecting the lower region or excessive fasting or weakness of the sense, dullness of gastric fire, or persons who have taken evacuative enema or are agitated by passions or those afflicted with indigestion, recent fever, alcoholism, distension of abdomen, foreign body, injury, over-unctuousness, over-dehydratedness, hard-bowelled condition and group of conditions beginning with pectoral lesions and ending with gravida described in the previous paragraph.
12. A preson living in luxury will suffer, from the same disorders as delicate people. In presons of ulcerated rectum there will be very distressing pain in the lesions of the rectum which may cause danger to life, and in case of prolapse of rectum, it may cause death owing to over-action of the bowels. In case of hemothermia affecting the lower region similar result will be produced. The persons who have undergone lightening therapy, those whose senses have become debilitated or whose digestive fire is dull or those who have taken evacuative enema, will not be able to tolerate the action of medication. In case of persons whose minds are agitated by sexual passion and similar other sentiments, either there will be no effect of purgation or there will be some effect of purgation with great difficulty. In these cases there will be harmful effects of the imperfect action of purgation. In cases of indigestion there will be disorders of chyme. In case of persons with recent fever, purgation will not be able to eliminate the toxic matter which is yet immature but will rather provoke the Vata. In case of emaciation due to alcoholism in one addicted to alcohol, the provoked Vata may endanger life. In a condition of meteorism, the Vata getting accumulated in the colon and increasing the distension, begins to spread and causes tympanitis of a severe and sudden type or may cause even death. The Vata lodged in the wounds or ulcers caused by a foreign body or by trauma, may destroy the life. In persons who have taken excess of oleation therapy, there is the likelihood of over-action of the purgative medication. In case of a dehydrated or un-unctuous person, it will cause spasticity of the limbs. In the case of a hard-bowelled person, the morbid matter, being roused up but not fully eliminated, causes cardiac pain, joint-pain, constipation, bodyache, vomiting, fainting and prostration and may even cause death. In persons suffering from the group of disorders beginning with pectoral lesions aud ending with the conditions of gravida, there will be the same evil effects as described in emesis. Therefore purgation is contraindicated in these cases.
13. In all others purgation is indicated, and especially in those suffering from dermatosis, fever, urinary disorders, hemothermia affecting the upper part, fistula-in-ano, abdominal diseases, piles, inguinal swelling, splenic disorders, Gulma, malignant tumors, deradenoncus, tumors, acute intestinal irritation, intestinal torpor, lesions in the urinary tract, intestinal worms, acute spreading affections, anemia, headache and pleurodynia, misperistalsis, burning in the eyes and mouth, cardiac disorders, fleshy mole and bluish black moles, excessive discharge from the eyes, nose and mouth, Halimaka jaundice, dyspnea, cough, scrofula, epilepsy, insanity, rheumatic conditions, gynecic and seminal disorders, faintness, anorexia, indigestion, vomiting, edema, leucorrhea, eruptions and similar conditions and specially in disorders of Pitta enumerated in the chapter on the nomenclature of diseases (Chap. XX Sutra). In these cases purgation is the foremost treatment, just as the quenching of the fire is the first thing to do when a house is on fire.
14. The conditions where corrective enema is contra-indicated are—the condition of indigestion, over-unctuous conditions of the body or over-dose of oleation, a highly roused condition of the humors, weakness of the gastric fire, exhaustion due to riding, excessive weakness, affliction due to hunger, thirst and fatigue, excessive emaciation, also just after a meal or a drink of water, immediately after emesis, purgation, errhination, in condition of anger, fright, intoxication, fainting, incessant vomiting, ptyalism, dyspnea, cough, hiccup, the condition of intestinal obstruction or perforation, ascites, meteorism, intestinal torpor, acute intestinal irritation, miscarriage, enteric, diarrhea, diabetes and dermatosis.
15. Now, in condition of indigestion or over-unctuous condition or of overdose of oleation, there may occur abdominal diseases of the tridiscordance type, fainting or edema. In provoked condition of the humors in the stomach and in weakness of the gastric fire, there will be severe anorexia. In a condition of exhaustion due to riding, the enema, causing agitation of the system, brings about emaciation of the body. In conditions of great debility, hunger, thirst and fatigue, the same disorders occur as described before. In a condition of extreme emaciation, the condition will be further aggravated. In the case of enema taken immediately after food or a potion of water, the Vata, getting provoked throws put the enema-fluid upwards or downwards and produces serious disorders. In the case of the enema given following upon emesis or purgation, the evacuative enema would burn the dehydrated body as if cauterized with caustic. In the cage of persons who have taken errhine therapy, it will cause impairment of the senses and obstruction of the channels. In a condition of anger or fright, the enema will mount very high. In a condition of intoxication or fainting due to derangement of consciousness, there will be complications of injury to the mind. In persons who are suffering from incessant vomiting, ptyalism, dyspnea, cough and hiccup, the Vata turned into an upward course, will carry the enema fluid upwards. In persons afflicted with obstruction or perforation of intestines, ascites, or meteorism, the enemata, still increasing the distension, may kill the patient. In conditions of intestinal torpor, acute intestinal irritation, abortion and diarrhea, there will occur disorders of chyme. And in cases of diabetes and dermatosis, there will be further aggravation of the disease. Hence, in these conditions, corrective enema should not be given.
16. Corrective enema is indicated in all other conditions and especially in general and local diseases in gastric disorders, retention of flatus, feces, urine and semen, and in loss or morbidity of vitality, color, flesh and semen, in meteorism, numbness of the limbs, helminthiasis, disorders of misperistalsis, simple diarrhea,joint-pain, sense of extreme heat, splenic disorders, Gulma, colic, cardiac disorders, fistula-in-ano, insanity, fever, inguinal swelling, headache, earache, cardiac spasm, rigidity of side of the chest, back and waist, tremor, convulsions, heaviness, extreme lightness, amenorrhea, irregular condition of gastric fire, aches, atrophy or rigidity of buttocks, knees, calf, thigh, ankles, heels, feet, gynecic organs, arms, fingers, nipples of the breast, teeth, nails, bones and joints, intestinal gurgling, griping pain and frequent passage of foul smelling and scanty stools along with flatus, and especially in the disorders of Vata enumerated in the chapter on nomenclature of diseases. In these conditions corrective enema is considered the foremost of medications and it acts like the cutting at the root of a tree.
17. Unctuous enema is contraindicated in all those conditions in which corrective enema is contraindicated and especially in persons who have not taken any food, in recent fevers, anemia, jaundice, urinary disorders, piles, coryza, anorexia, weakness of gastric fire, debility, splenic disorders, abdominal diseases, of the Kapha type, spastic paraplegia, looseness of stools, ingestion of natural or chemical poisons, discharge of mucus or bile, hard-bowelled condition, elephantiasis, deradenoncus, scrofula and intestinal worms.
18. Now, in persons who have not taken any food, unctuous solution spreads far upwards owing to there being no obstruction in the alimentary tract. In conditions of recent fever, anemia, jaundice and urinary anomalies, it will provoke the humors and cause abdominal diseases. In piles it will make the piles slimy and cause distension of abdomen; in anorexia, it will further impair the desire for food; in weakness of gastric fire, it will make it still weaker; in coryza, splenic disorders and similar other conditions and in a condition of provoked humors it will further aggravate the condition. Therefore, in these conditions one should not give unctuous enemata.
19. The unctuous enema is indicated in those very conditions where corrective enema is indicated and specially in persons who are low in unctuous quality and are afflicted with an acute gastric fire and disorders purely of morbid Vata. In these conditions, the unctuous enema is considered the foremost of medications and is like water to a tree poured at its very roots.
20. The conditions where the errhine therapy is contra-indicated are indigestion, persons who have just taken their meals or an unctuous potion, those that are thirsty, those that have bathed their head, those just going to take their bath, those that are afflicted with hunger, thirst or fatigue or are intoxicated, fainted, or injured with a weapon or a stick, or are exhausted by sex-act, exertion or drink, those who have recently suffered fever or are afflicted with grief, those who have just been purged or are given an unctuous enema, the gravida, and those that are just afflicted with coryza; nor should the errhine therapy be given in the wrong season or on a cloudy day.
21. Of these conditions, in a person with indigestion or in one who has taken his meals, the errhine treatment will occlude the channels going to the upper part of the body and will cause cough, dyspnea, vomiting and coryza. If it is administered to persons who have taken the unctuous potion or persons who are thirsty for wine or water, and if these persons drink it immediately after the errhine-treatment, it will cause excessive discharge from the mouth and the nose, increase of secretion from the eye (cataract) and diseases of the head. In persons who have taken a head bath or in those who take a head bath after the errhination, it will cause coryza. In persons afflicted with hunger it will provoke the Vata; and in those afflicted with thirst it will intensify the thirst and cause parching of the mouth. In persons who are afflicted with fatigue, intoxication and fainting, it will cause the same ill effects as mentioned with reference to corrective enema; in persons injured with a weapon or a Stick, it will make the pain more acute; in persons exhausted by over-work, sex-act or drink, there will be affliction of the head, shoulder-region, eye and chest. In persons who have recently suffered from fever or who are afflicted with grief, the heat, spreading in the vessels in the eyes, will cause cataract and rise of body-temperature; in persons just purged, the Vata, getting provoked, will injure the sense organs. In persons who have just taken the unctuous enema, it will cause heaviness of the head, pruritus and helmenthiasis. In pregnant women, it will stiffen the fetus and the fetus may become one-eyed, or afflicted with deformation of the hand, hemiplegia, or paraplegia; in persons afflicted recently with coryza, it will cause complications in the bodychannels. If administered in the wrong season or on a cloudy day, it will produce disorders of cold, stink-nose or diseases of the head; therefore the errhine treatment is not indicated in these onditions.
22. The errhine is indicated in all other conditions and specially in stiffness of the head, teeth or sides of the neck, spasm of the throat and jaw, or coryza. Galashundika [galaśuṇḍikā], Shaluka [śālūka], Shukra [śukra], Timira, diseases of the eye-lid, moles, glossitis, hemicrania, diseases of neck, shoulder region, shoulders, mouth, nose, ear, eye, cranium, forehead, facial paralysis, convulsions, contractions, deradenoncus, tooth-ache, setting of teeth on edge, looseness of teeth, injection of eyes, malignant tumor, alteration of voice, loss of speech, spasmodic speech etc., and diseases affecting the upper part of the supra-clavicular region of the body, as a result of the morbid Vata and other humors which get fully developed. In these conditions, errhine treatment is considered the foremost of medications. Entering every interspace of the head, this withdraws the whole of the morbid matter, just as a wick acts in an oil lamp.
23. If errhine treatment is to be given in urgent conditions, in seasons other than the first rains, autumn or spring, then it should be given by making artificial conditions of these seasons. It should be given in the morning in summer, in the noon in the winter and in the rainy season when there are no clouds in the sky.
Summary
Here are the recapitulatory verses—24. Thus has the fivefold mode of purificatory therapy been propounded regarding what is contra-indicated, in whom and wherefore and similarly what is indicated and in whom.
25. But the intelligent physician should not determine this according to the letter of these directions exclusively, but must use his own discretion and reasoning in arriving at decisions-
26. There may arise situations in view of the nature of the place, time and the vitality of a particular patient, when, what is contra-indicated in a patient, may be necessary for him aud what is indicated may have to be avoided.
27. Emesis in vomiting, cardiac disease and Gulma, and enemata in dermatosis- though contra-indicated, are generally recommended at particular stages of the disease, in the chapters dealing with therapeutics.
28. Hence, despite the directions laid down, therapeutic measures should be decided upon by the physician, with the use of his own discretion. The success achieved without the exercise of reason is indeed success resulting from chance.
2. Thus, in the Section on Success in Treatment, in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the second chapter entitled ‘The Success in Treatment through the Quinary Procedures—Fivefold Purificatory Therapy [pañcakarma—panchakarma-siddhi]’ not being available, the same as restored by Dridhabala, is completed.
The Material and Size etc., of Enema Tube
7. The enema tube should be made of gold, silver, tin, copper, brass, bronze, bone, wood, bamboo, ivory, reed, horn or crystal and fitted with well-made ears.
8-9½. The length of the enema tube should be six, twelve or eight finger-breadths, according as the age of the patient is six, twenty or twelve years respectively. The hole or calibre of the tube should be such that it allows the passage of a green gram, jujube or math grain respectively, and stopped with a stylet, and the circumference of the tube at the base and apex should be respectively of the thumb and the little finger of the patient. It should be straight and tapering like the cow's tail, smooth and globular at the mouth. There should be one ear attached to it at the first quarter from the mouth and there should be two ears more at the base for linking it with the receptaele.
10-11; The enema receptacle should be made of the bladder of an old ox, buffallo, deer, hog or goat. It should be firm, thin, with all its veins removed, free from smell, tanned and colored red with astringents and very soft and very clean. On ascertaining the age of the patient, the bladder should be connected with the appropriate kind of enema-tube, and well secured by means of strings.
11½. If the bladder is not available, the throat of a pelican or the skin of a bat or a very thick cloth may be used instead.
Method, Complications, diet etc.
12-12½. The expert physician, knowing a patient to be fit for the administration of corrective enema should start treatment after the patient has fully digested his food and is composed in mind, on an auspicious day in the bright fortnight under a propitious constellation and in. a good Muhurta and Yoga,
13-19½. Take four tolas each of heart-leaved sida, guduch, the three myrobalans, Indian groundsel and decaradices, eight fruits of emetic nut and twenty tolas of goat’s flesh. Decoct them in water till reduced to 1/4 the quantity; then filter and add to it the paste prepared of one tola each of celery seeds, emetic nut, bael, costus, sweet flag, dill seeds, nut grass and long pepper, and mix 4 tolas of gur and 16 tolas of ghee and oil, slightly warmed and a proportionate quantity of honey and rocksalt. Emulsify this with a pestle and put it in the enema receptacle. The enema apparatus should be well fixed, all the air should be expelled and the curves and wrinkles should. be smoothed out. Having removed the stylet from the mouth of the tube, one should cover it with the middle of the thumb. The patient should first be well prepared with inunction of the body. He should have passed feces and urine, and should not be very hungry; he should be placed on a flat bed or bed with a slightly lowered head. The bed should not be very high, it should be well spread and prepared. The patient should lie comfortably on his left side. He should keep his body straight and pillowing himself on his inter-locked hands, he should flex his right leg over his body and fully extend his left leg. Lubricating his anus, the physician should introduce one fourth of the enema tube which has been smeared with oil, slowly and rightly following the curve of the spinal column. He.should not shake nor tremble and should bring to bear all the dexterity of his hand in performing his act. He should, with a single act of compression on the receptacle, inject the contents; and then he should gradually withdraw the nozzle of. the tube from the anus.
20-22½. If the enema tube is inserted obliquely, the fluid will not flow, and if the nozzle is jerked about, wounds are likely to be caused in the rectum. If it is given slowly, it may not reach to its destination; and if given with great force, it may run up very high in the alimentary canal, even upto the throat. If the enema solution is too cold, it will cause stiffness; if it is very hot, it will cause local irritation and fainting. If it is unctuous it will lead to dullness; and if it is very dry, it will provoke Vata; and if it is very thin or in small dose or not mixed with salt, it will be abortive in action. If it is excessive in dose, it will produce the effects of over-action and weakness; if it is very viscid, it will take a long time to return. If salt is added in excess, it will cause burning and diarrhea. Therefore, the enemaenema [basti] should be properly prepared and given in the right manner.
23-23½. The pharmacist should first take unctuous substance, honey and rocksalt and emulsify it and then add the paste and continue to rub. Then he should add the fluid decoction, and fully mixing them up with a pestle, place it in the enema-receptacle.
24-24½. As the organ of assimilation and the rectum are situated on the left side of the body, the enema will be taken well by the person who is lying on his left side; and as the folds and valves of the rectum get straightened out, it is said that the enema should be administered to the patient while he is lying on his left side.
25-25½. If in the middle of the enema administration the patient gets an urge to pass feces or flatus, the enema tube should be drawn out and when the urge has passed away, the remaining solution, should be injected; he should lie supine on the bed with his body in a raised position by means of a pillow in such a way that the effect of the enema pervades the whole body.
26. The first enema expels the Vata from its natural course, the second will expel the Pitta, and the third will expel the Kapha.
27. When the solution has returned, the person should be affused with genially warm water, and should be given a diet of Shali rice along with thin meat juice; when this is digested, the physician should give him light diet in a smallquantity in the evening and then should give him an unctuous enema for the sake of strengthening him.
28-29½. After giving him the unctuous enema, which is ¼ (1/4th) the quantity of the evacuative enema aud which is prepared with oil, acid articles and drugs curative of Vata, the physician should press the buttocks together with the palms of the hands in order to prevent the early return of the oil. While the patient is lying supine in the bed, his joints of the feet and the toes should be pulled and cracked gently and the soles of his feet should be slightly rubbed with unctuous substances, and the heels, toes and the calves and all other parts which are afflicted with pain should also be massaged. The patient may then lie at ease and sleep with his head resting on a pillow.
30-30½. In an evacuative enema consisting of 96 tolas of solution, there should be 40 tolas of decotion. The unctuous portion should consist of one sixth of the whole solution if the enema is given in a condition of morbid Pitta or of normal health. It should be ¼ (1/4th) in conditions of morbid Vata and 1/8 in conditions of morbid Kapha.
31-32½. The dose of the evacuative enema should be of 4 tolas for a patient aged one year and the dose should be increased by four tolas for every year till the twelfth year. After the twelfth year, the increase for each succeeding year should be 8 tolas till the eighteenth year, until the maximum dose of 98 tolas is reached. This is the dose prescribed upto the age of 70. After that, the dose should be that prescribed for a patient of 16 years (80 tolas). Thus has been, described the dosage in term of Prasrita [prasṛta] which is equal to eight tolas. In children and in the aged, the enema should be prepared with mild medicines.
33-33½. The bed which is neither too high nor too low, which has a foot-rest and which is spread with a soft quilt, is good. The patient should lie with his head towards the east and cover himself with a white sheet.
34-34½. His diet should be determined with due regard to his disease and should consist of soups, milk, and meat-juices, to suit conditions of Kapha, Pitta and Vata respectively. This is the principle to be observed in the administration of evacuative enema. Hereafter, I shall describe the enema preparations.
35-35½. The decoction of the two varieties of penta-radices mixed with sour conjee and juice of the goat’s flesh along with the paste of drugs of the heart-leaved sida group and the triad of unctuous substances, is an excellent preparation for the evacuative enema. It is regarded as curative of all diseases due to Vata.
36-37½. Take 64 tolas of the decoction of the drugs of the ticktrefoil group along with heart-leaved sida, wild snake gourd, zalil, castor and barley and mix with half the quantity of the meat-juice of the goat and reduce it by cooking it to 64 tolas. Add to it the paste of perfumed cherry, long pepper, nut grass, oil, ghee, honey and rocksalt and prepare the enema. This enema is stimulative of the gastric fire, promotive of flesh and strength, and of the strength of the eyesight.
38-42. Take 12 tolas of the roots of castor and four tolas of each of palas, the small variety of penta-radices, Indian groundsel, winter cherry, common mallow, guduch, hog’s weed, purging cassia and deodar along with eight fruits of emetic nut; this should be boiled in 512 tolas of water and reduced to ⅛ (1/8th) the quantity adding the paste of one tola each of dill seeds, juniper, perfumed cherry, long pepper, liquorice, heart-leaved sida, extract of Indian berberry, kurchi seeds and nut grass along with rock salt, honey, oil and cow’s urine, and should be administered as enema [basti]. It is stimulative of gastric fire and revulsive. It is curative of aches in the leg, thighs, feet, sacrum and back, and of the obstruction of Vata by Kapha and stasis of Vata. This enema of castor root etc., when duly administered, alleviates the stasis of feces, urine and flatus attended with colic, tympanitis, calculus, sand in the urine, constipation, piles and assimilation disorders.
43. 200 tolas of the meat-juice of the goat seasoned with 16 tolas of the mixture of oil and ghee soured with curds and pomegranate and mixed with the paste of heart-leaved sida and other drugs of its group and given as enema, is promotive of vitality, flesh, color, semen and gastric fire, and is recommended in blindness and pain in the head.
44-45. Take 32 tolas of Palas and decoct in 512 tolas of water till reduced to 28 tolas and mix with the paste of four tolas each of sweet flag and long pepper and eight tolas of dill seeds, adding rock salt, honey and oil.

46. The evacuative enema of milk prepared with 32 tolas of liquorice, dill seeds, emetic nut and long pepper and mixed with ghee and honey is beneficial in rheumatic condition, change of voice and acute spreading affections.
47. The milk boiled with liquorice, lodh, chebulic myrobalan, sandal lotus and blue lotus and mixed with sugar and honey, and then cooled and mixed with the paste of the life-promoter group of drugs, makes an excellent enema for the cure of all disorders due to Pitta.
48-52. Take two to as each of sandal, sacred lotus, Ridhi, liquorice, Indian groundsel, Vasaka, black Indian sarsaparilla, lodh, Indian madder, white sarsaparilla, heart-leaved sida, a d the penta-radices of the ticktrefoil group as well as the penta-radices of the grass group and decoct in water; 128 tolas of milk should be mixed with this decoction and boiled till all the water is evaporated; then add the paste of Jivanti, Meda, Ridhi, climbing, asparagus, Vira, the two varieties of Kakoli, luffa, sugar-candy, Jivaka, lotus filament, white lotus, blue waterlily, lodh, cowage, liquorice, white yam, salep, fragrant poon and sandal, along with ghee, honey and rock salt. This enema should be given cold. After the enema fluid has returned, the patient should take an affusion-bath and then eat a meal of cooked rice mixed with the meat-juice of Jangala creatures or with milk. This is curative of burning, diarrhea, leucorrhea, hemothermia, cardiac disorder, anemia, irregular fever, Gulma, suppression of urine, jaundice and all diseases due to Pitta.
53-55. Take the milk prepared with the decoction of one tola each of the grape group of drugs, white teak, mahwa, fragrant sticky mallow, Indian sarsaparilla, sandal and jequirity and mixed with the paste of east Indian globe thistle, wild bean, liquorice and wheat flour, and with honey ghee, liquorice and oil, and the juice of chebulic myrobalan, white yam, sugarcane and gur; this administered as enema, is regarded as curative of Pitta. This is recommended to patients suffering from burning in the epigastric, umbilical and hypochondriac regions and head, or in burning in the internal organs, in dysuria and in conditions of cachexia, pectoral lesions, loss of semen and diarrhea of the Pitta type.
56-57½. Take 80 tolas of decoction prepared by boiling in water mountain ebony, purging cassia, deodar, black nightshade, trilobed virgin’s bower, kurchi, mudar, Patha, horse-gram and Indian nightshade. Add to these, the paste of one tola each of rape-seed, cardamom, emetic nut and costus, and 8 tolas of each of the oil known as the emetic nut oil, honey, barley-alkali and rape-seed oil. This should be administered by the wise physician as evacuative enema to patients afflicted with disorders of Kapha, weakness of the gastric fire and disgust for food.
58-60. Or administer as enema the decoction prepared in water of wild snake-gourd, chebulic myrobalan, deodar and long pepper, or the decoction of the two varieties of pentaradices, the three myrobalans, bael and emetic nuts and cow’s urine. Add to this the paste of kurchi, Patha, emetic nut and nut grass, rocksalt and oil along with barley alkali. The evacuative enema with this solution is foremost in curing diseases of the Kapha type of anemia, intestinal stasis and chyme disorders. It also cures stasis of flatus and urine and severe distension of the bladder.
61-64. The evacuative enema should be prepared from the decoction of Indian groundsel, guduch, castor, embelia, Indian berberry, dita bark, cuscus grass, deodar, neem, purging cassia, chiretta, wild snake-gourd, Patha, kurroa, kidney-leaved ipomea, decaradices, nut grass, zalil, drumstick, the three myrobalans and mixed with the decoction of emetic nut and cow’s urine along with the paste of liquorice, long pepper, bottle gourd, dillseeds, extract of Indian berberry, white sweet flag, embelia, kurchi seeds, Patha and nut grass, adding rock salt, ghee, honey, and oil. This enema is administered in helminthiasis, dermatosis, urinary disorders, inguinal swelling, abdominal disease, indigestion and in diseases due to Kapha. In patients suffering from the above diseases, even if they are in a condition of depletion as a result of un-unctuous medications, this enema removes the morbidity of Vata, promotes the gastric fire, subdues the diseases and increases the patient’s vitality.
65-68. Take four tolas each of hog’s weed, castor, vasaka, Indian rock foil, white hog weed, bishop’s weed, heart-leaved sida, Palas, the two varieties of penta-radices, eight fruits of the emetic nut well crushed and washed, and eight tolas each of the bael, barley and the fruits of jujube, horse-gram and coriander, and 512 tolas of milk and water; then add ghee.

It should be mixed with the paste of sweet flag, dill seeds, deodar, costus, liquorice, rape seed, long pepper, bishop’s weed and emetic nut and with gur, rock salt and 24 tolas of honey, oil and ghee mixed together. This, in a lukewarm condition, should be administered as evacuative enema in due manner by the expert. It is curative of all diseases born of continued discordances of the humors.
69. One evacuative enema which is unctuous and warm and mixed with meat-juice is to be given in conditions of Vata. Two evacuative enemas which are sweet and cold and mixed with milk are to be given in conditions of Pitta and three evacuative enemas that are pungent, hot and acute and mixed with cow’s urine are to be given in conditions of Kapha. Not more than these specified evacuative enemas are to be given.
70. In conditions of Vata, the next meal should be taken mixed with meatjuice; in Pitta, it should be taken mixed with milk, and in Kapha, it should be taken mixed with soups. Similarly, in conditions demanding unctuous enemata, the bael oil, the oil prepared with life-promoter group of drugs and oil prepared with the emetic nut are to be given respectively, in conditions of Vata, Pitta and Kapha.
Summary
71. Thus, the best method of administering the enema-treatment has been fully and properly expounded here. The wise man who learning this, administers the euema treatment, achieves complete success in his treatment.
3. Thus, in the Section on Success in Treatment, in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the third chapter entitled ‘Success in Treatment through the Principles of the Enema Procedure [basti-sutra-sddhi]’ not being available, the same as restored by Dridhabala, is completed.
Recipes, Symptoms and Treatment
47. Take four tolas each of decaradices, heart-leaved sida, Indian groundsel, winter cherry, hog’s weed, guduch, castor, bishop’s weed, beetle killer, vasaka, ginger grass, climbing asparagus, crested purple nail dye, small stinking swallow wort and eight tolas each of barley, black gram, linseed, jujube, and horsegram, and decoct in 4096 tolas of water till reduced to 1024 tolas; this should be mixed and cooked with 256 tolas of oil and an equal quantity of milk along with the paste of 4 tolas of each of life-promoter group of drugs. This preparation of oil, used as unctuous enema, cures all disorders of Vata. Similarly the fat of wet-land creatures prepared with the paste of lifepromoter group of drugs may be used.
8. The oil, prepared with dill seeds, barley, bael and sour articles, is beneficial in Vata, and the ghee heated by the warmth of roasted rocksalt is also curative of Vata.
9-11. The dyad of oil-cum-ghee may be prepared by cooking it with four times the quantity of milk along with the paste of cork swallow wort, emetic nut, Meda, east Indian globe thistle, liquorice, heart-leaved sida, dill seeds, Rishabhaka, long pepper, stinking swallow wort, climbing asparagus, Swagupta, Kshirakakoli, cucumber, zedoary and sweet flag. This is roborant, curative of Vata-cum-Pitta, and is curative of urinary, seminal and menstrual disorders.
12. The dyad of ghee and oil, containing til oil of one fourth quantity should be prepared in four times the quantity of milk with the paste of the drugs of the sandal group in whatever quantity available. This preparation, given as an unctuous enema is curative of Pitta.
13-16. Make into paste rock salt, emetic nut, costus, dill seeds, hijjal tree, sweet flag, fragrant sticky mallow, liquorice, beetle killer, deodar, box myrtle, ginger, orris root, Meda, long pepper, white flowered leadwort, zedoary, embelia, Indian atees, black turpeth, pea, indigo, ticktrefoil, bael, celery, long pepper, red physic nut and Indian groundsel. Either castor oil or til oil prepared with this paste, is curative of disorders of Kapha. Given as unctuous enema, it cures inguinal swelling, misperistalsis, Gulma, piles, splenic disorders, rheumatic conditions, constipation and calculus.
17. The physician should prepare an oil curative of Kapha by cooking it with the paste of emetic nut and sour articles or with the paste of the bael group of drugs or with the paste of the drugs curative of Kapha.
18-22. An oil may be prepared in the decoction of embelia, castor, turmeric, wild snake gourd, the three myrobalans, guduch, sprouts of Spanish jasmine, chaste tree, deca-radices, ipomea, neem, Patha, crested purple nail dye, purging cassia aud Indian oleander along with the paste of emetic nut, bael, turpeth, long pepper, Indian groundsel, chiretta, deodar, dita bark, sweet flag, cuscus grass, Indian berberry, costus, kurchi seeds, Indian madder, turmeric, dill seeds, white flowered leadwort, zedoary, angelica and orris root. This, adininistered as potion, inunction and unctuous enema, is a speedy cure for dermatosis, helminthiasis, urinary disorders, piles, assimilation disorders, impotency, irregular condition of the gastric fire, excess of morbid matter, as well as the morbidity of the three humors.
23-24. This unctuous enema [sneha-basti] is an excellent promoter of strength in those whose strength and vitality have sunk low, as a result of disease, over-exertion, over-work, exercise and loadcarrying, and in those of diminished semen. It imparts great firmness to the feet, legs, thighs, back, shoulders and waist, and imparts fertility to sterile women and men.
25. There are six conditions of complication likely to arise in the administration of the unctuous enemata [sneha-basti]; the unctuous fluid may be obstructed by Vata, Pitta or Kapha or by excess of food or fecal matter, and sixthly when given to a person on an empty stomach.
26-26¾. If the enema fluid is given in a cold condition or in meagre quantity, in a condition of excess of Vata, if it is given in a hot condition in Pitta, or a mild enema is given in Kapha or if the enema prepared with heavy articles is given after a heavy meal, or a weak i.e., forceless enema is given in accumulation of feces, the enema fluid thus given will not be able to reach its destination as its course is obstructed by these conditions; while in a patient with an empty stomach it reaches upwards owing to the absence of any such obstruction.
27-28. These are then the symptoms produced—body-aches, fever, distension of abdomen, chill, stifness, pain in the thighs, and pain and cramps in the sides. The physician should know from these symptoms that the unctuous fluid is occluded by Vata.
29-30. The physician should eliminate it well by evacuative enema of unctuous, acid, salt and hot substances mixed with the oil of Indian groundsel and Indian berberry, prepared with Sauviraka and Sura wines, jujube, horsegram and barley, cow’s urine and the decoction of penta-radices. After the evening meals, the physician should administer unctuous enema of the above-said oils.
31. The physician should know the enema to be occluded by Pitta, if there occur burning, redness, thirst, stupor, faintness and fever. These conditions should be cured with the enema prepared with sweet and bitter groups of drugs
32. The physician should know it to be occluded by Kapha if there occur torpor, algid fever, lethargy, ptyalism, anorexia, heaviness, fainting and epression.
33. This should be treated with enema prepared with astringent, pungent, acute and hot substances, and with Sura wine and cow’s urine, and mixed with the emetic nut oil and sour articles.
34. The physician should know it to be occluded by excess of intake of food, if there occur vomiting, fainting, anorexia, depression, colic, somnolence, body-aches, symptoms of chyme disorders and burning.
35. The treatment in such conditions is to stimulate digestion by means of decoctions and powders of pungent aud salt drugs, and mild purgation, and the line of treatment indicated in chyme-disorders is also beneficial.
36-37. Knowing that the unctuous fluid is occluded by fecal matter by observing retention of feces, urine and flatus, pain, heaviness and distension of abdomen and cardiac spasm, the physician should treat the patient with oleation and sudation procedures, suppositories and evacuative enema prepared with black turpeth, bael and other drugs of that group, with unctuous enema [sneha-basti] and with the line of treatment indicated in misperistalsis.
38. In an enema given to a person on an empty stomach or emptied bowels, if the unctuous fluid is given with great force, it goes up very high and from there may reach the throat and may came out from the upper orifices of the body.
39. In these conditions, the evacuative and unctuous enemata of oil prepared with cows urine, black turpeth, barley, jujube and horse gram should be given.
40.and the conditions where it is coming out of the throat, it should be remedied by astringent medications, pressure on the throat and by purgatives and anti-emetic remedies.
41.In conditions where though the unctuous fluid has not returned or returned only partially owing to obstruction but has not caused any complication owing to the unctuous condition of the body, the patient should be let alone by the experienced physician
42. The person, who has taken the unctuous enema, should be given warm water to drink, and light or wholesome diet; the p tient after taking the diet in right proportion should take unctuous enema every third day.
43.In the next morning the wise physician should administer the patient who has well spent the night, the potion of water prepared with coriander and ginger or simple warm water.
44-45. This warm water digests the unctuous substance which has remained undigested, breaks, down the mucus and regulates the peristaltic movement of Vata in the patient. Therefore, after emesis or purgation or administration of evacuative or unctuous enemata, warm water should be given for the alleviation of Vata and Kapha.
46. The persons who are habituated to dry things, whose digestive fire is very active, who are habituated to physical exertion, who are suffering from Vata disorders, who are afflicted with disorders of Vata in the groin or pelvic region or disorders of misperistalsis, should be given unctuous enema every day.
47. In such perons, the unctuous substance is immediately digested, just as water falling over sand is quickly absorbed; and in persons other than these, the gastric fire generally takes three days to digest the unctuous substance
48, The unctuous substance should never be given unboiled as it would cause increase of mucus secretion in the rectum, and some portion should be allowed to remain in the enema vessel, because, along with the last parts, air would enter into the rectum.
49. Oleation should never be done simultaneously by the mouth as well as by the rectum. The oleation taken by both the channels meeting together will vitiate Vata and the gastric fire.
50-51. One should not develop excessively the habit of either the unctuous or the evacuative enema. By habituation to the unctuous enema [sneha-basti] there will be rousing of the Kapha and Pitta and impairment of the gastric fire, and by habituation to the evacuative enema, there is the risk of the provocation of Vata. Therefore the person who has taken evacuative enema should be given unctuous enema and the person who has been given unctuous enema should be given evacuative enema. By this procedure of alternating the unctuous with the evacuative enema, the enema therapy becomes curative of the morbidity of all three humors.
Matra enema
52. The ‘Matra’ [mātrā] enema is recommended for daily use in persons emaciated by over-work, over-exertion, load lifting, way-faring, riding or indulgence in women, in debilitated persons as well as in those afflicted with Vata disorders.
53 54. The Matra enema does not demand any regimen of diet or behaviour. It can be administered at all times and in all seasons and is harmless Its dose is equivalent to the minimum dose of oleation. Matra enema is promotive of strength, demands no strict regimen of diet, causes easy elimination of feces and urine, and is roborant and curative of Vata disorders.
Summary
Here are the two recapitulatory verses—
55. The foremost of unctuous enemata [sneha-basti] beneficial in the alleviation of Vata and other humors are described herein, as well as the complications arising from their use by ignorant persons, along with the treatment of those complications. What should be taken before taking the unctuous enema, who are those in whom administration of the enema is indicated every day or every third day, the method of administering the unctuous enema and also that of Matra enema, are all described in this chapter.
4. Thus, in the Section on Success in Treatment, in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the fourth chapter entitled ‘The Success in Treatment of the Complications arising from the Unctuous Enema [sneha-vyapad-siddhi]’, not being available, the same as restored by Dridhabala, is completed.
Avoidable tubes and their evils
3. Now listen to the description of the enema tube [netra-basti] and the enema receptacle that are to be avoided in this procedure and to the exposition of the complications which arise from such apparatus as well as from the administration of enema by an inexperienced person, as also the treatment of these complications,
4-5. The physician should avoid eight kinds of enema tubes viz., those that are too short, too long, too thin, too thick, worn out or loosely fixed, which have holes on the sides or are tortuous Not reaching the destination, penetrating too far up, shaking in the rectum, injury to the rectum, fluid leaking out, pain in the rectum, oblique flow of the fluid—these are, respectively the harmful effects of the above described defective conditions of the enema tube.
Evils of wrongful enemas and their administration
6-7. The physician should avoid eight kinds of enema receptacles in this procedure viz., those that are irregular, fleshy, torn, thick, which have many perforations, which are bubbled inside, sticky and worn out. Irregular flow, fleshy odor, leakage of fluid, difficulty to grasp, absence of flow, frothiness of fluid slipping away from the hand and difficulty of holding are respectively the results of the above mentioned defective conditions of the receptacle.
8 The following are the defects resulting from the defective technique of the enema administrator. The air may be pushed into the rectum, enema may be given too hurriedly, the tube may be pushed too high, or it may be introduced obliquely; he may do repeated compression or he may shake the tube while introducing or he may do frequent insertion of the tube or he may not be able to insert it in the rectum, or he may compress the receptacle either too slowly or too forcibly.
9-9½. If the enema hag has been fixed without the air in it being pushed out, or if all the enema fluid has been pushed in without leaving any residue, the air entering the rectum and provoking the Vata there, causes colicky and piercing pain. In such a condition, inunction and sudation of the anus, and food and drink curative of Vata are indicated.
Treatment
10-11. If the enema tube has been introduced too hurriedly or if it is pushed very high, there will occur pain in the waist, rectum and legs, rigidity of the bladder and pain in the thighs. In such a condition, inunction, sudation procedures, enemata and diet that are curative of Vata, are indicated.
12. If the enema tube is introduced obliquely or is obstructed by the anal folds or is blocked by substances in the enema fluid itself, the enema fluid will not flow. The enema tube then should be taken out, cleansed and properly re-introduced.
13-13½. If there are interruptions in the act of compression resulting in repeated compression, the Vata in the rectum being thus struck repeatedly, becomes highly provoked and causes pain in the chest, head and thighs, and also asthenia. In such a condition, is indicated the enema prepared from the bael group of drugs, emetic nut aud the black turpeth group of drugs mixed with cow’s urine.
14-4½. If the rectum is injured by the shaking of the tube, there will be burning, sense of heat and edema. In such conditions, astringent, sweet and cold affusions and enemata are indicated.
1546. If the anal valves are hurt by excessive penetration of the enema tube, there will be pain, burning, rectalgia and the discharge of fecal matter. In such a condition the use of ghee, sweet milk and mucilageuous enema are recommended.
17. The inadequately compressed enema does not reach the destination and returns too soon In such conditions, unctuous enema should be properly administered again, by one desiring success in treatment.
18. If over-forcibly administered, the enema is retained in the stomach or goes up and Teaches the throat. In such conditions, enema, purgation and pressure on the neck etc., are the requisite measures of treatment.
Summary
Here is the recapitulatory verse.
19. The wise physician who has a knowledge of these complications with regard to the enema tube [netra-basti], receptacle as well as the ineptness of the enema administrator and the treatment of these complications, should be engaged to give the treatment.
5. Thus, in the Section on Success in Treatment, in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka,the fifth chapter entitled ‘The Success in Treatment of the Complications arising from the Defects in the Enema Apparatus or in the Technique of Administration of the Enema [netra-basti-vyapad-siddhi]’, not being available, the same as restored by Dridhabala, is completed.
Time and Method of Purgation [virecana]
4. Summer, the rainy season and winter are hot, rainy and cold respectively. In between them, there are three seasons called the early rains and two others which have mild seasonal characteristics.
5-6. Pravrit [prāvṛt] the (early rains) is comprised of Ashadha and Shravana, and Sharad (autumn) is Kartika and Margashirsha,and Vasanta (spring) is Phalguna and Caitra. These are the seasons in which seasonal purification is to be done. The physician should classify seasons in this way and give seasonal purification in condition of normal health; but in cases of disease, he should administer purification whensoever found necessary in view of the disease-condition.
7. In the intervals between the procedures of emesis [vamana] and purgation [virecana] etc,, the physician should give oleation and sudation procedures, and in the end, he should give sedative oleation,
8. The physician should not give an excessive dose of preparatory oleation before purgation to those who are suffering from acute spreading affections, pimples, edema, jaundice, anemia, trauma and toxicosis.
9. The persons who have excessive unctuous quality in the body should not be given unctuous purgatives. The persons, in whose body the unctuous element has become agitated, should be given non-unctuous purgatives.
10. When a person has been well prepared with oleation and sudation procedures, and after his previous meal has been fully digested, if the ingests the right dose of medication, with bis mind concentrated on the treatment, it brings about the most desirable results.
11. As in a vessel smeared with oil, water slips down without any effort, similarly Kapha and other morbid humors slip out easily in a body which has undergone oleation therapy.
12. As fire makes the water in moist wood to trickle out from every pore, similarly sudation causes the fixed toxic matter to melt and flow out in a person who has been previously oleated.
13. Just as dirt in a dirty cloth is separated and washed out by water, so, by oleation and sudation, the toxic matter in the body is segregated and washed out by purgation [virecana].
14. If the purificatory dose is taken when the previous meal is undigested, there will occur depression and constipation, and the medication acts in a wrong way.
15-16. That should be known as the proper medication which requires to be taken in small dose, which is quick in action and is curative of even an excessive degree of morbidity, which is easy to take, which is light in digestion, palatable, pleasing, curative of the particular disease, not harmful even if complications arise, not very depressant and is possessed of the most agreeable smell, color and taste.
17. If a person after cleansing his mind of its impurities like passion and other inauspicious sentiments and concentrating his mind on the treatment takes this dose, it brings about the most desirable results.
18-18½. The person, who is going to have emesis [vamana] the next day, should take diet which is easily digestible, mostly liquid and promotive of mucus secretion; and the person who is going to take purgation [virecana], should eat light and warm articles of diet. Owing to increase of mucus in the former case and diminution of mucus in the latter, the morbid humors quickly flow out.
Signs of successful purification
19-20. In a person who has taken the purificatory dose, the physician should keep observing the development of the signs of complete purification. In the case of emesis, when bile appears after the mucus in the vomitus, and in the case of purgation mucus appears after feces and bile, and there occur weakness, debility and lightness of the body, it should be considered the stage of complete elimination of morbid matter.
21-21½. After this stage if any part of the dose is left in the body, it should be eliminated by emesis. But if lightness has not developed in the body, it should not be done. In case there are stiffness and accumulation of Vata, the patient should be made to vomit even if there occur no eructations. Emesis should be done till there occur lightness of the body and thinning of the mucus. If carried further, it will be attended with great disaster.
22-23. Emesis [vamana] promotes the gastric fire and the humors get sedated. The person who has vomited should be starved as long as the signs of the full digestion of the medication are not seen; and on seeing these signs, the dietetic regimen of gruels should be carried out and the starvation should be stopped.
24. The gastric fire in the body of the person who has been cleansed by the purificatory procedures and freed from all morbid matter, becomes weakened. Therefore, a course of dietetic regimen of thin gruels etc., should be carried out.
25. The physician should prescribe the dietetic regimen of demulcent drinks etc., in conditions where Kapha and Pitta are partially cleansed and in case of alcoholics or persons with Vata-cum-Pitta habitus; the thin gruels will have a liquefacient effect on their body.
26. Regular peristaltic movement of Vata, a sense of well-being, hunger, thirst, good spirits, self-confidence, lightness, clarity of the senses and of the eructations are the signs that indicate that the dose of medication has been completely digested.
27. Exhaustion, burning, asthenia, giddiness, fainting, headache, malaise and loss of vitality are the signs indicating that some part of medication is still left undigested
28. Medication taken at the wrong time or in under-dose or over-dose, or medication that is very old or which is not impregnated or not well prepared, will soon produce complications.
Ten complications
29-30. Distension of abdomen, griping pain, excessive discharge, cardiac spasm and spasm of the limbs, discharge of blood, improper action of the medication, rigidity, serious afflictions and exhaustion—these are considered to be the ten complications due to under-action or over-action of the drug or due to the defects of the attendant, the medication, the physician or the patient.
Symptoms of proper, under and over action of the procedures
31. Successful action is discharge in right proportion. If there is excessive discharge, it signifies over-action. Aud unsuccessful action is that where there is contrary action or there is no discharge or scanty discharge.
32. Purgative medication in a condition, where the Kapha is aroused, would act upwards, i.e., as in emetic if the medicine is bad in odor or unpalatable or is in a big dose and taken before the previous meal is digested.
33. The emetic dose which is taken in a condition when a person is afflicted with hunger, or where the person is of the soft-bowelled type or where Kapha in the stomach is poorly aroused or where medicine is strong or where the medicine taken becomes stagnant in the stomach and causes agitation, acts as a purgative.
34. These conditions where the actions of drugs are reversed and consequently elimination is partial, are known as conditions of unsuccessful action. It means that the morbid matter is either eliminated with difficulty, or not at all, or only slightly,
35a If after taking the dose, the body is not cleansed and the dose is fully digested, he may take a second dose. If the second dose is taken before the first is fully digested, there may be over-action.
36. In case of imperfect action of the dose, the physician should give a string or mild second dose, after ascertaining whether the person is of the hard-bowelled or the soft-bowelled type and also his vitality.
37.The physician should not give dose of emesis [vamana] to one who is bad subject for emesis or a second dose of purgation [virecana] should not be given to a hard-bowelled person. If they are so given, they will surely kill the patient.
Treatment of complications
38-39. The purificatory dose given to a person who is not prepared with preliminary oleation and sudation procedures, or to one who is dehydrated, or if the drug has become too old, it will only rouse the morbid matter and will be incapable of eliminating it; such a dose of medication causes many diseases: wrongful action, edema, hiccup, excessive faintness, cramps in the calf muscles, pruritus, asthenia of the thigh and discoloration
40-41. The purificatory medicine given in a very small dose to a person who has been prepared with oleation and sudation procedures, and whose digestive fire is strong and who, as a result, has digested away the medication or whose action has been impeded by ingestion of cold articles or by chyme, only rouses up the morbid matter but does not eliminate it. These conditions too would give rise to the same diseases. All these are conditions of imperfect or unsuccessful action. Knowing these as such, the wise physician should carry out the line of treatment in the manner laid down.
42. In such conditions, the person should be anointed with oil and salt, and sweated by means of bed sudation or mixed lump sudation method; and he should be given another purificatory dose after the first dose of medication is digested; or he may be given evacuative enema mixed with cow’s urine.
43. After the evacuative enema, he should be fed with meat-juice of Jangala animals and then should be given unctuous enema of oil prepared with emetic nut, long pepper and deodar, in proper dose.
44. After oleating him with unctuous articles curative of Vata he should be given again a strong purificatory dose. It should not be a very strong dose, as then, it will cause over-action.
45. The strong medications given to a person who is afflicted with hunger or who is soft-bowelled, would quickly eliminate not only the feces, bile and mucus, but also the fluid body-elements along with stools.
46. Thus, it would lead to the loss of vitality and voice, burning, dryness of throat, giddiness and thirst. In this condition, the physician should remove, the residual portion of the medication by giving him emesis prepared with drugs of the sweet group.
47- 48. In case of over-action of emesis, the physician should give purgation [virecana]; and in case of over-action of purgation the physician should give emesis. The over-flow should be stopped by treating the patient with cold affusions and immersion bath and with eats and drinks and drugs of astringent and sweet groups and of cooling quality. The patient may be treated with the medications curative of he hemothermia, diarrhea, burning an 1 fever.
49. The patient may drink the demulcent drink prepared of the extract of Indian berberry, sandalwood, cuscus, marrow and blood mixed with the powder of roasted paddy. This demulcent drink is an excellent curative of the effects of over-action.
50 The physician may give the thin gruel prepared of the sprouts of banyan or other milk-exuding trees mixed with honey, or milk or other articles of diet both prepared with medications that are intestinal astringents
51. He may be given the food, mixed with the meat juice of Jangala animals. The mucilagenous enema is also recommenced in this condition or he may be given an unctuous enema of ghee taken directly from milk and prepared with drugs of the sweet group.
52. In over-action of emesis [vamana], the person should be affused with cold water and then may be given a demulcent drink prepared of fruit juice mixed with ghee, honey and sugar.
5-3. In excessive vomiting with eructations, the patient may lick the powder of coriander, nut grass, mahwa and extract of berberry mixed with honey.
54. In a condition where the tongue has been extremely drawn in during vomiting, it is beneficial for the patient to take mouth-rinses prepared of palatable soup, milk or meat-juice prepared with unctuous, acid and salt articles.
55. Or some one else should be made to taste, in his presence, acid fruits so that his mouth may water in sympathy. If his tongue is protruded out, then smearing it with the paste of til and grapes, one should push it into position.
56. The wise physician should give in spasmodic condition of speech and in Vata-disorders, thin gruel prepared with ghee and flesh and also oleation and sudation therapy.
67. The patients who have undergone emesis [vamana] or purgation [virecana] or starvation or whose gastric fire is poor, should take the dietetic regimen of thin gruel etc., for the improvement of their digestive fire and vitality.
58 59. Medicine, given in too small a dose, to a person who has excess of morbidity or who is dehydrated or. whose gastric fire is weak or who suffers from misperistalsis, will rouse the morbid humor and obstruct the body-channels and cause great distension of abdomen, pain in the back, side of the chest and head, and serious obstruction to breath, feces, urine and flatus,
60. Inunction, sudation, suppository and similar treatment, evacuative and unctuous enemata and all treatment curative of disorders of misperistalsis are recommended in the case of distension of abdomen.
61-62. Strong medication taken by a person who has taken the oleation therapy, who is hard-bowelled and who suffers from chyme morbidity or by a person who is emaciated, soft-bowelled, exhausted and is poor of vitality, reaches the rectum and eliminates morbid matter along with chyme and causes acute colic and griping pain accompanied with slimy and bloody discharge.
63. In conditions associated with, chyme-morbidity, starvation and digestive medication are recommended; and the diet should be of dry, hot and light articles; and in condition of emaciation, all measures of roborant therapy and medications prepared with drugs of the sweet group are recommended.
63½. If, even after the digestion of chyme, there is obstipation, medication with acid and alkali, and light diet are recommended.
64-65½. If in this condition there is excess of Vata, the patient may take ghee mixed with fulsee flowers and with pomegranate juice adding barley alkali or rock-salt. He should take as food, sour curds mixed with pomegranate bark and as his drink, he should take warm water mixed with the paste of deodar and til.
66-67. Or he may take the milk prepared with holy fig, gular fig, yellow barked fig and cadamba or he may be given a mucilageuous enema prepared with astringent, sweet and cooling drugs; or he may be given an unctuous enema prepared with liquorice.
68-70. Medicine given in a small dose to a person who has excessive morbidity, rouses the humors, causes frequent and scanty elimination and gives rise to pruritus, edema, dermatosis, heaviness of the body, impairment of the gastric fire, nausea, stiffness, anorexia and anemia. There occurs frequency of discharge. This complication may either be treated with sedative drugs or with emetics; or giving him oleation again, he should be administered a strong purgative and whem he is perfectly cleansed, he maybe given powders and medicated wines prepared with suitable meditations.
71. Owing to suppression of the urge in one who has taken the purificatory doge, the Vata and other humors, getting provoked and reaching the heart, cause severe cardiac spasm.
72-72½. The person becomes afflicted with hiccup, cough and pain in the side of the chest; he gets de pressed; there is dribbling from the mouth; agitation of the eyes; he bites his tongue, falls unconscious and gnashes bis teeth. As this condition is serious, the physician should immediately make him vomit.
73-74. If the fainting is due to excess of Pitta, emesis [vamana] should be given prepared with drugs of the sweet group, and if due to Kapha; drugs of the pungent group should be used. Thereafter, the residual morbidity should be digested away by digestive medications. Then his body heat and vitality should be systematically rehabilitated.
75. If the person, while vomiting excessively, is afflicted in his heart by Vata, he should be given unctuous, acid and salt articles; and in condition due to Pitta-cum-Kapha, dry, pungent and bitter articles should be given.
76-77. By suppression of the urges by a person who has taken the purificatory dose or owing to obstruction of Vata by Kapha, or owing to purification done in excess, the provoked Vata seizes the limbs and causes Stiffness, tremor, pricking pain, asthenia, cramps and churning. In this condition, oleation, sudation and til similar other measures curative of Vata should be carried out.
78. If a very strong medication is given to a soft-bowelled person who has only slight morbidity, after eliminating the morbid matter and churning the system excessively, it causes the discharge of the live-blood.
79. Mixed with food, the blood should be thrown to dogs or crows to eat. If they eat it, it is live blood. If it is not eaten, declare it to be bile-blood,
80. A white cloth soaked in that blood and dried, should be washed with warm water. If the cloth retains the coloration, it is bile-blood. But if the cloth becomes clean and white then it is to be regarded as live-blood,
81. The physician should carry out treatment till the last moment of his life of the man who is afflicted with thirst, unconsciousness and intoxication. And his treatment should consist of measures curative of Pitta or the treatment beneficial in the over-action of the purificatory procedures.
82.He should be given to drink the fresh blood of a live deer, cow, buffalo or goat, so that his life becomes immediately supported by this life-giving procedure.
82½. Or he may be given that very blood churned with sacrificial grass in the form of an enema.
83-84. Or he may be given a cold enema of milk prepared with black turpeth, white teak, jujube, sacred grass and black cuscus and mixed with supernatant part of ghee and extract of berberry, or he may be given a very cold mucilagenous enema, or an unctuous enema prepared of the supernatant part of ghee.
85. If there occurs prolapse of rectum, it should be replaced after constricting it with astringent medication. In a condition of unconsciousness, soothing songs and words should be uttered.
86-87. If the purgative dose ceases to act immediately after elimination of the fecal matter or the emetic dose is immediately vomited out, it causes only the agitation of the morbid humor but does not eliminate it. Then the provoked humors cause pruritus and other diseases. This is called the condition of wrongful action of medication; and in this condition, treatment should be in accordance with the pathological features.
88. If a man who has undergone oleation procedure takes an unctuous potion, it gets covered up by the morbid matter which is in a softened condition and will be unable to expel the morbid matter from its habitat; it even obstructs those that have been dislodged from their habitats.
89. It causes scanty and frequent elimination accompanied with acute obstruction of Vata, rigidity and pain in the rectum. Such a man requires treatment by strong enemta or purgation [virecana] preceded by lightening and digestive measures.
90-91. The un-unctuous purgative medication, taken by one already lacking in the unctuous quality, or by one who is debilitated, will provoke the Vata quickly and give rise to severe complications. It causes rigidity and severe pain in all the limbs aud fainting. In such a condition, oleation, sudation and similar other measures as well as the line of treatment curative of Vata, are indicated.
92-93 A mild medication administered to one that has undergone the oleation procedure and who is soft-bowelled rouses up the Kapha and the Pitta and obstructs the Vata, and gives rise to torpor, heaviness, exhaustion and asthenia. In this condition, the patient should be made to vomit out the medication as well as the morbid matter. Then he should be given lightening and digestive remedies. Afterwards he should be given unctuous aud strong purificatory measures.
Summary
Here are the two recapitulatory verses—
94. Thus have been described along with their signs and symptoms and treatment, the complications arising from the procedures of emesis [vamana] and purgation [virecana] done by unskilled physicians.
95. The wise physician, versed in the correct pathology and stages of these conditions, should administer properly the purificatory procedures with a view always to completely restore the health of the patient.
6. Thus, in the Section on Success in Treatment, in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the sixth chapter entitled ‘The Success in Treatment of Complications arising from the Procedures of Enema and Purgation [vamana-virecana-vyāpad-siddhi]’, not being available, the same as restored by Dridhabala, is completed.
Twelve Complications and their Treatment
5-6. ‘Inadequate action, over-action, exhaustion, distension of abdomen, hiccup, cardiac disorder, excessive upward mounting of the enema, diarrhea, headache, body-ache, griping pain and excessive discharge—these twelve, are the possible complications arising from the improper use of the enema. Hear now the symptoms and treatment of each of these separately.
7-9. The enema [basti] given to a hard-bowelled person or to a person with predominance of Vata, or to a dehydrated person or to a person with provoked Vata; the enema which is given cold or prepared with an insufficiency of salt, unctuous substance or drugs; the enema which is very dense; the enema [basti] of this description will only stir up the morbid nutter without eliminating it owing to its weak action. It will consequently produce heaviness of the alimentary tract and retention of flatus, urine and feces, pain in the umbilical aud hypogastric regions, burning, increased mucus secretion in the stomach, edema of the anorectal region, pruritus, onchoma, discoloration, anorexia and dullness of the gastric fire.
10. In these conditions a warm potion of digestive decoctions, various methods of sudation, suppositories prepared of emetic nut or at the light time the administration of purgation are recommended.
11. The enema [basti] prepared of bael root, turpeth, deodar bark, barley, jujube, horse gram, Sura and other wines and cow’s urine mixed with the medicinal paste described earlier will draw out the morbid matter.
12 The enema which is given to a person who has previously been subjected to oleation and sudation and who is soft-bowelled, and the enema which is prepared with strong and hot medications will produce over action. The symptoms and treatment of this condition will be similar to those given in over-action of purificatory procedures.
13-14. To relieve the burning sensation induced by the over-action, the physician should give an enema prepared with the paste of painted-leaved tick-trefoil, lotus, white teak, liquorice, sida, grapes, or mahwa in milk or rice water or the cold infusion of grapes or of baked earth or of liquorice, mixed with ghee.
15-16. If there is a residue of chyme and then evacuative enema given is mild, the stirring up of the morbid matter obstructs the course of Vata, impairs the gastric fire and also provokes the Vata and causes exhaustion, burning, cardiac pain, stupefaction, cramps and heaviness. The physician should treat this condition with dry method of sudation and digestive medication.
17. The patient may drink the water medicated with long pepper, ginger grass, cuscus, deodar, and trilobed virgin’s bower mixed with sanchal salt. This is digestive stimulant and cleanses the stomach.
48. Or the patient may drink whey mixed with sweet flag, dry ginger, long zedoary and small cardamom in conjunction with Prasanna wine or medicated or simple wines
19-20. Or the patient may take as potion the pulp of deodar, the three spices, chebulic myrobalans, Palas, white flowered leadwort and costus mixed with cow’s urine, or he may take a potion of alkali which is digestive stimulant. Or he may be given enema prepared with decaradices in cow’s urine, or an enema [basti] prepared of honey and oil mixed with cow’s urine and well salted.
21-22½. The enema [basti] of a poor potency given in conditions of great morbidity, dehydration or to a low-bowelled person, gets covered up by the accumulated morbid matter and becomes clogged in the channels, causing obstruction to the movement of the Vata, This obstructed Vata flowing in a wrong course, causes distension of abdomen, pressure on the vital organs, burning, heaviness of the alimentary tract, pain in the scrotum and groin, and impedes the action of the heart and causes pain running about here and there irregularly.
23-25. Take emetic nut, turpeth and the other drugs of that group, costus, long pepper, rock-salt, rape seed, kitchen soot, flour of black gram, sweet flag, yeast and barley, alkali; mix this with gur and prepare a suppository of the size of a thumb and of the shape of a barley seed and smearing it with oil, insert it in the lubricated anus of the person who has been previously treated with inunction and sudation. Or a suppository prepared of rock salt, kitchen soot and rape-seed may also be used.
26.Or the patient may be given eyacuative enema prepared of bael and the other drugs of its group, toothbrush tree, rape-seed and cow’s urine; and he may then be administered an unctuous enema prepared with long leaved pine and deodar.
27. A very strong enema given to a weak and soft-bowelled person will eliminate over much and cause hiccup. In this condition, treatment which is curative of hiccup and roborant is advised.
28. The patient may be given an unctuous enema of the oil prepared with the paste of sida, tick trefoil and other drugs of its group, white teak, the three myrobalans, gur and rock salt along with Prasanna wine and gour conjee.
29. Or the patient may take the pulvis of long pepper and rock salt of the measure of one tola, with warm water. Inhalations, linctus, meat-juices, milk, sudation and foods that are curative of Vata are also recommended.
30-31. Enema [basti], strongly medicated or containing air bubbles or improperly compressed, will afflict the heart. In this condition, the evacuative enema prepared with the decoction of thatch grass, sacrificial grass, and Itkata [itkaṭa] grass, the drugs of the sour and salt groups, common caper and jujube are beneficial. This should be followed by an unctuous enema prepared with drugs curative of Vata.
32. If after the enema has been given, the urge of the flatus, urine and feces is suppressed, or if the enema is given with great pressure, the forceful flow of the fluid may find its way out through the oral cavity.
33-34½. On observing the unctuous condition in the patient, induced by this complication, his face should be immediately washed with cold water, and the sides, abdomen and the nether parts laved with cold water and the patient should be continually fanned. In extreme cases, it may be necessary to hold the patient by his hair, in mid air and shake him and also frighten him by means of infuriated bulls, asses, elephants and lions or the executioners of the king, serpents, fire-works and such other fearful things. When the patient is terrified in this m inner, the aberrant flow of the enema will return to its normal downward course.
35-36. Or in certain eases it may be necessary to apply pressure round the neck of the patient by a tight grip of the hand or a piece of cloth taking care, of course, to see that patient is not asphyxiated to death. In this way, in consequence of the blockage of the channels of the upward moving Prana and Udana, the Apana Vata regaining the normal downward tendency, quickly pushes the enema fluid d own.
37. At this stage, in order to help the peristaltic movement, the patient should be given to drink one tola of the paste of Pathan lodh mixed with sour articles. These drugs, by virtue of their being hot, acute and diffusive, will help to draw the enema fluid downwards,
38. If the enema fluid is lodged in the colon, the patient should be sweated and given an evacuative enema of barley, jujube and horse gram prepared with cow’s urine.
38½. If the enema fluid is lodged higher up in the thoracic region,the evacuative enema to be given should be prepared with the penta-radices of the bael group
39. If the enema fluid is lodged still higher in the head, then nasal medications, inhalations and anointing of the head with the paste of rapeseed should be resorted to.
40-41. When a mild and insufficiently medicated eneta is given to a patient who is suffering from heavy accumulation of morbid matter, the oleation and sudation procedures, followed by such an enema [basti] will stir up the morbid matter and eliminate it only partially, thus setting up a tendency to diarrhea. One afflicted with this complication, suffers from frequency of stools resulting from the swelling of the bladder and the rectum, or from asthenia of the shanks and the thighs.
42. The line of treatment in such a condition consists of sudation, inunction and evacuative enema medicated with purificatory drugs and drugs inducive of correct peristalsis. Then after the patient ins undergone the lightening procedure, he should be put on the dietetic regimen laid down for those who have undergone purgation.
43-44½. When an enema [basti] which is too thin, mild, cold or insufficient in quantity is given to a person who is debilitated, hard-bowelled and suffering from severe morbidity, it gets choked by the morbid accumulations The enema fluid thus blocked, presses on the Vata which gets provoked and courses wildly through the body-channels and is obstructed in the cranium. Thus checked, it renders the neck and its sides rigid and causes cutting pain in the throat and the head. As a result deafness, tinnitus, coryza and agitation of the eyes are induced.
45-46. In such conditions, inunction with oil and rock salt in conformity with the rules laid down are advised. The patient should be further treated with insufflations or nasal medications and inhalations or errhines. Then, after he has been made to eat pungent and peristalsis-inducing articles of food, he should be oleated and administered an unctuous enema.
47-49. If a patient is given an excessive dose of a heavy and acute enema without his being first prepared with the oleation and sudation procedures, the enema [basti] so administered will cause excessive elimination. When the excretory matter has thus been eliminated in an excessive measure by the evacuative enema, the patient’s gastro-intestinal tract becomes rigid and an upward peristalsis is set up, with the result that the course of Vata is impeded. On account of this abnormal course of Vata, the patient is afflicted in his limbs with various kinds of pain such as girdle pain, pricking pain, breaking pain, throbbing pain and stretching pain.
50. In such conditions, the patient [? could?] be anointed with salted oil and affused with hot water. He should then be sweated with decoctions of the leaves of the castor-plant and with hot-bed method of sudation.
51-53. He should then be given an evacuative enema prepared with barley, black-gram and jujube and the two kinds of penta-radices in 512 tolas of water till the water is reduced to one fourth its original quantity and mixed with the paste of bael, warm oil and salt When he has been administered this evacuative enema and comforted, he should be given an immersion bath in a tub. After that he should be made by the physician to eat and immediately on completing his meal, he should be given an unctuous enema with oil medicated with liquorice or with the oil medicated with bael.
54-55. If an enema which is unctuous, acute and excessive in dose is given to a soft-bowelled person suffering from slight morbidity causing precipitous elimination of the morbid matter, it gives rise to an all round shooting pain in the abdomen. The patient in this condition is afflicted with pricking pains in the sacrum, groins and the bladder, and pain in the region below the navel, obstipation and frequent urge with scanty evacuation due to the very strong and irritating action of the enema fluid.
56. In the condition, treatment consists of the administration of an enema consisting of milk prepared with sweet and cooling drugs such as sugarcane etc., and which has been mixed with the paste of liquorice and til. The patient should be kept on milk diet.
57. Or the patient may be given an enema of milk prepared with calophany, liquorice, Indian ash tree, Kardama and Indian berberry, after the patient is put on an acid and soft diet.
58-59. If an enema [basti] which is very acid or hot or acute or salt, is given to a person suffering from Pitta disorders, the enema irritates, injures and inflames the anal tract. The anus thus inflamed exudes blood and Pitta of various colors, flows out with a great force at frequent intervals, and the man faints.
60 In such a conditon, a cold enema of goat’s milk, in which have been boiled triturated bits of green stalks of silk cotton tree and to which has been added a quantity of ghee, should be given.
61. This method of preparing the enema is. also recommended in the case of banyan and other drugs of its group, or in the case of barley and til with heliotrope and Indian spinach as also with white mountain ebony.
62. In addition, affusion of the anus, applications prepared with old and sweet drugs, and procedures advised in hemothermia and diarrhea, are recommended.
63. An enema [basti] should be made acute when so required in a given condition by the addition of cow’s urine, tooth brush tree, white-flowered lead-wort, salts, alkalis and rape seed; and it should be made mild when so required by the addition of milk etc.
The cleansing effect of the Enema [basti]
64. The enema [basti], when living the colon draws by its potency, the morbid matter lodged in the entire body from the foot to the head, just as the sun situated in the sky sucks up the moisture from the earth.
65. Again, just as the cloth sucks up the pigment from the water dyed with the safflower, even so, the evacuative enema sucks up and eliminates the morbid matter from the body which has been prepared by the liquifacient procedures of oleation aud sudation.
Summary
Here is the recapitulatory verse—
66. Thus have been described the complications arising from the administration of the enema, together with the clinical picture presented in each case and the appropriate remedial measures. The physician who administers the enema, after thoroughly acquainting himself with all this, is not liable to err.
7. Thus, in the Section on Success in Treatment, in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the seventh chapter entitled ‘The Success in Treatment of the Complications arising from the Administration of the Enema [basti-vyapad-siddhi]’ not being available, the same as restored by Dridhabala, is completed.
36 Varieties of Diarrhea and the Remedial recipes
19. If the patient is seen passing foul-smelling and undigested stools accompanied with colicky pain and. anorexia, he should drink a potion of nut-grass, atees, costus, Indian valerian, deodar and sweet flag.
20. If the patient passes excessively, digested stools flatus, blood, Pitta or Kapha, the enema prepared with suitable medicaments is the best remedial measure.
21. These six varieties of diarrhea are further sub-divided into thirty varieties, according to the various combinations of two morbid humors. These thirty together with the main six varieties make thirty-six varieties of diarrhea, along with their complications.
22. The physician should know colic, dysentery, meteorism, griping pain, anorexia, fever, thirst, stupefaction, burning, fainting etc., to be the complications of these various types of diarrhea.
23. When the patient passes undigested stools, a digestive potion pre pared with the three spices acids and salt is recommended, since, in this condition, administration of the enema is contra-indicated.
24. If there is provocation of Vata, the patient should be given the unctuous enema prepared with sweet, sour and salt groups of drugs.
25. If there is blood in the stools, enema of blood should be given; and in the case of provocation of Pitta, the enema prepared of astringent sweet and bitter groups of drugs, and if there is excessive mucus in the stools, the enema prepared of astringent, pungent and bitter groups of drugs should be given.
26. If the condition of lienteric diarrhea is associated with fecal matter or flatus, or if the condition of feculent diarrhea or diarrhea due to Vata morbidity is associated with undigested stools, the treatment consists of a digestive potion of the three spices and the drugs of the acid and salt groups.
27. If the condition of lienteric diarrhea is associated with bile or blood or if the condition of bilious or sanguinous diarrhea is associated with undigested stools, the treatment consists of a potion of the three spices aud the drugs of the sweet and the bitter groups
28. If the condition of lienteric diarrhea is associated with mucus, the treatment consists of a potion of the three spices and the drugs of the astringent and the bitter groups
29. If the conditions of feculent or bilious diarrhea is associated with flatus, or if the condition of diarrhea of Vata is associated with fecal matter or bile, the best line of treatment is the administration of an enema prepared of the drugs of the sweet, acid and astringent groups.
30. If fecal matter and blood, or bile and fecal matter, or blood and bile, or fecal matter and blood and bile, are found mutually associated in the conditions of diarrhea, the treatment consists in the administration of an enema prepared of the drugs of the astringent, sweet and bitter groups.
31. If the condition of feculent diarrhea or biHous diarrhea is associated with mucus in stools or if the diarrhea due to Kapha is associated with fecal matter, bile or blood in stools, the best line of treatment consists in the administration of an enema prepared of the three spices and the drugs of the bitter and the astringent groups.
32. If the condition of diarrhea due to Kapha is associated with flatus, the treatment consists in the administration of an enema prepared of the three spices and the drugs of the bitter and acid groups; while if the condition of sanguinous diarrhea is associated with mucus in stools, the treatment consists in the administration of an enema prepared of the three spices and the drugs 'of the sweet and bitter groups.
33. If the diarrhea due to Vata is associated with mucus in stools, the treatment consists in the administration of an enema prepared of the three spices and the drugs of the sweet and the salt groups; while if the condition of sanguinous diarrhea is associated with flatus in stools, the treatment consists in the administration of an enema prepared of the drugs of the sweet, acid and bitter groups.
34. in this manner, in combination of three, four or five morbid factors, the corresponding combination of therapeutic measures should be determined. this methodology enunciated with reference to diarrhea is applicable mutatis mutandis in all disease-conditions.
35. When all the six morbific factors are found in combination, a digestive potion consisting of all the six tastes should be used; when five of the six conditions except that of chyme are involved, the epema consisting of all the six tastes should be given.
36-37½. Take four tolas each of the unripe fruits of gular fig, the barks of jambul, mango and gular fig, conch, sal resin, lac and Kardama and reducing the whole to paste, prepare with it 64 tolas of ghee adding double the quantity of milk. This medicated ghee may be given in all kinds of diarrhea, according to the vitality of the patient.
38. A medicated gruel, prepared of cowage, fulsee flowers, bael, sensitive plant, red rice, lentils and sprouts of holy fig with water may be given in conditions of diarrhea.
39.Similarly, a medicated gruel prepared of tender gular fig, Indian calosanthes, sensitive plant and sprouts of yellow-barked fig tree, lentils, fulsee flowers and heart-leaved sida may also be given.
40. Similarly, different medicated gruels may be prepared of lentils with the addition of the decoctions of any of the following groups of drugs viz., the ticktrefoil group, the sida group and the sugar-cane group.
41-42. Medicated gruels prepared of the roots of cowage, Shali and other kinds of rice or with curd, butter milk, sour conjee, acid, milk and sugar-cane should be given cold, mixed with sugar, honey, ghee and black pepper curing all kinds of diarrhea. These medicated gruels seasoned with ghee, black pepper, cumin seeds and sweet and salt articles, are wholesome and curative of all kinds of diarrhea.
Here are verses again—
43-45. In diarrhea due to Vata, the potion as well as the enema should be prepared of unctuous, acid, salt and sweet articles and should be taken lukewarm; in diarrhea due to Pitta and blood morbidity, both potion and enema should be prepared of bitter, astringent and sweet articles and should be taken cold; in diarrhea due to Kapha, drink and enema should be prepared of bitter, astringent and pungent articles and should be taken hot; in diarrhea due to fecal morbidity; the medication should be astringent and alleviative of Vata; in diarrhea due to chyme morbidity, digestive potions, should be drunk; in diarrhea characterised by blood in stools, the mucilagenous [mucilaginous?] enema, or blood enema should be given In this manner, we have indicated the various lines of treatment in diarrhea. In cases where the diarrhea is caused by the morbidity of more factors than one, the medication should consist of the appropriate combination of the various lines indicated. In these latter cases, the principle of treatment should be to treat the preponderant morbid factor first.
Summary
Here is the recapitulatory verse—
46. In this chapter on success by the use of enema consisting of the Prasrita measure, the teacher has described the various enemas in which the Prasrita measure is used; the complications arising from the use of mild enema, as also their treatment, evacuative enemas which are beneficial in conditions of diarrhea, and finally; the determination of medications.with reference to the six categories of taste; various medicated ghees and gruels
8. Thus, in the Section on Success in Treatment, in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the eighth chapter entitled ‘The Successful Treatment of Administration of the Prasrita Enema [prasritayoga-siddhi]’ not being available, the same as restored by Dridhabah, is completed.
Protection of Vital Regions
Here are verses again—
9. It is in the cardiac, cranial and pelvic regions that the life of men is established. Hence, constant effort for the protection of these should be made.
10. Such protection of the vital organs consists in the avoidance of the causes of injury to, them, constant adherence to the rules of the regimen of hygienic living and prompt treatment on the incidence of disease.
Pathology and Treatment of Vital Affections
11. I shall hereafter describe some disorders, along with their treatment, affecting the vital organs [trimarma] such as have not been described in the chapter on the Therapeutics of the Disorders affecting the Three Vital Regions.
12-13½. The Vata provoked by its specific causative factors, spreads upwards beyond its natural, habitat, afflicts the heart and reaching the head, afflicts the temples. It bends the body lite a bow and causes convulsions of the limbs and fainting. The patient breathes with difficulty and his eyes are fixed in a wide stare or are closed He coos like the pigeon and becomes unconscious. This condition is known as Apatantraka.
14-15. The eyes are fixed, the consciousness is lost and the patient makes a moaning noise from the throat. When this Vata is released from the heart, the man becomes normal again; but when again seized by the paroxysm he falls unconscious. This dreadful disorder is termed Apatanaka.
16-18. The breathing which has became obstructed by the Kapha and Vata must be relieved by acute nasal insufflations. When the channels conducting consciousness are freed, the man recovers his wits. To this end the patient should be given, in the form of errhines, long pepper, the seeds of drumstick, embelia and sweet marjoran, reduced to fine powder. In conditions of heart-seizure and tetanic convulsions, the patient should be made to drink a potion of Indian toothache, emblic myrobaian, asafoetida, orris root and the three salts prepared with barley-water.
19-20. Or the patient may be made to drink a potion prepared of asafoetida, Amlavetasa, dry ginger, sanchal salt and pomegranate juice. All procedures advised for the alleviation of Vata and Kapha morbidity are recommended in the alleviation of cardiac disorders. Thorough-going purificatory measures as well as enema of a strong action are contra-indicated. The patient may be given, with advantage, the medicated ghee prepared with sanchal salt, chebulic myrobalan with sanchal salt, chebulic myrobalan and the three spices.
21-22. When the Raphaels provoked by the Vata as a result of indulgence in sweet, unctuous and heavy articles of diet, or as a result of mental strain, fatigue and grief, or as a sequela of disease—when such Kapha reaches and covers up the cardiac region and the channels situated therein such as the knowledge-bearing channels etc., it gives rise to torpor.
23-24. The characteristics of torpor are said to be depression of the heart, heaviness of speech, movement and the senses, and clouding of the mind and the intellect. In such a condition, measures curative of Kapha, purificatory and sedative procedures, exercise, bloodletting and a diet of pungent and bitter articles are indicated.
25-26. The following thirteen are the urinary morbidities:—
1. Mutraukasada [mūtraukasāda] (Dense urine); 2. Mutrajathara [mūtrajaṭhara] (uro-celioncus); 3 Kricchra [kṛcchra] (dysuria); 4. Mutrotsanga [mūtrotsaṅga] (Residual urination); 5. Samkshaya [saṃkṣaya] (Suppression of urine); 6 Mutratita [mūtrātīta] (Delayed Micturition); 7. Vatashthila [vātāṣṭhīlā] (Stone hard tumor); 8. Vatabasti [vātabasti] (Vāta affection of the bladder); 9. Ushnamaruta [uṣṇamāruta] (Vāta-cum-Pitta condition); 10. Vatakundalika [vātakuṇḍalikā] (Circumgyratory Vāta in the bladder); 11. Raktagranthi (Blood tumor); 12. Vidghata [viḍghāta] (Fecal fistula); 13. Bastikundala [bastikuṇḍala] (circular distension of the bladder).
Hear now the symptoms of each of them.
27-28. When the Pitta and the Kapha are both combined in the bladder along with the Vata, the patient passes urine that is reddish, yellowish and thick. Or he may pass urine accompanied with burning and of a white and dense quality or urine showing a combination of all the qualities. This is to be known as Mutraukasada or dense urine and it should be treated with measures curative of Pitta and Kapha.
29-30. When in consequence of the suppression of the urge of micturition, the retarded urinal flow gets pushed upwards by the Vata and fills up the abdominal cavity, there is an indefinite pain accompanied with indigestion and retention of urine and feces. This condition is called ‘Mutra-jathara’ (uro-celioncus). In this condition diuretic measures should be resorted to
31. The compound urinary powder described in the chapter on ‘The three vital regions [trimarma]’ will cure this uro-abdominal condition as well as constipation and distension of the rectum and the phallus.
32. When a man, while under the urge for micturition, performs the sexual act, the seminal fluid discharged arid ejected by Vata will either precede or follow the flow of urine. This condition is called ‘Kricchra’ or difficult micturition.
33.When in consequence of the abnormality of the urinary outlet, and [? of?] the large and heavy size of the phallus, the urinal flow ejected by Vata is retained in part and accumulated in the region of the glans penis, subsequently this residual urine dribbles out accompanied either with severe or no pain. This condition of stammering urination is called ‘Mutra-utsanga’ or residual urination
34. When the urinary secretion dries up owing to excessive Vata, there is induced a condition called ‘Samkshaya’ or suppression of urine characterised by symptoms of Vata morbidity.
35 When a man habitually given to long withholding of the urge for urination performs the act of micturition, the flow does not start immediately or flows out very slowly; this condition is called ‘Mutratita’ or delayed micturition.
36. When the Vata, being obstructed, distends the bladder and the rectum, it gives rise to the formation of the condition called Ashthila (stone-hard tumor) which is movable, elevated, acutely painful and obstructive of the urinary and rectal passages.
37.In a person who is habitually suppressing the urge for micturition, the Vata in the bladder becomes provoked owing to suppression of its action and causes retention of urine, pain and itching sensation in the bladder. This is called the Vata disease of the bladder.
38. The Vata, combining with the heat of Pitta, beats up the urine, dries it up, turns it red and yellowish in color. This Ushna-Vata or Vata-cum-Pitta disease gives rise to difficult urination accompanied with pain and burning in the bladder and the phallus.
39-40. Owing to clogging in the urinary passages, the Vata is turned upwards and thus its motion, becoming broken and vitiated, it assumes either a crooked or circum-gyratory motion in the bladder as well as in the urinary channels. It then vitiates the urinary function, giving rise to rigidity, breaking pain, heaviness, girdle pain,severe colic and retention of urine and feces. This condition is termed Vata-kundalika or cirum-gyratory Vata disorder of the bladder.
41-41½. The blood vitiated by the Vata and the Kapha causes a serious kind of tumor in the neck of the bladder. Owing to the obstruction thus caused, the man passes urine with difficulty and pain, similar to that felt in the condition of stone in the urinary passage. This condition is known as the ‘Rakta-granthi’ or blood-tumor in the bladder.
42-43. When the morbid Vata enters the urinary passage, the person then passes with difficulty urine that is mixed with fecal matter and which is foul-smelling. This condition is to be known as ‘Vid-vighata’ or fecal fistula.
44-46. By excessive running, wayfaring, jumping, exertion, trauma or compression, the bladder is displaced upwards, and becoming enlarged, it appears like the gravid uterus. The patient getting afflicted with colic, throbbing and buring [burning?] pain, passes urine drop by drop. When the bladder region is pressed, the urine comes out in a jet. This condition is characterised by rigidity and girdle pain and is termed ‘Basti-kundala’ or circular distension of the bladder. It is a dreadful condition comparable in seriousness to injury by weapon or poisoning. It is generally caused by predominant morbidity of Vata and cannot be cured by the mediocre physician.
46½. If the condition is accompanied with Pitta morbidity, there will be burning, colic and varied coloration of urine.
47. While if accompanied with Kapha-morbidity, there will be heaviness, swelling and unctuous, dense and pallid condition of the urine.
48. Where the orifice of the bladder gets obstructed by Kapha and where [? there?] is provocation of Pitta too it does not yield to treatment. If the orifice of the bladder is not displaced, the condition is curable; but if it is twisted round and displaced, the condition is incurable.
48½. When the bladder is twisted and displaced, there will occur cardiac distress, fainting and dyspnea
49-49½. Diagnosing the predominance of the morbid humor, these conditions should be treated by measures curative of dysuria. Enemata and urethral douches should be administered in all morbid conditions of the bladder.
50-51. The catheter should be of gold or silver and smooth, and the tip must be of the size of the stalk of a jasmine or oleander flower and tapering in shape like the cow’s tail. It must have a hole of the size of a mustard seed. Its length must be twelve fingers breadth and it must be provided with two ears.
52. This should be attached to a goat’s bladder and the unctuous medication given through it must be two tolas in measure; or the dose administered may be in keeping with the age and other conditions of the patient.
53-55. The patient should have bathed, taken his food mixed with meat-juice or milk; and should have voided his feces and urine. He should be seated on a knee-high and soft seat in a straight and comfortable position. His phallus should be made erect and the probe, smeared with ghee, should be inserted into the urethra. If the probe can be passed without any obstruction, then the catheter should be introduced according to the size of the phallus (in the line of perineal raphe) and in the same manner as that described about the enema nozzle for the anus.
55-56½. If it penetrates too far, it hurts; and if insufficiently inserted, the unctuous medication does not reach its destination. Then, compressing the douche bladder without shaking it and without causing discomfort to the patient, the douche-tube, i.e,. the catheter, should be withdrawn. After the fluid has returned, a second and third douche should be given.
57-61. If it does not return, it may be ignored for a night. If it has not returned after a night, prepare a suppository with long pepper, rock salt, kitchen-smoke, rough chaff, rape-seed, the juice of brinjal, chaste tree, purging cassia and crested purple nail dye rubbed into paste with cow’s urine and acid article and mixed with gur. The suppository should be of the size of the mustard seed at the tip and of the black-gram seed at the base. It should be of the length of the catheter and soft and unbreakable. It should be lubricated with ghee and inserted in the manner of the catheter into the urethral passage, and another suppository of the size of a thumb should be inserted into the anus, After the unctuous fluid has returned from both the urethra and the anus, the after treatment laid down in the case of the unctuous enema should be followed. The after-care complications and characteristics of a successful administration of the urethral douche are the same as those described regarding unctuous enemas
62-62½. For women, this douchetherapy should be given during their menstrual period, as the mouth of the uterus is open at the time and readily receives the fluid injected. If the Vata is thus subdued, the uterus becomes readily impregnable.
63-64½. The douche prepared with appropriate medications should be administered in disorders of the bladder, prolapse of the uterus, severe uterine colic, other gynecic disorders, menorrhagia, stasis of urine and in conditions of incontinence where the urine dribbles drop by drop.
65-65½. The catheter in the case of women should be ten fingers’ breadth in length. Its circumference should be of the size of the urethral canal and the channel of the catheter should be large enough to allow the free passage of a green-gram seed.
66-66½. It should be inserted into the vagina upto a depth of four fingers’ breadth and upto two fingers’ breadth in the urethra in the case of an adult woman. While in the case of tender girls, the catheter should be introduced only upto one fingers’ breadth in the urethra.
67-68½. This should be done when the woman is lying in bed in a supine position with the thighs well flexed, The catheter should be introduced in the line of the curve of the spinal column and in such a way that no discomfort is caused to the patient. Two, three or four unctuous douches should be injected in the course of a day and night into the bladder. The suppository to be used for-getting the injected fluid to return should be thicker than the catheter.
69-69½. This treatment should be done for three nights with gradual increase of the dose of the unctuous medication. In the same manner, treatment should be repeated after an interval of three days.
70. Hereafter we shall describe some varieties of the diseases affecting the head.
71-72. When the vitiated blood, Pitta and Vata combine together and affect the temple region, they will cause an acute and fulminating condition attended with severe pain, burning, redness and swelling. Spreading rapidly like an acute poison, it causes obstruction in the head and throat, and kills the patient in three days. This disease is called by the name of Shankhaka [śaṅkhaka] or facial cellulitis.
73. If the patient survives the three critical days, the physician, after making it known that treatment may not yet be efficacious should administer errhines, affusions and such other medications as are indicated in acute spreading affections.
74-76. The Vata, getting provoked by addiction to dry articles or excess of diet or eating on a loaded stomach, by easterly winds, fog, excessive sexual indulgence, suppression of natural urges, strain or over-exertion, either alone or in combination with Kapha, seizes the one half of the head and causes acute neuralgic pain in the sides of the neck, eye-brow, temple, ear, eye, or forehead of one Side. This pain is very agonizing like that caused by a churning rod or (red hot needle). This disease is called Ardhavabhedaka [ardhāvabhedaka] or hemicrania. If the condition becomes aggravated, it may even impair the functions of the eye and ear.
77-78, The maximum doses of the tetrad of unctuous preparations, the purification of the head and body, steam-kettle sudation, ingestion of old ghee, unctuous and evacuative enemas, poultices and unctuous head-packs and cauterization are recommended in this condition, as also is whatever prescribed in coryza and diseases of the head
79-80¾. The blood and the Vata getting vitiated by the suppression of natural urges, indigestion and similar factors, in turn vitiate the brain. The brain, thus vitiated, combining with the vitiated humors, causes the following disorders. After sunrise, the morbid matter gets liquified by the sun-heat and begins to flow out gradually; and as the day advances the headache continues to increase; and after the sun begins to go down the liquid gets congealed in the head and the pain ceases. This disease is called Suryavarta [sūryāvarta], a variety of neuralgia.
81-83. The treatment of this condition is by post-prandial potion of ghee, purification of the head and body, head-packs with the triad of unctuous articles, poultices with the flesh of Jangala animals, affusions with ghee and milk, and nasal medications with ghee extracted from the milk prepared with the flesh of peacock, partridge, quail or other game birds, prepared again in eight times its quantity of milk along with the paste of the drugs of the life-promoter group.
84-85½. All the three humors, when provoked by fasting, excessive grief or by taking very dry, old and scanty articles of food, cause acute neuralgic pain in the sides and the nape of the neck; then the pain becomes localized in the eye, the eye-brow and temple and causes throbbing of the cheeks and the sides of the face, disorders of the eyes and trismus. This condition is called Ananta Vata [anantavāta] or [? tic doulouren?] (major trigeminal neuralgia). It can be cured by venisection and by the treatment indicated in Suryavarta.
86-87. The Vata, getting vitiated by dry diet and similar factors causes shaking of the head (shaking palsy). In this condition, oleation, sudation etc. and demulcent nasal medication prepared with guduch, sida, Indian groundsel, white siris, and winter cherry, which are curative of Vata are recommended.
88. The expert physician should administer the nasal therapy in the diseases of the head, as the nose is the gateway of the head; the medications given through the nose pervade everywhere in the head and allay head-diseases.
89. The nasal therapy, it should be known, comprises of the five procedures of inunction, nasal drops, insufflation, inhalation and application.
90. Nasal inunction is said to have two actions viz. oleation and purification. The nasal drops are said to have two actions: purificatory and astringent.
91-92. And the insufflation of powder brings about the purification of the nasal passages Inhalation should be known to be of the threefold method such as sedative etc. as previously described. Application is made of unctuous substance which is harmless in use and which serves both the purposes of oleation and purification Thus these procedures maybe classified into three groups viz., purification, impletion and sedation.
93. Nasal medications for -the purpose of purification of the head are recommended in stiffness, numbness, heaviness and similar diseases of the head, arising from morbid Kapha.
94. Demulcent nasal medication for the purpose of soothing the head is recommended in shaking palsy-facial palsy and other disorders born of Vata.
95. The sedative nasal medication is recommended in hemothermia and similar conditions. Insufflation and smoking are recommended in required conditions. (On fully investigating the morbidity etc., the physician should carry out the treatment as indicated).
96-97½. The physician may prepare errhine-powder from the various drugs described as errhine drugs The unctuous purificatory errhine-medication may be prepared from this powder and the unctuous demulcent nasal medications may be prepared from the drugs of the sweet group described previously. With the medications thus prepared, the specialist should carry out the nasal therapy.
98-99½. The intelligent physician should administer the demulcent nasal medications, either in the morning or in the noon, to the patient who has previously attended to the necessary acts of ablution and has been made to lie at his ease in the supine position on a well-spread couch, with his head hanging down slightly and the feet slightly raised.
100-102½ If the head is not lowered at all, the nasal medication does not reach the desired destination. If on the mother hand it is lowered too much, there is the danger of the medication getting lodged in the brain; hence the patient should be made to assume the position described, and by way of preparatory cleansing, his head should be subjected to sudation Having carried out the sudation procedure, the physician should with the thumb of his left hand, raise the tip of the patient’s nose and with the right hand he should drop, either by means of pipette or cotton swab, the sternutatory oil in equal measure in both the nostrils in the way prescribed.
103-105. On completing this, the patient’s head should be once again subjected to sudation and the oil that has been dropped should be repeatedly drained out together with the morbid mucus till no portion of the medicated oil is left behind The mucus roused by the sudation and collected during the administration of the errhine treatment, becomes congealed in the head once again as a result of the cooling effect of the unctuous article. It then gives rise to disorders of the ear, sides of the neck, throat etc.
106-106¼. Hence the patient should after the errhine treatment resort to smoking that is curative of Kapha, take wholesome diet, resort to windless and warm apartments and observe sense restraint. This is the method to be employed in the administration of nasal drops.
107-110. As regards insufflation, the powder should be blown by the mouth through a tube of six fingers’ breadth in length. After the patient has been errhinated, he should be given a potion of hot water and then a light meal which is not aggravative of any of the three humors, and should be made to remain in a windless place by the vigilant physician. If a man that has been purged of the impurities, resorts again to things causative of humoral provocation, the particular humor provoked, moving about in that region gives rise to many diseases peculiar to its nature. In these conditions the wise physician should carry out treatment as indicated; and as regards complications arising from untimely nasal therapy, the line of treatment is the same as that in corresponding diseases.
111-112. Unctuous nasal medication administered in indigestion or immediately after meals or after taking a draught of water or on a cloudy day or in condition of recent coryza or after a bath or after an unctuous potion or after an unctuous enema, will give rise to various disorders of Kapha. In such disorders, all measures curative of Kapha, such as are acute, hot, etc., are beneficial.
113-115. By the administration of dry nasal medication in conditions of emaciation or after-purgation or in gravid condition or in fatigue due to exertion and in thirst, the Vata, getting provoked, causes disorders peculiar to its nature. In such conditions, all measures curative of Vata such as oleation, or roborant and sudation therapies etc., should be given; and in the case of a gravida, ghee and milk should be specially given. The unctuous nasal medication causes dimness of vision in the case of persons greatly afflicted with fever or grief and also in those addicted to wine. In such cases painting the eye with un-unctuous and cooling collyrium, applications and medications prepared by the Putapaka-method should be done.
116. There are two purposes served by nasal medication viz., oleation and purification. Nasal application serves both purposes and is harmless.
117. Morning and night, and in all seasons, one should use a finger dipped in unctuous substance for nasal inunction. The medication should not be sniffed in too deeply. This nasal application is to be used in health and it is promotive of firmness and strength.
Summary
Here are the two recapitulatory verses—
118-119. Of the vital regions why three are pre-eminent; the signs and symptoms and treatment of injuries occurring in these regions;the different varieties of diseases affecting these organs and their remedies; the method of administration of the urethral and vaginal douches and similarly the method of administering nasal medication; the complications and their treatment, have all been described in this chapter entitled Success in Treatment of the ‘Three Vital Regions’.
9. Thus, in the Section on Success in Treatment, in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the ninth chapter entitled ‘Success in Treatment of the Complications arising from the Disorders affecting the Three Vital Regions in the body [trimarma-sddhi]’, not being available, the same as restored by Drdhabala, is completed.
Qualities of Enema [basti]
5. There is no therapeutic procedure comparable to that of the enema [basti] in as much as it possesses rapid and useful properties of cleansing, in addition to its being a quick agent of impletion and depletion and.is unattended with danger.
6. Although purgation does eliminate morbid matter, the oral ingestion of drugs containing as they do pungent, acute and hot and such other properties, tends to produce such unpleasant side-effects as cause distress, eructations, nausea, unpleasantness and pain in the gastro-intestinal tract.
7-7½. Moreover, since the very young and the very aged are both unsuitable subjects for purgation, on account of the former having not yet attained full body-growth and vitality and the latter having begun to lose both, the corrective enema-procedure is in both cases the most suitable procedure and the one that can achieve all the desired results Thus, the enema [basti] invests persons quickly with strength, complexion, exhilaration, softness and nnctuousness of the body.
Varieties of Enema [basti]and their Applications
8-9. The enema [basti] is of three kinds viz., unctuous, evacuative and urethro-vaginal douching. The enema is especially beneficial in persons afflicted with rheumatic affections of the extremities, contracture, softness, fracture and pain.
10. Patients afflicted with heat, should be given cold enemas while those afflicted with cold should be given genially warm enemas. The enema should be given prepared with the appropriate medicaments judging each case on its own merits.
11. Roborant enema should not be given in cases requiring purificatory treatment such as persons who are obese or afflicted with dermatosis, urinary anomalies, or in cases needing to be rid of putrid humors or in cases of skin and urinary diseases.
12. The use of the purificatory measures are contraindicated in persons with cachexia, pectoral lesions, debility, fainting, emaciation and dehydration of the body, as well as in those whose life is sustained to some extent by the excretory matter in the body.
13. For the purpose of virilification and in disorders of blood and Pitta, the enemas prepared with honey, ghee and milk are recommended. In morbid conditions of Kapha and Vata, enemas prepared with til oil, cow’s urine, sour conjee and rock salt are beneficial.
14. In the preparation of the enema solution, such substances should be used from among acid articles, urines, milks, wines and decoctions as are not antagonistic to the body-elements, and water, being the source the nutrient fluid, should be warm.
15-16. Deodar, dill seeds, small cardamom, costus, liquorice, long pepper, honey and unctuous substance, drugs acting as purificatory of upper and lower channels, rape-seed, sugar and salt are the ingredients to be added to the enema solution. As to which of these ingredients should be used in which kind of enema and with what kind of decoction will be described hereafter.
17. In disease-conditions which are chronic, obstinate and severe, strong, unctuous or evacuative enema prepared with suitable ingredients and decoction, should be used, while in the opposite conditions, i.e., mild or recent condition of disease, mild enema should be used.
18. Listen to me as I now describe, a prescription in each hemistich a number of tried prescriptions of enemas [basti] suitable for administration in all varieties of disease-conditions. In these prescriptions, the relative proportion of the drugs to be mixed together should be such that the potency of any one drug is not neutralized by that of any other.
19-20. (1) Bael, wind killer, Indian calosanthes, fruits of white teak and trumpet flower; (2) Tick trefoil, painted leaved uraria, the two varieties of Indian nightshade and castor oil plant; (3) Barley, horse-gram, Indian jujube, tick trefoil; these three sets of drugs comprising three distinct prescriptions should be prepared with the addition of the tetrad of unctuous articles and meat-juices and administered in morbid conditions due to Vata.
21-22. (1) Great reed, country willow, cane, lotus and moss; (2) Indian madder, the two varieties of Indian sarsaparilla, milky yam, and liquorice; (3) Sandalwood, Himalayan cherry, cuscus grass, and fragrant poon; these three sets of drugs making the second triad of prescriptions, are to be given combined with sugar, honey, ghee and milk and are indicated as enema [basti] in disease conditions due to Pitta.
23-24. (1) The two varieties of mudar, Patha, and hog’s weed; (2) Turmeric, the three myrobalans, nutgrass, Indian berberry and Indian valerian; (3) Long pepper and white flowered leadwort; these three sets of drugs, making the third triad of prescriptions, should be used mixed with alkali, honey and cow’s urine and a slight quantity of unctuous substance. These enemas are recommended in disease-conditions due to Kapha.
25-27. (1) Emetic nut, bristly luffa, bottle gourd, sponge gourd, bitter luffa and kurchi; (2) Black turpeth, the three myrobalans, tick trefoil, red physic nut and physic nut, (3) Indian beech, prickly brazil wood, indigo plant, and asthma weed; (4) Soap-pod, clenolepis, lodh and the fruit of Kamala, these four sets of drugs prepared with cow's urine are purificatory of the colon. (The drugs above mentioned may be used separately or in combination and they make a tetrad of prescriptions.)
28-29. (1) Kakoli, Ksirakakoli, wild bean and climbing asparagus; (2) white yam, liquorice, Indian water chest-nut and luffa; (3) the fruit of the cowage, black gram, wheat and barley; (4) And the meat of the aquatic wet-land animals; these four sets of drugs are promotive of the seminal secretion as well as of flesh.
30-31. (1) Cork swallow wort, wind killer, fulsee flower and kurchi; (2) Purging cassia, catechu, costus, Shami, emetic nut and barley; (3) Perfumed cherry, Indian madder, double jasmine and yellow jasmine; (4) The banyan and the other drugs of its group, Palas and the lodh; these four sets of drugs are known to be astringent in their action,
32. (1) Milk prepared with white hogs weed and hog’s weed; (2) Or with kidney leaved ipomea and prickly amaranth is indicated in hemorrhage conditions.
33.(1). Negro coffee, big sugarcane, sacrificial grass, elephant grass and sugar cane; (2) The blue water lily and other aquatic plants of its group; ghee or milk, prepared with either of these two sets of drugs, is curative of burning.
34-35. White mountain ebony, pigeon pea, Kadamba and hijjal tree should be prepared in milk with honey and sugar, and given as a cold enema, by the physician, in griping or colicky pain.. Similarly an enema [basti] prepared with the stalks of white teak and variegated mountain ebony may be given as enema, in the same condition by good physicians who have a correct knowledge of the therapeutic methods.
36-(1). The stalks of silk cotton tree prepared in milk with ghee, and (2) the resin of the silk cotton tree similarly prepared, make two prescriptions beneficial in conditions of diarrhea
37-37½. (1) Oleander, small stinking swallow wort, and Rajakasheruka prepared in milk and mixed with honey, extract berberry and ghee; (2) the banyan and the three other drugs of its group similarly prepared; these two prescriptions of enema [basti] are used in conditions of complications resulting from over-action of the enema [basti].
38-39½. (1) Indian nightshade, Kshirakakoli, painted leaved uraria and climbing asparagus; (2) White teak, jujube, scutch grass, cuscus grass aud perfumed cherry; these two sets of drugs prepared in milk and mixed with ghee, extract of berberry, honey and sugar should be given as cold enema, by the physician, in conditions of hemorrhage.
40-41. Another prescription recom mended for use in this condition of hemorrhage consists of the freshly drawn blood of hare, deer, cock, cat, buffalo, sheep or goat, emulsified and mixed with the milk of cow, sheep, goat or buffalo and with the drugs of the life-promoter group.
42-43. Another enema [basti] prepared from mahwa, liquorice, grape, scutch grass, white teak and sandal-wood, and mixed with honey and sugar may be given in the same way. (1) Indian madder, the two varieties of Indian sarsaparilla, milky yam and liquorice; (2) Sugar, sandalwood, grape, honey, emblic myrobalan and blue lotus; these two sets of drugs are used in conditions of hemothermia. The decoction of gum arabic is given in conditions of urinary anomalies.
44-45. In conditions of Gulma, diarrhea, reverse peristalsis, stiffness and contractures, as also, in conditions of partial or total paralysis and in various morbid conditions of a similar type, the discerning physician should administer enema [basti] prepared with the drugs appropriate for each disease-condition, selecting the prescriptions of various sorts in the manner of the above-mentioned prescriptions.
Summary
Here are the recapitulatory verses—
46-48. The three triads of prescriptions in conditions of Vata and the other two humors, another triad of tetrads for purification of the colon, virilifics, astringents, a dyad of prescriptions in each of the conditions of blennorrhagic condition, burning, griping pain, diarrhea and over-action of the enema [basti]; a triad of prescriptions in hemorrhage, a dyad in hemothermia and one in urinary anomalies thus making a total of thirty-seven prescriptions of most excellent enemas [basti] prepared with a few and easily obtainable drugs and causing little or no discomfort are described herein.
10. Thus, in the Section on Success in Treatment, in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the tenth chapter entitled ‘The Successful Application of the Enema Procedure [basti-siddhi]’ not being available, the same as restored by Dridhabala, is completed.
How Enema cleanses the whole body
15. When the Master had thus delivered his pronouncement and had been duly honoured by the assembled sages, then the band of disciples, greatly pleased, bowed before the teacher and together put the following question.
16. ‘The enema has been declared by the teacher to be possessed of the qualities and actions curative of all morbid conditions; but, seeing that it does not reach up above the umbilical region and comes out from there through the anus, how then does it manage to draw out the morbid matter from all over the body?’
17. To this, the teacher replied ‘It is Vata that controls the entire body in as much as it is the one universal motivation preventing any stagnation or obstruction in the body; and it is always in its own habitat that this Vata, whether by itself or in conjunction with the other two morbid humors gets first provoked.
18.Now, the enema by its purificatory action, regulates the downward movement of this morbid Vata along with, Pitta, Kapha and the fecal matter. And when the Vata is thus quieted it follows that the disease conditions, whenever they may be in the body, are also quieted.
Enema application in animals
19. Then the disciple (Agniveśa) having grasped, by his keen intelligence the full implications of the above theory, went on to question about the. curatives of diseases affecting elephants, camels cattle, horses, sheep and goats; and here again the Master emphasized the supremacy of the enema among therapeutic measures and being besought for further elucidation, he described the modus operandi in each case, as follows:
20. For giving the enema to the elephant and the camel, the receptacle should be made of the bladder of the goat or the sheep. For giving euema to cows and horses the bladder of the buffalo should be used, and for giving the enema to sheep and goats the bladder of an old ox should be used. This is the opinion of the veterinary experts in the administration of the enema
21. The length of the forearm and eighteen, sixteen and ten fingers should be the respective lengths of the enema tube used for the elephant, camel, cow, horse, sheep or goat. It is stated that it is advisable to insert one fourth of the tube into, the rectum.
22. The dose of the evacuative enema for goats and sheep is 64 tolas; in the case of cows etc., it should be twice or thrice in quantity. Tn the case of the camel, it should be 512 tolas in quantity and double that in the case of the elephant. The dose of the unctuous enema should be one eighth of the evacuative enema.
23. Kurchi seeds, costus, liquorice, long pepper, sweet flag, dill seeds, emetic nut, extract of berberry, gur, rock salt and decaradices; these articles are useful in the preparation of all kinds of veterinary enemas.
23½. Holy fig, banyan, Ashvakarna sal, catechu, purging cassia, sal, and palmyra palm are specially useful in enema given to elephants.
24-24½. Ticktrefoil, painted leaved uraria, crane tree, drumstick, Patala, pith of mahwa, wild croton and white flowered leadwort, Palas, ginger grass, deodar and kurroa; the decoction of all this is said to be specially beneficial in the preparation of enema to be given to cows.
25. Palas, wild croton, deodar, ginger-grass and physic nut are regarded specially useful for horses.
25½. Indian tooth-brush, common caper, catechu, purging cassia and the leaves of the bael group of drugs are good for donkeys and camels.
26. The three myrobalans, Palas, wood apple, wild jujube, bael and jujube are good for goats and sheep’.
Perpetual Alters and their Treatment
27. Then, Agnivesha questioned as to who formed the ever-sick class and what was beneficial in their case; and the teacher replied as follows: ‘The ever-sick class comprises the priest, the kings officer, as also the merchant and the courtezan.
28-30. The priest, engaged as he is constantly, in the study and recitation of the scriptural texts, observance of the vows and the daily rites and, ceremonies etc., fails to attend to his bodily good. And similarly, the king’s, officer fails in his duty towards his own body by his preoccupation with, the gratification of the royal mind, and by the demands made on him by the other dependants of the king, the constant anxiety caused by the various responsibilities of his position, as also the constant fear of incurring the displeasure of his masters. As regards the courtezan, being dependent on the whims and moods of men, she devotes herself to their service and is constancy engaged in acts of toilet and beautification, while those, who live by trade are perforce victims to a sedentary mode of life, due to their immoderate passion for the business of selling and buying. All these constantly given to suppressing the natural urges of their body, and can hardly ever afford to have timely meals. These, as also, all those who are given to untimely diet and voidance of excretions and irregular mode of life, are to be included in the category of the perpetually ailing.
31. When the physician has diagnosed the case of obstipation, characterised by pains and aches all over the body as due to provocation of Vata consequent upon suppression of natural urges, he should to begin with administer a suppository well made with unctuous substance.
32-33. He should then prepare an enema by decocting hog’s weed, castor, red physic nut, chiretta, deodar, turpeth, yellow berried night-shade aud the major penta-radices in cow’s urine to which has been added the supernatant fluid of curds. To this decoction should be added oil and ghee; and the salts of the five varieties should be mixed with it. This enema should then be administered to the patient. After the administration of this evacuative enema, the patent should be given a diet of Jangala meat-juices followed by an unctuous enema of oil prepared with the paste of red physic nut.
34-35. Decoct in 256 tolas of water, sida, Indian groundsel, emetic nut, bael, white flowered leadwort, the two varieties of penta-radices, the fruit of purging cassia, barley and horse gram, Add to this decoction the paste of the drugs of the kurchi group. This solution mixed with oil ghee and rock-salt is beneficial to the ever sick, persons and is promotive of vitality and complexion. This should be followed by an unctuous enema prepared with liquorice, or bael fruit or dill seeds.
36. In the case of children, the unctuous enema prepared with the decoction of the drugs of the life-promoter group and the evacuative enema prepared with the same decoctions, and without the addition of salt, should be used. There is no therapeutic measure more rapidly promotive of bodily strength, for infants and the aged, than evacuative enema.
Summary
Here is the recapitulatory verse—
37. The actions of the various fruits and the fruit par excellence, [? in?] enema; the length of the tube of the enema apparatus used in the case of animals, those who constitute the ever-sick class and what is beneficial for them—have all been described in this chapter on the successful use of the emetic nut and the dose of the enema’.
11. Thus, in the Section on Success in Treatment, in the treatise compiled by Agnivesha and revised by Caraka, the eleventh chapter entitled ‘The Successful Use of Emetic Nut and the Dose of the Enema [phala-matra-siddhi]’ not being available, the same as restored by Dridhabala, is completed.
Atreya.
After-treatment for a patient after Purificatory therapy
3-5. When after being duly purified by the procedures of emesis etc., the patient is in a debilitated condition, emaciated, weakened in his digestive power, has his joints loosened, is purged of the morbid accumulations of flatus, urine, mucus and bile, the stomach and the intestines have become contracted, the body has become vacuous and accordingly unable to bear any further strain, he should be protected by the physician from all kinds of risk, just as a tender egg is protected or a vessel brimful of oil, or the kine by the cowherd armed with his staff.
6. The physician who is conversant with the order and sequence of therapeutic procedures, should put the patient on a liquid diet beginning with thin gruel and leading upto meat-juices, for the purpose of re-stimulating his gastric fire.
7-8. To this end, he should prescribe the use first of unctuous, acid, sweet and pleasant articles, then of articles of acid and salt tastes, and later, of sweet and bitter tastes, and lastly of all articles of astringent and pungent tastes. In this manner by the use of two antagonistic tastes at a time, and by the alternate use of unctuous and dry articles, the physician should restore the patient to his normal health.
Signs of Restoration to health
9. When the. patient is able to tolerate all the tastes, when there is no retention of excretory matter, when the zest for life has returned, the sense organs have regained their firmness, when strength has returned and the mind is fully composed, it should be known that he is restored to normality.
Contra-indications in one that has not regained health
10-11. So long as the patient has not regained such full measure of health, he should scrupulously avoid all things and activities that are prohibited. He should be particularly careful to eschew the following eight factors which are highly causative of morbidity; loud speaking, jolting in conveyances, excessive moving about and excessive sedentation, indigestion and pre digestion meals, day-sleep and and the sex-act.

Functions of the Redactor
36-36½. The redactor enlarges what is concise and abbreviates what is very prolix and in this manner brings an ancient work up-to-date.
37-38½. Thus this best of all treatises which is replete with truth and wisdom and which has been redacted by the extremely erudite scholar Caraka is now available only in three quarters of the original extent. Accordingly, in order to make the treatise complete Dridhabala born in the town of Pancanada [Pañcanada], restored the lost portion, having propitiated God Shiva, the Lord of creatures.
39-39½. He added seventeen chapters in the Section on Therapeutics as also the two sections of Pharmaceutics and Success in Treatment in entirety, by culling his data from various treatises on the science.
40-40½. Thus, this treatise is not deficient either in respect of diction or in respect of content, and is free from any blemishes besetting scientific treatise and is embellished with the thirty-six canons of exposition.
Thirty-six Canons of the Science
41-44½. The canons of exposition are: (1) Subject matter; (2) Arrangement; (3) Eextension of argument; (4) Import of words; (5) Partial adumbration; (6) Concise statement; (7) Amplification; (8) Supply of ellipsis; (9) Purpose; (10) Authoritative instruction; (11) Adducement of reason; (12) Indication; (13) Implication; (14) Decision; (15) Restatement; (16) Categorical statement; (17) Compromising statement; (18) Exception; (19) Exception to exception; (20) Objection; (21) Right interpretation; (22) Concession; (28) Explanation;(24) Doubt; (25) Retrospective reference; (26) Prospective reference; (27) Technical nomenclature; (28) Deduction; (29) Specification; (30) Illustration; (31) Definition; (32) Injunction; (33) Option; (34) Rebuttal; (35) Re-affirmation and (36) Possibility.
Merits of knowing the Canons
45-45½. These canons of exposition are observed in their entirety in treatises which make use of both the aphoristic and the expository style of expression, while in the treatises which make use of the aphoristic style alone, they are observed only partially.
46 46½. What the sun is to the lotuses in a pond and what the lamp is to the house, the canons of exposition are to the treatise in subserving the double purpose of awakenment and illumination.
47-47½. One who has acquired a good grasp of even one branch of this science will be able to acquire an understanding of the Other branches as well, on account of his being well grounded in general principles.
48. A physician who is not conversant with the canons of exposition, though he may be a student of many treatises will fail to grasp the meaning of these treatises, just as a man fails to acquire wealth when fortune has deserted him.
49. A science, if badly handled, will destroy the inept user, like a weapon badly handled; on the other hand, the self-same science or weapon, rightly handled will become a source of succour.
50. Accordingly, these canons of exposition will be described in extenso again in the supplementary section, with a view to enabling the student to know the real import of this very treatise from a critical standpoint.
